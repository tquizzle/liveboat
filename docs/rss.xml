The explosion at a Hayes substation 1.5 miles from the airport knocked out power early Thursday, requiring 70 firefighters to battle a blaze in a transformer containing 25,000 liters of cooling oil. 

Despite backup generators, Europe's busiest airport couldn't maintain normal operations, forcing flights to divert to airports across Europe and as far as Bangor, Maine. "Contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100%," Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye told the BBC. "This is as big as it gets for our airport." British Airways, which planned to carry 100,000 passengers Friday, prioritized long-haul flights to Australia, Brazil and South Africa when operations resumed after 4 p.m.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe Is Short of Gunpowder and TNT When It Needs Them Most</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS7QRHlVjEk</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yS7QRHlVjEk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Europe is struggling to produce enough gunpowder, TNT, and other explosives and propellants to meet its demand. The European Union has proposed €150 billion ($162.6 billion) in loans to boost defense spending as part of its latest effort to compensate for waning US support. The European Defense Industry Program would provide another €1.5 billion of EU funding to industry players from 2025 to 2027, but the Commission’s regulation has not yet been passed by the European Parliament. Bloomberg's Laura Alviz breaks down the situation.

The system lures crawlers into a "maze" of AI-generated pages containing neutral scientific information, deliberately wasting computing resources of those attempting to collect training data for language models without permission. 

"When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them," Cloudflare explained. The company reports AI crawlers generate over 50 billion requests to their network daily, comprising nearly 1% of all web traffic they process. The feature is available to all Cloudflare customers, including those on free plans. This approach marks a shift from traditional protection methods, as Cloudflare claims blocking bots sometimes alerts operators they've been detected. The false links contain meta directives to prevent search engine indexing while remaining attractive to data-scraping bots.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Chinese Grand Prix Post Sprint Show</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEJK-4_ydio</link><author>FORMULA 1</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dEJK-4_ydio?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 04:22:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_qr75-ydFVKSF9Dmo6izg">FORMULA 1</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join us LIVE as we race the first sprint race of the 2025 season.

The Ukrainian military has been able to turn to Germany for additional air defense systems — one of them called the "IRIS-T". 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that his country has successfully deployed a long-range guided cruise missile. That would expand its ability to strike deep into Russia. 
The so-called Long Neptune is a version of the anti-ship Neptune. Zelenskyy claims the Long Neptune can reach targets up to 1,000 kilometers away.

He was 76.
	The Texas-born Foreman became Heavyweight Champion of the World, and segued into a TV staple and pop culture icon. He was swept up in the swirl of decade-defining events surrounding Muhammad Ali as well as Joe Frazier and other high-wattage pugilists of the 1970s. In the 1990s, Foreman took advantage of the availablity of low-cost TV time to launch his Foreman Grill home grill product through a series of  infomercials that he hosted. 
	Foreman famously had a close call in the ring in 1977 that drove him to quit boxing and declare himself a born-again Christian. He became an ordained minister in 1978 and began preaching in his hometown of Houston. He shocked the sports world when he returned to boxing in 1987 and wound up reclaiming his Heavyweight Champion title in 1994. Foreman retired from the sweet science for good in 1997.

	
	In addition to his business ventures, Foreman led Houston’s Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, where he preached four times a week.



	In recent years, Foreman had been involved with numerous documentary projects about his life, boxing and the era of his greatest fame. He was also the subject of the 2023 biopic “Big George Foreman,” from director George Tillman Jr. Khris Davis played Foreman in the Mandalay Pictures drama that focused on his improbable return to the ring in the 1980s and ’90s.
	Foreman’s family confirmed his death in an Instagram post on Friday.
	Born Jan. 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in extreme poverity in the east Texas city of Marshall, about 40 miles west of Shreveport, La. He first gained national fame after winning an Olympic gold medal in boxing at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City.
	“Foreman often bullied younger children and didn’t like getting up early for school. Foreman became a mugger and brawler on the hard streets of Houston’s Fifth Ward by age 15,” according to Foreman’s official website.
	He was eventually steered into boxing through the Lone Star state’s Lyndon B. Johnson Job Corps program. Foreman gained stature in the late 1960s and ultimately secured the Heavyweight Championship in January 1973 by defeating Frazier with six knockouts in a bout held in Kingston, Jamaica. The event also had the distinction of being the first boxing broadcast to air on the then-fledgling pay TV service HBO.

	
	The following year, Foreman faced a resurgent Ali in the event that received worldwide attention as the “Rumble in the Jungle,” held in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ali pummelled Foreman in the ring and dominated him on the PR front as well. Foreman went on to went his next five fights by knockout.
	After his triumph of becoming the world’s oldest Heavyweight Champion, Foreman became a boldface name staple on TV, from daytime talk shows to “The Tonight Show” and “Late Night With David Letterman.” He was known for his folksy charm and for having a sprawling family of children and grandchildren. And his low-cost cooking device that allowed for easy indoor grilling — the George Foreman Lean Mean Grilling Machine — became a retail and direct response sales juggernaut starting in the early 1990s.
	Foreman also starred in the short-lived 1993 ABC family comedy “George,” playing a retired boxer who runs an after-school program for troubled students. He hosted NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” in 1994.
	Foreman had cameos and small roles in a host of TV shows and movies over the years, playing himself or a similar character, including “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,” “The Fighter,” “The Masked Singer,” “The Larry Sanders Show,” “Home Improvement” and “King of the Hill.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How does mover work with VMs and what&apos;s the best way to back VMs up?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1jgyqiw/how_does_mover_work_with_vms_and_whats_the_best/</link><author>/u/Proper-Novel4527</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 02:50:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - UnRAID</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I created a Windows VM on my cache drive a while ago, and I booted up a game to test something out, and it gave me a warning stating that the game was running off of an HDD and it was highly recommended to run it on an SSD instead. I thought mover might have moved the vdisk to the array, and so I checked the settings of the domains share and saw it was set up to move things from the cache to the array. But then I double checked and the VMs were actually on the cache drive and in the VM it was showing the storage as an SSD. I imagine the warning in the game was because it got confused by running in a VM or something.But then that got me wondering, why didn't mover move the VMs to the array if the share was configured to do so?Also, that got me thinking I would like the VMs to be backed up to the array occasionally. Is there a tool or a good way to back them up on a schedule, keeping them on the cache drive and having one copy of each on the array that gets replaced during the next backup? Sorry if this is a basic question, I haven't played around with VMs very much yet. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>gemma3:1b - ollama &amp; open-webui</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jgyi4y/gemma31b_ollama_openwebui/</link><author>/u/microzoa</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 02:37:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Raspberry Pi</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is anyone running this?

Amazon plans to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by March-end, a process the company says is now complete and affected a "relatively small subset of employees." 

"The way to get ahead at Amazon is not to go accumulate a giant team and fiefdom," Jassy told employees, stressing that successful leaders "get the most done with the least amount of resources." Jassy has established a "No Bureaucracy" email alias that has received over a thousand suggestions, leading to more than 375 changes aimed at speeding operations. "It's a meritocracy," Jassy said, urging employees to "move fast and act like owners."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Train Station Tracker LED Map</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jgxbgj/train_station_tracker_led_map/</link><author>/u/SiberianForestCats</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 01:35:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Raspberry Pi</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I plan on making a decorative map with LED bulbs marking each train station that light up each time a train is arriving.I plan on using the CTA API to create my program but where I’m having issues researching is the physical components.

From what I understand, I can get individually addressable LEDs and connect or solder them together in a daisy chain to my Raspberry Pi 4. Questions I have: - Would that be all I need to do in order to individually control each bulb? - Do I need a separate 5V power supply? There are 146 stations (so I would need 146 bulbs Daisy chained together and theoretically all 146 bulbs, need to be able to light up at once) I plan on hooking it all up to a single GPIO pin. - What python package should I use to write the code to control the bulbs individually? - Would this type of addressable LED work?

Rinsch, 47, was arrested in West Hollywood this week on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions that could result in decades of imprisonment if convicted. The FBI and Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York allege Rinsch diverted funds meant for his series "Conquest" to speculate on cryptocurrency, stay in luxury hotels and purchase high-end items including five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari. 

Netflix had paid Rinsch $44 million between 2018 and 2019 for the science fiction project about an artificial humanlike species. Prosecutors say he then requested an additional $11 million but never completed the production. An arbitrator ruled in Netflix's favor last year, ordering Rinsch to pay the company $11.8 million. Rinsch appeared in federal court with shackles and posted a $100,000 bond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Callouts</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1jgwkh7/callouts/</link><author>/u/DeveloperOfCodeLLC</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:57:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Obsidian</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am currently using the Obsidianite theme and I love it.

If my analysis shows that there is any reasonable likelihood that we have infringed in any way any of Monster Cable’s intellectual property rights, we will of course take any and all action necessary to resolve the situation.  If I do not hear from you within the next fourteen days, or if I do hear from you but do not receive all of the information requested above, I will assume that you have abandoned these claims and closed your file. As for your requests for information, or for action, directed to me: I would remind you that it is you, not I, who are making claims; and it is you, not I, who must substantiate those claims.  You have not done so. I have seen Monster Cable take untenable IP positions in various different scenarios in the past, and am generally familiar with what seems to be Monster Cable’s modus operandi in these matters.  I therefore think that it is important that, before closing, I make you aware of a few points. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1985, I spent nineteen years in litigation practice, with a focus upon federal litigation involving large damages and complex issues.  My first seven years were spent primarily on the defense side, where I developed an intense frustration with insurance carriers who would settle meritless claims for nuisance value when the better long-term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle. In plaintiffs’ practice, likewise, I was always a strong advocate of standing upon principle and taking cases all the way to judgment, even when substantial offers of settlement were on the table.  I am “uncompromising” in the most literal sense of the word.  If Monster Cable proceeds with litigation against me I will pursue the same merits-driven approach; I do not compromise with bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds. As for signing a licensing agreement for intellectual property which I have not infringed: that will not happen, under any circumstances, whether it makes economic sense or not. I say this because my observation has been that Monster Cable typically operates in a hit-and-run fashion.  Your client threatens litigation, expecting the victim to panic and plead for mercy; and what follows is a quickie negotiation session that ends with payment and a licensing agreement.  Your client then uses this collection of licensing agreements to convince others under similar threat to accede to its demands.  Let me be clear about this: there are only two ways for you to get anything out of me.  You will either need to (1) convince me that I have infringed, or (2) obtain a final judgment to that effect from a court of competent jurisdiction. It may be that my inability to see the pragmatic value of settling frivolous claims is a deep character flaw, and I am sure a few of the insurance carriers for whom I have done work have seen it that way; but it is how I have done business for the last quarter-century and you are not going to change my mind.  If you sue me, the case will go to judgment, and I will hold the court’s attention upon the merits of your claims–or, to speak more precisely, the absence of merit from your claims–from start to finish. Not only am I unintimidated by litigation; I sometimes rather miss it.I can relate to Denke’s final comment quoted above ….  I wonder what the attendant publicity is doing for his sales.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: International Olympic Committee holds press conference after the 144th session concludes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi6j1GY77E4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fi6j1GY77E4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:25:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as the International Olympic Committee holds a press conference at the conclusion of the 144th session in Olympia and Costa Navarino, Greece.

"One aspect of that is we need builders and it's part of the reason why earlier today we've brought back the level of the capital gains so that those who take those risks get the rewards."Temporarily waving the one-week employment insurance waiting period.Temporarily allowing businesses to defer corporate income-tax payments and GST and HST remittances.Deploying a new financing facility (the Large Enterprise Economic and National Security Facility).Implementing a "one window" approval process to speed up major projects. Doubling the Indigenous Loan Guarantee to $10 billion, unlocking access to capital for First Nations, Inuit and Métis.Providing more funding for regional development agencies.Removing any mobility restrictions for federally regulated professions. Carney said removing barriers to the free movement of workers, goods and services would increase the size of Canada's economy by $250 billion — equivalent to more than $6,000 for every Canadian.He said he is proud the federal government moved on a number of projects today, such as the Cedar LNG and LNG Canada in B.C. and Port of Churchill in northern Manitoba. "It's high time to build," Carney said. Carney told reporters he would maintain a carbon emissions cap, but that legislation isn't enough to reduce emissions, which is why, he said, he is "focused on action."  "One of the projects, I firmly believe this, of national significance is major investments in carbon capture and storage," he said. "We have the opportunity not just to get emissions down but very importantly to create an entirely new industry that will serve Canadians well but will create exports and jobs and opportunities for many decades."The Conservative Party later alleged Carney was lying about his support of Canada's oil and gas industry."If Carney was sincere, he would immediately commit to the full repeal of the Liberals' C-69, the 'No More Pipelines' Act, C-48, the West Coast Tanker Ban, and the production cap," the party said in a statement. "Instead he doubled down on capping Canadian energy production."Carney's announcement about a national development strategy is also reminiscent of Conservative campaign promises.Just yesterday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que., that he plans to create "shovel-ready zones" with pre-approved construction permits for major resource or energy projects if elected.In 2019, Conservative Andrew Scheer, leader of the Official Opposition at the time, pledged that if elected, his government would build a single coast-to-coast energy corridor to transport natural resources.Most premiers in agreement: FordIn a scrum with reporters following the meeting, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said most premiers agreed about eliminating trade barriers, with he and the federal government intending to clear all exemptions."Nova Scotia is clearing all exemptions. As we move across the country, eventually everyone is going to hop on," he said. "They'll have no choice but to hop on board. Not forced, but there will be so much pressure within their territory or their province."Ford repeated that all options remain on the table, including potentially increasing an energy tax on the U.S. despite Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's opposition to that approach. WATCH | Carney presents national strategy:"Ontario will decide that. No other jurisdiction," he said. "I don't worry about her oil and she doesn't have to worry about my energy."Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and B.C.'s David Eby attended virtually, as did Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey who is in Japan for a trade mission.Ford reiterated that he would work with anyone as long as it's in Ontario's best interest. New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt voiced support for Carney, saying in French that she is "very happy" to have him as prime minister while Canada is under tariff threats. "From what I've seen of Mr. Carney and the conversations we have had, his passion for Canada shines through, his intelligence shines through," she said. She said she has yet to meet with Poilievre and doesn't have a comparison point. Legault wants 'global negotiation'  Shortly after arriving for the meeting, Quebec Premier François Legault told reporters that he wants the next prime minister to ask Trump for a "global" negotiation of a trade agreement rather than one that is piecemeal."Right now, Mr. Trump doesn't respect the agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, especially on steel and aluminum. So it's important we renegotiate all the agreement," he said.He said premiers and the prime minister need to be careful about counter-tariffs and "eventual" counter-tariffs to maximize the negative impact on U.S. businesses but minimize the impact on Canadian ones. The Quebec premier said his province would be "open" to pipeline projects, due to Trump's threats, but there needs to be social acceptability.Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai acknowledged that, with increased focus on the North and the Arctic, it's important to hear the plans of all political parties for the region, especially in light of the rhetoric south of the border.Pillai said he wants to make sure the prime minister is aware that it is a "special moment in time for us" and that his visit to Iqaluit, the first domestic trip of his leadership of Canada, was "important and set a tone.""Other people are focusing on the North and we sure need to do the same," Pillai said. "In the first week, personally, I'm very impressed with what I've seen."Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok agreed, saying it was great to see Carney underline "how important the North is and how much incredible of an opportunity we have to provide the country with an opportunity to diversify."Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew emphasized the need for a "solid plan for Canada's economy" because the country is "fighting a trade war on two fronts.""Trump tariffs certainly attract so much attention, but in Manitoba and in Western Canada, the tariffs from the People's Republic of China on canola and pork are having a major impact already," Kinew said.With files from CBC's Olivia Stefanovich, Lisa Mayor, Meagan Fitzpatrick, Kate McKenna, Raffy Boudjikanian]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta settles UK ‘right to object to ad-tracking’ lawsuit by agreeing not to track plaintiff</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/meta-settles-u-k-right-to-object-to-ad-tracking-lawsuit-by-agreeing-not-to-track-plaintiff/</link><author>Natasha Lomas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A human rights campaigner, Tanya O’Carroll, has succeeded in forcing social media giant Meta not to use her data for targeted advertising.

From a report: The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose, seeks class action status and unspecified financial damages on behalf of those who purchased Apple Intelligence-capable iPhones and other devices. "Apple's advertisements saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone's release," the suit reads. 

"This drove unprecedented excitement in the market, even for Apple, as the company knew it would, and as part of Apple's ongoing effort to convince consumers to upgrade at a premium price and to distinguish itself from competitors deemed to be winning the AI-arms race. [...] Contrary to Defendant's claims of advanced AI capabilities, the Products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance. Worse yet, Defendant promoted its Products based on these overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[FS][US-MD] 2 Nvidia Jetson Nano Dev Kits</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1jgui4p/fsusmd_2_nvidia_jetson_nano_dev_kits/</link><author>/u/b0rnks</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 23:18:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab Sales</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Selling 2 Nvidia Jetson Nano Dev Kits.

But I can tell you if we did, we're very well-equipped to handle it," he said.He also rejected reports that his adviser Elon Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China - a rare suggestion that his far-reaching role in the administration will face limits."Elon has businesses in China," he said. "And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that."The president confirmed he would be speaking to China's president Xi Jinping about tariffs. Mr Trump also said there was flexibility on his controversial economic measure.It comes as Mr Trump expressed enthusiasm for possibly becoming a member of the Commonwealth.Sharing an article on his Truth Social network about plans to allegedly make the USA the next associate member, the President wrote: "I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!"'Our allies are calling constantly'The plane's design remains a closely-held secret, but would likely include stealth, advanced sensors, and cutting-edge engines.The initial contract to proceed with production on the jets is worth an estimated $20bn (£15.5bn).Enable CookiesAllow Cookies OnceMr Trump said the jets will be built over several years and "it's something nobody has ever seen before"."Our allies are calling constantly," Trump said, adding foreign sales could be an option. "They want to buy them also."After saying the US would "tone down" the new jets by 10% for any sales to allies, Trump said: "[It] probably makes sense, because someday, maybe they're not our allies."Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the programme as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7tr (£1.01tr) over its lifespan.'I'll pay out of my own pocket'Meanwhile, Mr Trump said he will pay NASA astronauts  overtime pay after their trip to the International Space Station lasted nine months longer than planned.A reporter at the news conference said the pair are not entitled to overtime pay, prompting Mr Trump to say: "If I have to, I'll pay it out of my own pocket."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Youth uprisings in Turkey: What is driving students&apos; outrage over Istanbul mayor&apos;s arrest? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnbe2VdW2FY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cnbe2VdW2FY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:20:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DW's Julia Hahn speaks to protesters on the ground in Istanbul after the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

While I appreciate the input, my approach reflects my personal needs and working style. Here’s what my vault represents for me:My brain is naturally forgetful, so I rely on an external system to capture everything from work ideas to leisure notes.Research in cognitive load theory shows that offloading information can enhance productivity and reduce mental strain.Instead of compartmentalizing by strict minimalism, I’ve created one unified space that covers:  A dedicated area for professional projects and ongoing learning. Sections for brainstorming, drafting, and refining ideas for articles and videos.Leisure and Entertainment: A playful corner for personal interests and inspiration.Relationships and Business Management: Tools to keep track of networking, collaborations, and day-to-day administrative tasks.While minimalist systems work for some, I’ve found that a more comprehensive and interlinked structure suits my thought process best.This vault isn’t just a note-taking system—it’s a dynamic, all-in-one tool curated to fit my unique workflow.I’m excited to share some screenshots of my vault. I hope you find inspiration in the way I’ve embraced what others might call “organized chaos.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cloudflare turns AI against itself with endless maze of irrelevant facts</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/robot_maze_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, web infrastructure provider Cloudflare announced a new feature called "AI Labyrinth" that aims to combat unauthorized AI data scraping by serving fake AI-generated content to bots. The tool will attempt to thwart AI companies that crawl websites without permission to collect training data for large language models that power AI assistants like ChatGPT.Cloudflare, founded in 2009, is probably best known as a company that provides infrastructure and security services for websites, particularly protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and other malicious traffic.Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare's new system lures them into a "maze" of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler's computing resources.

Sometimes a Landscape painting is anything but a painting of a landscape. 

This is a film about José María Velasco, an artist who specialised in incredibly detailed landscapes, and was once a household name - but now is practically unknown outside the country of his birth, Mexico.

When thinking about Mexican nationalism and cultural identity, figures like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera often take centre stage. Their iconic works have become synonymous with Mexican art. However, Velasco’s landscapes, particularly The Valley of Mexico, are often overlooked in these discussions.

   Frink is a practical calculating tool and programming language designed to
   make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out
   right, and to make a tool that's really useful in the real world.  It
   tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all
   calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps
   you easily verify that your answers make sense.  It also contains a large
   data file of physical quantities,
   freeing you from having to look them up, and freeing you to make
   effortless calculations without getting bogged down in the mechanics.
  
   Perhaps you'll get the best idea of what Frink can do if you skip down to
   the Sample Calculations further on this
   document.  Come back up to the top when you're done.
  
   Frink was named after one of my personal heroes, and great scientists of
   our time, the brilliant Professor John Frink.  Professor Frink noted,
   decades ago:
  "I predict that within 100 years, computers will be twice as powerful,
     ten  times larger, and so expensive that only the five
     richest kings of Europe will own them."
   For those with a short attention span like me, here are some of the
   features of Frink.
  Tracks units of measure (feet,
    meters, tons, dollars, watts, etc.) through all calculations and allows
    you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them effortlessly, and makes
    sure the answer comes out correct, even if you mix units like gallons and
    liters.

   Arbitrary-precision math, including huge
    integers and floating-point numbers, rational numbers (that is, fractions
    like 1/3 are kept without loss of precision,) complex numbers, and
    intervals.

   Date/time math (add offsets to dates,
    find out intervals between times,) timezone conversions, and
    user-modifiable date formats.

   Translates between several human
    languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,
    Korean, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Swedish, and Arabic.

   Supports Unicode throughout, allowing
    processing of almost all of the world's languages.

   Supports Interval Arithmetic (also
    known as ) in calculations, allowing you to
    automagically calculate error bounds and uncertainties in all of your
    calculations.

   Installs itself on your system in seconds using Java Web Start and automatically keeps itself
    updated when new versions of Frink are released.

   User interface has a Programming Mode
    which allows you to write, edit, save, and run extremely powerful programs
    even on a handheld device.

   Frink has a simple but powerful system for drawing graphics which are resizable, support transparency
    and anti-aliasing, and can be printed or written to image files.  Graphics
    can also have exact lengths, so that a 3-centimeter line is three
    centimeters long when printed.

   
   Frink follows a rapid release schedule and is updated often.  That
   doesn't mean that old programs will be invalidated, but that new, useful
   features and optimizations are added all the time.
  
   Keep an eye on the What's New
   page to see new features and keep abreast of its developments.
  
   While that page is the most detailed and constantly-updated source of
   information about changes in Frink, I also announce new features on
   Twitter at @frinklang.  And if
   you want to follow Alan's personal ramblings for some reason, those are at @aeliasen.
  
   You can read (and watch using RealPlayer) my presentation Frink -- A Language for Understanding the
   Physical World that I gave on Frink at the Lightweight Languages 4
   conference at MIT.  This discusses some of the design decisions of Frink,
   how it has evolved, implementation details, and future directions for the
   language.
  
   If you have a frames-enabled browser, and you don't see a Frink sidebar to
   the left, you can also click here to try Frink in
    a sidebar as you read this.  (The sidebar mode doesn't give as many
   hints, though.)
   On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,
   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and
   double-clicking the  file.  For more
   startup options, see the Downloading Frink
   section.
  
   Another method of installation requires Java Web Start, which is installed
   with most versions of Java.  Using Java Web Start  used to
   be a great way to run Frink if you don't need to run programs from the
   command-line.  (But you  still write and run programs from the
   GUI using Java Web Start!)  If you do want to run programs from the
   command-line, see the Downloading Frink
   section below.  Java Web Start will allow you to automatically get the
   latest version of Frink and will update Frink automatically when new
   versions are available.
  If you  have a recent version of Java, you can get it from Sun.
    (Link opens in new window.)
     
     Most major browsers have now disallowed Java plugins to
    run in the browser.  However, if you have a Java Virtual Machine
    installed, you probably still have Java Web Start installed, which you
    need to invoke from the command-line with the command
    .  In Fedora, you can make sure this is installed by
    installing the  package from your package manager,
     as root, typing  and then
    one of the commands below.  In Debian-like environments, you may install
    this by installing the  package,  as
    root, typing apt-get install icedtea-netx and then one of the
    commands below.

    If you're using Java version 7u51 or later, they
    silently and incompatibly decided to change default security settings so
    you'll need to open the Java Control Panel to allow Frink to run.
    Otherwise you will see a dialog that says something like "Application
    blocked by security settings" or "Your security settings have blocked a
    self-signed application from running."  (This silent change was made after
    12+ years of the aforementioned method working fine.)
    
     The best way to allow Frink to run is to follow the instructions listed here and add 
     to the exceptions list in step 7.
     
      As always, Java's instructions and installer are
     terrible, and the Java Control panel on Windows may actually be under
     your Start menu as  | , or
     under your Windows Control Panel, or if you start your Control Panel and
     don't see it, Java's control panel will be hidden under "32-bit Control
     Panel."  And sometimes you'll have multiple versions of Java installed
     and the one that gets started isn't the latest version. I had
      of problems until I manually uninstalled  the
     versions of Java on the Windows machine, reinstalled the latest version,
     and uninstalled Frink and reinstalled it.  Sorry about that.  Windows and
     Java integration is terrible.  (The  package for
     Fedora and other installations contains a vastly better implementation of
     Java Web Start.)

   Click one of the options below to install Frink: (see the screenshots below):
    Swing Interface
      Prettier.  Requires Java 1.5.0 or later.
       If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,
       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:
      javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frink.jnlpSwing Interface with standard
       libraries.  This is a version of Frink that contains a variety of standard libraries and useful programs.
      It's a larger download, but the standard libraries change somewhat
      infrequently and should only get downloaded when changes are made.

       If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,
       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:
      javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frinkwithlibs.jnlpAWT Interface -
      Not as pretty as the Swing mode, but will run on older JVMs.
       If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,
       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:
      javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frinkawt.jnlp
   If you've read those security notes, and understood
   what the security messages are telling you, and the warnings are still too
   scary, (and you don't want to send me the $400 per year it would cost me to
   remove at least one of them,) and you'd rather download a limited version
   of Frink that runs in the most restrictive security sandbox (breaking some
   features), then click here to install
   a limited version of Frink. Again, please read those security notes to see what
   features will be unavailable if you choose this option.  You can always get
   the full version of Frink later if you need those features.
  
   If someone wants to send me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign "Code
   Signing Cerificate", I'll sign it just for you.  It won't work any
   differently.)
  
   If you have an old version of Java Web Start, Frink will probably show up
   in the "Downloaded Applications" section of the Java Web Start panel which
   isn't immediately visible.  Use the  menu option to select
   the Downloaded Applications tab.  It will also let you create a Frink
   shortcut on your desktop or in your start menu.  The defaults in Java Web
   Start before version 1.4.2 are set oddly so that the  time
   you run Frink, it will ask you if you want to make a shortcut.
  
   If you're using Linux, and Sun's Java release, only Java version 1.5 beta
   and later will install shortcuts onto your desktop and start menu.  Highly
   recommended.
  
   The Swing version allows mixed fonts and colors.  Due to some performance
   bugs in Sun's Swing implementation (like large paragraphs taking several
   minutes to paint every time you resize or scroll,) it can be problematic.
   As of 2008-08-25, the capabilities of the Swing and AWT interfaces are
   about the same.
  
   The AWT user interface has several modes.  The two-line conversion mode and
   programming mode are shown below.  Small
   devices usually can't run Swing, but all Java platforms should be able to
   run AWT.
  
   If your web browser supports Java 1.3.1 or later, try the Java Applet-based interface.  It looks and
   works just like the GUI above, but it requires you to be connected to the
   internet and must download for each session.

   Your browser must support Java 1.3.1 or later, or you will need to get download a newer version of Java
    from Sun.  It is extremely highly recommended that you have Java 1.5.0
   update 2 or later.  This has been tested with Internet Explorer, Netscape
   4.x, Netscape 6+, Mozilla (Windows and Linux), and Opera.
  
   If you don't have a recent version of Java, you can get it from Sun. (Link opens in
   new window.)
  
   (The certificate is just signed by me, so you'll get a warning.
   Network access is necessary to use the network portions of Frink... like
   currency calculations, translations, etc.  If you deny network access, the
   non-network parts of Frink will work just fine.  If someone wants to send
   me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign "Code Signing Cerificate", I'll
   sign it just for you.  It won't work any differently.)
  
   If the applet doesn't work for you, try the
   web interface.
   It should allow you to use the latest version of the Frink engine.  It is
   now powered by Frink Server Pages.
  
   In this web interface, you can enter any Frink expression in the "From:"
   box.  If you also enter a value in the "To:" box, it is treated as the
   right-hand side of a conversion expression (that is, to the right of the
   conversion operator  )
  
   Thus, to convert 10 meters to feet, you can enter
    in the "From" box and
    in the "To" box, or, equivalently, type
    in the
   "From" box and leave the "To" box empty.  It does exactly the same thing.
   On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,
   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and
   double-clicking the  file.
  
   If you're just using Frink for interactive calculations, or are happy using
   the built-in programming mode and you're not writing running programs from
   the command-line, see the 
   Java Web Start section above.
  
   (If you're looking for an installer for handheld devices, like Android, see
   the Small Devices section below.)
  
   If you want to write full Frink programs  run them from
   the commmand-line, you will need to get your own copy of Frink, and
   have a Java 1.1 or later runtime environment on your machine,
   1.4.2+ is recommended as it's less buggy.  The date calculations in
   anything before Java 1.3 are rather bad,) you may download the
   latest executable  file.  (Note that this changes
   almost daily as I do more work, so download often.)
  
   Otherwise, here are the steps to downloading Frink:
  
    If you don't have a recent version of Java, you can get it from Sun. (Link opens in
    new window.)

   (Double-clicking the file you just downloaded might start Frink in GUI
    mode, depending on your operating system.  If that's not enough, read on.)

   
    See the Running Frink section below for
    directions for starting full Frink programs, running from the
    command-line, etc. 
   On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,
   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and
   double-clicking the  file.
  If you want to run Frink in command-line mode, here are a couple of
   sample scripts you can use to start Frink.  You will need to edit them
    to match the paths on your system!
   (Note that the Linux/Unix shell script above has the option to run with
   the  program, which gives you the ability to use the
   up/down arrows to repeat and edit calculations, and even perform unit and
   function completion!  See the instructions inside that file for configuring
   rlwrap, and downloading the optional associated
   files:   unitnames.txt and functionnames.txt)
  
   In the samples below, you may need to replace  or
    with the full path to your Java Virtual Machine,
   whatever that may be.  Note that  is a Windows-only
   command that simply starts Java without opening a console window.  You'll
   probably replace this with  on other platforms.
  
   The most general way to start Frink is to launch the
    class:
  java -cp frink.jar frink.gui.FrinkStarter
    
   (The above starter scripts use this class.  Look at them first.)  By
   default, this starts in text mode but allows many command-line options to
   start in different modes:
  Starts in programming mode with a blank program
      
    Starts the specified filename
      in programming mode (this option is passed by double-clicking a file in
      Windows if you have file associations set up.)
    Starts Frink in Swing mode, using the one-line
      input mode (default is two-line input mode).  This is similar to
      starting Frink and choosing the menu item  or
      hitting .
    Starts Frink in Swing mode, using the multi-line
      input mode (default is two-line input mode.)  This is similar to
      starting Frink and choosing the menu item  or
      hitting .
  
   Other start options are listed below, if you want to use them.  I'd suggest
   using one of the scripts above and modifying it.
  
   To run the jar file in text mode (only), use: java -cp frink.jar frink.parser.Frink 
   To run the jar file with the Swing GUI, (shown above under
   Java Web Start,) use: javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.SwingInteractivePanel 
   The Swing GUI is the default action for the jar file, so this is the same as
   saying:javaw -jar frink.jar 
   To run the jar file with the AWT GUI, which gives access to several modes,
   including programming mode, use: javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.InteractivePanel
    
   To run the jar file and start the AWT GUI in programming mode, use: javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.ProgrammingPanel
    
   To run the jar file and start the Swing GUI in programming mode, use: javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.SwingProgrammingPanel
    
   If a single filename is specified in programming mode, this file will be
   loaded into the interface.
  
   To run the AWT GUI in full-screen size (this is primarily for small
   devices,) use: javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.FullScreenAWTStarter
    
   Depending on your operating system, I recommend that you write a shell
   script, batch file, or create a shortcut to let you run this even more
   easily (see below for samples.)  To exit, use Ctrl-C, or send your
   platform's end-of-file character (usually Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-D), possibly
   followed by carriage return.  Or just close the window.
  
   See the Proxy Configuration below for
   additional options if you're running behind a HTTP or FTP proxy server.
  
   Arguments passed in on the command-line are treated as names of Frink
   programs to be executed.  Other command-line options are listed below.
  
   If you just want to have Frink calculate something and exit, you can pass
   arguments on the command line using the 
   switch. Each command-line argument following the -e will be interpreted as
   a Frink expression, making it easy to run Frink from other applications:
  java -cp frink.jar frink.parser.Frink -e "78 yards -> feet"
   Other command-line options:
   Allows you to specify
    multiple Frink source files to load and run.  Multiple  options may be specified.  If this option is
    specified, the specified file will  receive any following
    command-line arguments. The  switch is no longer
    required or recommended unless you are loading multiple files.
    Normally, you will just specify the filename to load as the last
      command-line argument.
      
       For example, to load your own definitions from
        before loading the main program
       , you may do something like:
      frink -f mydefs.frink main.frink Remain in interactive mode
      after loading files or parsing command-line arguments.  This is very
      useful if you want to load definitions from one or more files and then
      go into an interactive session.

   Specify a different
      units file than the default.  This allows you to change the fundamental
      dimensions that you like to use, or change my definitions that you don't
      agree with.  You can download my 
      latest data file (normally included
      in the  file) and modify it to suit your needs.Don't load a units file at all
      on startup.  This will improve startup time, but will break all programs
      that use any of the standard units.  No units of measure will be defined
      at all.

    Appends the specified path to the paths that will be searched when a
       statement is encountered in a program.  This may be
      either an absolute or relative file path.  You may specify multiple
       arguments on the command-line, and the paths will be
      searched in the order they are specified.
     
    Specify the character encoding of all following Frink program files.
     This option must precede the filename that it modifies. Frink
      programs can now be more directly written in any language and encoding
      system.  This switch is only necessary if your system's default encoding
      (as detected by Java) is different than that of the program file you're
      loading.

      
       The encoding is a string representing any encoding that your version of
       Java supports, ,
       , ,
       , ,
       .  Your release of Java may support more
       charsets, but all implementations of Java are required to support the
       above.  The sample program  
           encodings.frink also demonstrates how to list all of the encodings available on your system (and 
   their aliases.)
      
       If you specify multiple files having different encodings using multiple
        directives, you can use something like
        to set the encoding back to your
       system's default.
      Print out
      the Frink version and exit.  (From inside a program, you can call the
      function  to return the current version.)

   Enables Frink's internal "sandbox" mode
    so you can run untrusted code.  This is different from Java's sandbox, in
    that it enables only Frink's notions of what should and shouldn't be 
    allowed.  It disallows programs to define functions and many other things,
    so it's rarely useful to the end-user, and hardly any programs will run
       this way.  It's really more for my testing.

   Ignores syntax errors when parsing a
    program and attempts to ignore those lines and recover and run the
    program.  Generally a very bad idea, but this flag was added to preserve
    old, excessively-permissive behavior.
  
   Any command-line arguments after the name of the program to be executed
   are passed to the program as an array called
   .
  
   For those who want a standalone, all-in-one Frink download, there is an
   experimental, unsupported version of Frink compiled for Windows
   only using an experimental, unreleased version of the GNU compiler for Java
   (GCJ).  This only works in command-line mode, but requires no other
   downloads and may start up more quickly.  It is appropriate for quick
   calculations and command-line scripts.  Not all functions may work.  Let me
   know about parts that do or don't work for you.  It is compressed with UPX
   to reduce the file size (possibly at the cost of some startup time.)  This
   version starts up more quickly than the Sun JVM, but runs programs about
   5-6 times slower.
  Experimental, Unsupported executable for Windows: frinkx.exe.
  (Unfortunately, it's compiled without optimization, because that pegs the
  CPU for over 72 minutes, and then blows out my system after trying to use
  over a gigabyte of virtual memory.  Anyone want to donate me a new computer
  with tons of memory?  Or try compiling it with -O3?)  For Windows, you can
  use this experimental gcj 4.3
  eclipse-merge-branch version.
  
   Hint:  If you install the gcj package linked above, or have a working GCJ
   (4.3 or later is required) for other platforms, the command line to
   compile with full optimization will be something like:
  
    gcj -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer --main=frink.parser.Frink -o frinkx.exe frink.jar
   Frink can run entirely on handheld devices like the any phone running
   the Android platform, Sony Ericcson P800,
   P802, or P900 smartphone, the Nokia 92x0 Communicator (Nokia 9210,
   9210i, and 9290), and the Sharp Zaurus.
  
   The installer is built as part of the Frink release process, so these
   versions will be up-to-date with the latest Frink.  (The version numbers in
   the installers may not change, though.)
  
   Download the installer for the following platforms:
   - All of Frink's
    functionality, including graphics, is available on the Android mobile
    phone platform.  See the Frink on Android page
    for more information on using Frink on Android.  As Android is a stable,
    complete, widely-available, well-designed, multi-platform and multi-vendor
    environment, it will probably be the primary platform for Frink on
    handheld devices in the future.  Other proprietary platforms that require
    extensive porting and packaging for every phone model may go away.
       
    (despite the
    filename, this isn't ARM-processor specific--it's pure Java, and might
    work on other platforms that use the  package format.)
    Note:  I need help testing and improving this installation package.
    Please contact Alan Eliasen if
    you have experience with Zaurus installer packages.    an  file is just a 
    file, so you can open it up and poke around, but I don't have a Zaurus to
    test on.

    (and perhaps other Symbian Series 80
    devices.)  I need help testing this one.  The Series 80 devices evidently
    crash when you try to add menubars, so some functions are impossible to
    access.  This is a jar file customized for Series 80, and not an
     installer.
  
   Notes about running Frink on other devices, including notes about why I
   probably  provide releases for newer Symbian devices that
   require their "Symbian Signed" abomination, please see this FAQ entry.
  
   If you have problems running any of these, please contact Alan Eliasen.  Since I don't own
   any of these devices, I rely on others for testing and detailed bug
   reports.  (The emulators don't always work like the real devices!)  It's
   possible for bugs to slip in that work under normal testing, but cause
   problems on the limited/different JVMs on these devices.
  
   If anyone knows of a Symbian 6.0 device with the "Quartz" user interface
   that supports PersonalJava, please let me know and I can give you an
   installer to test.
  
   If you know of a device that supports PersonalJava 1.1 or better, including
   the  package and floating-point math, and you think
   Frink would run on this device and you would like to help test it, please
   suggest it to me..
  
   If you want a unified environment to write, run, save, and load Frink
   programs, try the programming mode.  You can either start this mode
   explicitly (see the Running Frink section
   below) or, from the AWT GUI, choose the menu option .
  
   This mode is primarily designed to allow programming on small devices, but
   can run on any platform.
  
   The  menu option allows you to choose between the standard data file and an alternate data
   file.  You'll usually want to use the standard data file, but on small
   devices, it can take a long time to start your program, and may use a fair
   amount of memory.  The standard data file is big.  In that case, you may
   want to make a pared-down (or even empty) units file and use that when
   running your programs.
  
   For now, selecting a different data file is not a persistent setting.  This
   setting will only remain in place until you exit Frink.
  
   You can specify the width or the height of the window for
   frink.gui.InteractivePanel or
   frink.gui.SwingInteractivePanel or 
   frink.gui.FullScreenAWTStarter.
   You may specify width or height or both.  For example:
  java -cp frink.jar frink.gui.SwingInteractivePanel
    --width  --height Sets the width of the window in
      pixels. 
   Sets the height of the window in
      pixels. 
   Sets the font size in points.
  
   There are several things you can do to make your Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
   run Frink more quickly:
  
    Java 8 contains my algorithmic improvements to make large integers work
     more quickly for multiplication, base conversion, etc.  (It
    only took the Java people 11+ years to import my patches.)  If you want
    faster integer and decimal performance, make sure you are
    using Frink:The Next Generation and Java
    1.8 or later which uses my vastly improved algorithms.
    
   For long-running programs, if you're using Sun's Java Virtual Machine
    (JVM), use the  command-line switch to the
     executable.  This starts the Server VM which optimizes
    more aggressively and often improves performance of long-running programs
    by a factor of 2, but at the expense of increased start-up time.  Note that
    the server VM may not be available if you just downloaded the Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE), and not the full Java Software Development Kit (SDK).

   If you're  starting long-running programs, and want the
    fastest start-up time,  use the Server VM.
    
   Like all Java programs, Frink can often run much faster if you allow
    the JVM to use more memory at startup, leading to less-frequent garbage
    collection.  In Sun's implementation, this is achieved by passing the
    options  (for maximum Java heap size)
    and  (for initial Java heap size) to
    the  executable.  The  arguments are something
    like  for 256 megabytes.  Note that this is at the expense
    of other processes running on your system, and should be used sparingly
    because allocating too much memory may cause your system to swap
    excessively or run out of memory if set too high.
    
   () If you're doing mostly large integer work
   (factoring, primality testing, other number theory,) where most of the
   runtime is spent in mathematical operations on very large integers, the Kaffe Virtual Machine compiled with the
   incredibly fast GMP numerical libraries
   works literally thousands of times faster than Sun's VM and its horribly
   naïve algorithms.
    
     Make sure that GMP is compiled with the
     configure option --enable-alloca=malloc-reentrant or you'll
     blow out the stack and crash with very large integers.

     As of the 2004-07-18 release of Kaffe, you must now
     explicitly pass the  argument when running
     Kaffe in order to use the GMP libraries.
  
   If you use a HTTP or FTP proxy server, you need to add some options to your
   command lines (say, right after the word ) to use the
   proxy if you want certain functions to work.  HTTP and FTP are used for the
   following:

  
   The following are settings for Sun's distribution of Java 1.4.1.  You may
   need different options depending on your Java distribution.  See
   Sun's
    Networking Properties documentation for more properties you may need
   if you're on a network that requires more proxy settings.
  
   HTTP proxy:-Dhttp.proxyHost=
    -Dhttp.proxyPort=
   FTP proxy:-Dftp.proxyHost=
    -Dftp.proxyPort=
   These settings should  be necessary when using the applet
   version or the Java Web Start version, as these inherit the proxy settings
   from your browser or the Java Web Start Application Manager respectively.
  
   Frink is, first and foremost, designed to make it easy to figure out
   things.  If there's a unifying principle in Frink, it could be considered
   to be the normalization of information.  I'm trying to
   simplify and unify the representation of data so that you can perform all
   sorts of interesting operations on them.  Whatever that means.
  
   Frink is optimized for doing quick, off-the-cuff calculations with a
   minimum of typing, primarily so it can be used with handheld devices which
   can make text entry difficult (especially symbols).  This doesn't mean that
   Frink is unsuitable for doing large, very high accuracy calculations.  It
   does those well, too, and the complicated calculations look just like the
   simple ones.
  
   To give an example, Frink represents  numerical quantities as
   not simply a number, but a number and the units of measurement that
   quantity represents.  So you can enter things such as "3 feet" or "40
   acres" or "4 tons", and add, subtract, multiply, etc. these things
   together.  Frink will track the resulting quantities through all
   calculations, eliminating a large category of errors.  You can add feet,
   meters, or rods all in the same calculation and the details are handled
   transparently and correctly.
  
   It also knows the ways that these units are interrelated-- a length times a
   length is an area; length is a volume (if you believe in the
   hypothetical Z axis); mass times distance times acceleration is energy.  If
   you know something in one system of measurement you can convert it to any
   other system of measurement.
  
   All units are standardized and normalized into combinations a small number
   of several "Fundamental Dimensions" that cannot be reduced any further.
   These are completely arbitrary and configurable but are currently:
  
   Look at the data file for these
   definitions (and my editorializing on the boneheadedness of many these
   choices.)  The data file recursively defines all measurements in terms of
   the fundamental units.
  
   An exponent can be attached to each dimension.  For example, an area is
   length * length which might be represented as .  Of
   course, a negative exponent indicates  by that quantity,
   so meters/second will be displayed as , or acceleration
   (which can be represented as meters per second per second) is represented
   as .
  
   A subtle but important design goal of Frink is to "do the right thing" with
   numbers.  Numeric values are automatically promoted to and from integers,
   rational numbers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and more, all
   without overflow or undefined behavior or rounding error.  Frink tries to
   get the  answer, not the wrong answer as fast as possible.
  
   Numeric values in Frink are represented in one of several ways:
  An arbitrarily large number with no decimal part.
   Represented as a number with no decimal point, () or the special "exact exponent" form
   .  An integer can also contain underscores for better
   readability, An arbitrarily large number which can be written as
    integer/integer ( such as  or  ).
    Rational numbers are first reduced to smallest terms; that is,
     is stored as  and  is
    stored as the integer An arbitrary-precision floating-point number.
    Currently, the number of decimal places calculated or displayed is limited
    to 20 for efficiency reasons.  Any number containing a decimal point is a
    floating-point number, such as  or , as
    well as any approximate exponential such as  or
    .
    
    
     As of the 2018-12-11 release, if a number with a decimal point has the
     "exact exponent" indicator , it is turned into an exact
     rational number or integer.  For example, the new exact SI value for
     Avogadro's number  will become an exact
     integer.  The exponents can also be negative, which will usually lead to
     an exact rational number, such as  which produces the
     exact rational number .
    Complex numbers are any number with an imaginary part.  The imaginary
    unit is specified by the symbol .  For example, .  The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be any
    of the numerical types listed above.An interval represents a range of values, such as 
    where, depending on your interpretation, the actual number is unknown, but
    contained within this range, or the number simultaneously takes on all
    values within the range.  See the Interval
    Arithmetic section of the documentation for more information.
   Frink knows about a wide variety of measurements.  You can usually type a
   unit of measurement in a variety of ways.  Plurals are usually understood.
   Case is important (and somewhat arbitrary until I do some normalization and
   cleanup of the units file, but usually lowercase is your best choice.)  The
   following are all examples of valid units:
   (also one million, just maybe more readable.)
    (1.0x10, or approximately a million (floating-point))
    (1x10, or exactly a million (integer))
    (a dimensionless exact integer)
    (a floating-point number)
    (also a floating-point number)
    (a rational number, preserved as a fraction)
    ("USD" is the ISO-4217 currency code for the U.S. Dollar)
    (for now, shorthand for the U.S. dollar)
    (most common prefixes are allowed.)
       (abbreviations of most prefixes and units are also allowed)
   100001000101111111101101\\2 (a number in base 2)
   1000_0100_0101_1111_1110_1101\\2 (a number in base 2 with
    underscores for readability)
     (a number in base 16... bases from 2 to 36 are allowed)
     (a number in base 16)
     (a number in base 16 with underscores for readability)
     (Common hexadecimal notation)
     (Common hexadecimal notation)
     (Hexadecimal with underscores for readability)
   0b100001000101111111101101 (Common binary notation)
   0b1000_0100_0101_1111_1110_1101 (Binary with underscores for readability)
  
   If you're looking for a specific unit, and don't know how it's spelled or
   capitalized, see the Integrated Help section
   below.
  
   Or, if you're using the web interface,
   type part or all of the name in the "Lookup:" field and click "lookup".
   Selecting the "exact" checkbox will only return exact matches, otherwise
   you will get all lines containing that substring.  Try it for something
   like "cubit" and you'll see that
   there are often lots of variations.
   You'll learn the most if you look at the voluminous and
   fascinating data file for more examples
   of things you can do, and measurements that Frink knows about.
  
   If you don't know the name of a unit or function, but can guess at it, you
   can either read the data file for more
   information, or use the integrated help.  Keep in mind that Frink is
   case-sensitive, so you'll need to use the right capitalization of the names.
  
   Unit or function names can be looked up by preceding part or all of the
   name with a question mark.  This will return a list of all units and
   function names  that string, in upper- or lower-case.
   For example, to find the different types of cubits:
  [homericcubit, assyriancubit, egyptianshortcubit,
    greekcubit, shortgreekcubit, romancubit, persianroyalcubit, hebrewcubit,
    northerncubit, blackcubit, olympiccubit, egyptianroyalcubit,
    sumeriancubit, irishcubit, biblicalcubit, hashimicubit]
   Or, if you want to know the name of the currency used in Iran,
  [Iran_Rial, Iran_currency, Iran]
   Simply enter the name of the unit you're interested in to see its value:
  
   If you want to see the results in specific units of measurement, you
   can use the arrow operator  as described in the
   Conversions section below:
  
   Or, if you want to see the sizes of all the units as a single unit type,
   and they're all the same, you can use the arrow operator on the list.  The
   following sample shows all the different types of cubits the world
   has defined and converts them to inches:
  [homericcubit = 15.5625,
     assyriancubit = 21.6,
     egyptianshortcubit = 17.682857142857142857,
     greekcubit = 18.675,
     shortgreekcubit = 14.00625,
     romancubit = 2220/127 (approx. 17.480314960629922),
     persianroyalcubit = 25.2,
     hebrewcubit = 17.58,
     blackcubit = 21.28,
     egyptianroyalcubit = 20.63,
     sumeriancubit = 2475/127 (approx. 19.488188976377952),
     irishcubit = 500000000/27777821 (approx. 17.99997199204358),
     hashimicubit = 25.56]
   If you don't want to see exact fractions, you can (as always) multiply the
   right-hand-side by  or  (without a zero
   after the decimal point) to get approximate numbers:
  
   If you use two question marks, the units that match that pattern will be
   displayed 
    moonlum = 2500 m^-2 cd (illuminance),
    moondist = 0.002569555301823481845 au,
    moonmass = 73.483E+21 kg (mass),
    moonradius = 0.000011617812472864754024 au,
    moongravity = 1.62 m s^-2 (acceleration) If you use the form with two question marks, you
    convert them to a specified unit with the
    operator, as they have already been converted to a
   single string.
   As of the 2016-07-06 release, the double-question-mark
   operator now returns  with newlines separating each
   entry, instead of a list of strings.
  
   Note that functions are displayed at the end of the list, and can be
   distinguished from units by the square brackets following them:
  
   callistodist = 1.883000000e+9 m (length),
   callistoradius = 2.400000e+6 m (length),
   callistomass = 1.08e+23 kg (mass),
   callJava[arg1,arg2,arg3]
   In addition, the  function will produce a list of
   all functions.
  
   If you're writing Frink programs, you can edit Frink files in your favorite
   text editor.  If that happens to be Emacs or XEmacs, you can download the
   rudimentary Frink mode for
    Emacs.  It's somewhat rough at this moment, but it has syntax
   highlighting, automatic indenting, ability to run interactive Frink
   sessions or programs.  Screenshot is below.
  
   By default, the output is in terms of the "fundamental units".  To convert
   to whatever units you want, simply use the "arrow" operator
    (that's a minus sign followed by a greater-than sign,)
   with the target units on the right-hand side:
   If the right-hand-side of the conversion is in
   double quotes, the conversion operator will both evaluate the value in
   quotes as a unit and append the quoted value to the result.  So, the above
   example could be performed as:
  7239/625 (exactly 11.5824) meters
   In this case, because the ratio between feet and meters is an
   exactly-defined quantity, so the answer comes out as an exact rational
   number.  This is also displayed as a decimal number for your convenience.
   If you just want the decimal value, you can multiply by an approximate
   decimal number (any number containing a decimal point) such as
    or  without anything after the 
   decimal point:
   If you are using the web-based interface, simply enter
   everything left of the arrow in the "From:" box and everything to the right
   of the arrow in the "To:" box.  Or you can enter the whole expression
    the arrow in the "From:" box and leave the "To:" box
   empty.  It does the exact same thing.
  
   If the units on either side of a conversion are not of the same type, Frink
   may try to help you by suggesting conversion factors:
  
     Conformance error -
       Left side is: 15367/625 (exactly 24.5872) m s^-1 (velocity)
      Right side is: 1143/1250 (exactly 0.9144) m (length)
        Suggestion: multiply left side by time
                   or divide left side by
    frequency
        units[time]
        units[frequency]
        to list known units with these dimensions.
   
   If you get an error like this, you can list all the units that have the
   specified dimensions by typing  or
   .
  
   Yes, sometimes it gives digits which aren't significant in results.  As I
   improve the symbolic reduction of expressions, this will get better,
   although I still need to work out ways of specifying and tracking precision
   (and uncertainty?) throughout all calculations.
  
   If the right-hand-side of the conversion is a comma-separated list in
   square brackets, the value will be broken down into the constituent
   units.  For example, to find out how long it takes the earth to rotate on
   its axis:
  siderealday -> [hours, minutes, seconds]
   or, to maintain symmetry with the quoted-right-hand-side behavior noted
   above, arguments on the right-hand-side can be quoted:
  siderealday -> ["hours", "minutes", "seconds"]23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds
   This behavior can also be used to break fractions into constituent parts:
  
   If the first term is the integer  (zero), any leading terms
   with zero magnitude will be suppressed:
  siderealday -> [0, "weeks", "days", "hours", "minutes", "seconds"]23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds
   If the last term is the integer  (zero), any remaining
   fractional part  will be suppressed:
  siderealday -> ["hours", "minutes", "seconds", 0]23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds
   Math is very straightforward: the current parser accepts the normal
   mathematical operators, with normal operator precedence.  (Exponentiation
   first (see notes below,) then multiplication and division, then addition
   and subtraction.  And more tightly parenthesized expressions are performed
   before anything else.)  All expressions can be arbitrarily complex.
   Parentheses can be used to group expressions.
   Whitespace between any two units implies multiplication!
   This has the same precedence as multiplication or division.  If there's one
   thing you need to keep in mind, it's this.  You  parenthesize
   units on the right-hand-side of a division operation, if you expect them to
   be multiplied before the division takes place.
  
   The following are all valid expressions.  (Note
   that if you are using the web-based interface you can enter the right-hand
   side of the arrow operator in the "To:" box.)

      dimensions,  otherwise.  Hint:  use the

   If a number comes out as a fraction, like

   calculation with a non-integer number (that is, one with a decimal point in
   it like ) or by multiplying by , or
   simply  (without anything after the decimal point.)
  
   Both sides of a conversion can be arbitrarily complex.
  
   The implementation of factorials is subtle and important enough to warrant
   a few notes.  The factorial operator 
   follows after an expression and has a precedence 
   exponentiation, following normal mathematical precedence rules.  Yeah, when
   I say  or  or , I'm not
   just being super-enthusiastic about that number.  It's a common
   mathematical operator.
   the factorial of a non-negative integer  is
   the product of all the numbers from  to .  For
   example, the factorial  is equal to
   .  These grow rapidly and become hard to
   calculate, but Frink calculates them exactly.
  
   Here are some notes about the implementation of factorials:
  
  Factorials are calculated once and cached in memory so further
    recalculation is fast.

   There is a limit to the size of factorials that gets cached in memory.
    Currently this limit is .  Numbers larger than this
    will not be cached, but re-calculated on demand.

   When calculating a factorial within the caching limit, say,
    , all of the factorials smaller than this will get
    calculated and cached in memory.

   As of the 2017-04-04 release, calculations of huge factorials larger
    than the cache limit  are now calculated by a binary splitting
     algorithm which makes them significantly faster on Java 1.8 and later.
    (Did you know that Java 1.8's BigInteger calculations got drastically
    faster because Frink's internal algorithms were contributed to it?)

   As of the 2017-04-04 release, functions that calculate binomial
     coefficients like  are more efficient
     because of the use of binary
     splitting algorithms, especially for large numbers.

      is of the number of ways
        things can be chosen  at a time, with
       order being unimportant.  This is sometimes called "m choose n" or "m C
       n".  This is equivalent to  although
       calculating that way 
       often leads to way-too-big numbers.  For example, binomial[10000,
         9998] is equal to 49995000, but if you calculated it naively,
       you'd have to calculate 10000! which is a 35660-digit number, and divide
       it by another huge number, which could be inefficient and slow.
     
     
   By default, all variables in Frink can contain any type.  Variable names
   begin with any (Unicode) letter followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or
   the underscore () character.
  
   You do not need to declare variables before using them.  The variable will
   be defined in the smallest containing scope.
  
   To assign a value to a variable, use the  operator:
    (assigns a single value)  (assigns an array)
  
   Variables  be declared before they are used using the
    keyword.  For example, to
   declare a variable called :
  
   This defines the variable t in the smallest containing scope and sets its
   initial value to the special value .  You may also
   specify an initial value:
  
   When a variable is declared, you can constrain the type of values that it
   can contain.  The constraints are checked at runtime.  If you try to set a
   value that does not meet the constraints, a runtime error occurs.  For
   example, to make sure that the variable  only contains values
   with dimensions of time, you can declare it using the 
   keyword which defines constraints.
  var t is time = 10 seconds
   In this case, the initial value is necessary to ensure that 
   contains a value with dimensions of time .  (The
   special value  is applied if no initial value is
   supplied.)  If a valid initial value is not supplied, this will produce an
   error at runtime.
  
   Multiple constraints can be specified by placing them in square brackets.
    constraints must be met.  (If you want to do an "OR" of
   constraints, see the Constraint
    Functions section below.)
  var t is [time, positive] = 10 seconds
   Built-in constraint types include all of the dimension types defined in
   your program.  For example, you can list all of the defined dimension types
   (length, mass, power, energy) with the
    or the 
   functions.  All of these defined types can be used as constraints.
  
   The following built-in constraints can be used to verify that the value is
   of one of the built-in types.  For example,
  var name is string = "Frink"Value must be a boolean value
       or  (and not just
      a type that can be coerced to boolean; see the Truth section.)
    Value must be a unit of measure of any type (including
      dimensionless numbers).  You will probably use this rarely; it's more
      likely that you'll want to constrain based on dimension type.
  
   A class name can also be a constraint name.  If, for example, you've
   defined a class called , the following will work.
  a is Sphere = new Sphere[]
   This constraint check also works with interface names.  If the name of the
   constraint is the name of an interface, this check will ensure that any
   object assigned to the variable implements that interface.  See the interfacetest.frink file for an example.
  
   You may define your own functions that will be used as constraints.  The
   function must take one argument and return a  value if the
   constraint is met.  Returning  or another value will
   cause the constraint to fail.  The following defines a function called
    that returns  if a value is a
   positive dimensionless value.
  
   You can test to see if a variable is defined using the following functions:
  Returns true if the symbol is
      defined either as a local variable in the current scope (i.e. with the
       operator), or as a unit (i.e. with the 
      operator.)
    Returns true if the
      symbol is defined as a local variable in the current scope (i.e. with the
       operator).
  
   Both functions can be called either with a raw variable name or with a
   string.  For example:
  
    isVariableDefined[a]
    isVariableDefined["a"]
   
   Ha ha...just kidding.  There are no global variables in Frink.  However, if
   you need to access some sort of "global" values from anywhere in your
   program, without passing them explicitly to each function, you can simulate
   it with class-level variables in a class that you define.  These are
   defined using the  keywords, and are similar to
    class-level variables in languages like C++ and Java.
  
   If you want to use a "global" variable in only a few functions, you can
   encapsulate those functions into a .
  
   For samples of class-level variables and how to access them, see classtest.frink.
  
   For internationalization, Frink allows Unicode characters anywhere.  For
   maximum portability, and maximum editability with non-Unicode-aware
   editors, you can use Unicode escapes to embed these characters in program
   files.

  
   Variable names can contain Unicode characters, indicated by
    followed by exactly 4 hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F]
   indicating the Unicode code-point, for example:  .  In
   addition, a Unicode character can be specified with anywhere from one to
   six hexadecimal digits by placing the digits in brackets, for example:
    or  (this is the Unicode
   character "GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES".  So, yes, you can have
   kitty faces as variable names!)  This allows Unicode characters to be
   placed into any ASCII text file, and edited by programs that don't
   understand Unicode.  It also allows  Unicode character to be
   used in an identifier.
  
   If you  have a nifty editor that handles Unicode, or other
   character encodings, you can write your Frink program in full Unicode, and
   load it using the  command-line switch.  Keep in mind that in this
   case, identifiers can only consist of Unicode letters, digits, "other
   symbols" and the underscore.  You still have to use the 
   Unicode escape trick if your identifier contains other classes of
   characters.
  
   For example, Unicode defines the character  for Planck's
   constant.  In the data file, we define Planck's constant as the normal
   character  (which is easier to type) and also as the Unicode
   character.  These definitions look like:
   The  notation simply defines a
    unit, that is available from all functions.
  
   By default, units are displayed with their dimensions given as multiples of
   the
   International System
    of Units (SI) base units.  These are often not very intuitive.  For
   example, volts are displayed as:
  1 m^2 s^-3 kg A^-1 (electric_potential)
   Of course, you could convert to volts explicitly using the
    operator, but if you have to do that repeatedly, it's a
   hassle.  Instead, you can define the default output format for a unit type
   by using the  operator:
  electric_potential :-> "volts"
   The left-hand side is the dimension list identifier like
    or  or 
   (you can see what this is named for any given unit by entering an
   expression of that type--see the first "volt" sample above.)
  
   The right-hand side is any expression that can go on the right-hand-side of
   a conversion operator  , including multiple conversions:
  time :-> [0, "days", "hours", "minutes", "seconds"]365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9.5400288 seconds23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds
   The right-hand-side can even be a function that takes a single argument:
  HMS[x] := x -> [0, "hours", "minutes", "seconds"]
   If you want, you can define a function that displays distances in
   millimeters if it's small, kilometers if it's bigger, and light-years if
   it's huge.
  
   Floating-point calculations are performed to a limited number of digits.
   You can change the number of digits of working precision by the
    function:
  0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
   Note that this will only affect calculations performed  this
   flag is set, of course.  Currently, not all operations (notably
   trigonometric functions) can be performed to arbitrary precision.
  
   You can also see the current working precision by calling the
    function:
  
   By default, floating-point numbers are displayed in scientific notation
   with one digit before the decimal point.  This can be changed to
   "engineering" format where 1 to 3 digits are placed before the decimal
   point and the exponent is a multiple of 3.  This allows you to more easily
   see it as "milli-", "micro-", "million", etc.  The call to enable this is:
  
   Example without engineering mode:
  1.405000000e+8 m (length)
   Now notice the change if you set "engineering mode" to true.  The result
   comes out so you can more easily read it as "140.5 million meters":

  140.5000000e+6 m (length)
   In addition, rational numbers are, by default, displayed with a
   floating-point approximation to their values:
  1/3 (approx. 0.3333333333333333)
   This behavior can be suppressed by calling
   showApproximations[].
  showApproximations[]
   You can tell Frink to always  rational numbers as
   floating-point approximations by calling
   .  The numbers will still continue to be
   represented internally as rational numbers.
  
   Frink tries to produce a human-readable description of units of measure,
   such as "power" or "energy" or "temperature":
  
   This suggestion can be suppressed by calling
   
   Frink allows C/C++/Java-style comments:
  
   If you repeat a calculation, you may want to define it as a function.
   Functions in Frink are denoted by the function name followed by arguments
   in square brackets, separated by commas.  A function can be defined like
   the following:
  circlearea[radius] := pi radius^2
   Then, to call the function, say, to find the area of my telescope mirror,
   which has a radius of 2 inches:
  0.008107319665559965 m^2 (area)
   But that comes out in standard units... let's try again, converting to
   square inches.
  circlearea[2 inches] -> in^2
   You may define multiple functions with the same name but different number
   of arguments.
  
   Multi-line functions can be built; just put the body in curly braces.  It
   may be more legible to use the  statement in your
   function.  For example, the factorial function could be written as:
  
   factorial[x] :=
   {
         return x * factorial[x-1]
         return 1
   If a function does not explicitly return a value, the value returned is the
   value of the last expression evaluated.  A  statement
   with no value on the right-hand-side returns a special void type.
  
   Function declarations can have default values.  Default values are
   specified by putting "" after a parameter name
   in the function declaration.  For example, if your Willard pocket organizer
   goes out, you can use Frink to calculate the tip on your dinner check, and,
   to make it easy, you can default the tip rate to 15 percent of the bill.
   The function declaration with default parameters is:
  tip[amount, rate=15 percent] := amount * rate
   Now, when you get to the restaurant, you can easily calculate the tip using
   the default rate:
  12.1125 dollar (currency)
   Or, if service is outstanding and you want to tip at 20%, you can specify
   the second argument instead of leaving it at the default:
  tip[80.75 dollars, 20 percent]
   The previous tip example probably has you thinking, "Well, it would be nice
   if it calculated the total too!"  I'm bad at math, also... that's why I'm
   developing Frink.
  
   In Frink, values surrounded by square brackets and separated by commas form
   a list of values.  These lists can be returned from a function, assigned to
   a variable, or whatever.  A better version of the above function would
   be defined to return a list containing the tip  the total as a
   list:
  tipandtotal[amount, rate=15 percent] := [amount * rate,
   amount * (1+rate)]
   Note the square brackets on the right-hand-side of the definition.  Then, to
   calculate the tip, it's as easy as before:
  tipandtotal[80.75 dollars][12.1125 dollar (currency), 92.8625 dollar (currency)]
   Yes indeedy-o, functions can be recursive.  The classic example is the
   factorial:
  factorial[x] := x>1  ?  x factorial[x-1]  :  1
   This uses the conditional expression condition ? trueClause :
    falseClause.  The condition is first evaluated (it should evaluate
   to a boolean value,) and if it's true, the true clause is evaluated and
   returned, the false clause otherwise.  Let's try a big number, just big
   enough that it would overflow my old solar calculator:
  119785716699698917960727837216890987364589381425464258
    57555362864628009582789845319680000000000000000
   You can still blow out the stack if you go too deep, or forget to put in a
   condition such that the function terminates.  Don't come crying to me.
  
   Like other variables, formal arguments to functions can have constraints.
   The syntax for constraining is just the same as setting Constraints on variables.  For example,
   if you want to make sure that a function that calculates the volume of a
   sphere is passed a radius, the declaration looks like:
  sphereVolume[radius is length] := 4/3 pi radius^3
   The constraint(s) are checked at runtime, and if all constraints are not
   met, the function call produces an error.
  
   At some point in the future, I'd like to have this choose an appropriate
   function based on the constraints, if more than one is possible.  My
   underlying function dispatching is designed to allow this, but functions
   with constraints may be slower to resolve.
  
   You can control program flow with the if/then/else construct.  If the
   condition is true, it will execute the first clause, otherwise, if there is
   an (optional)  clause, it will execute the
    clause.
  
    if a<10
    {
    } else
       println["Greater than ten."] Note that putting the brackets and statements on separate
   lines is currently important.  Also, please note that the 
   keyword goes on the same line as the closing bracket of the
    clause.
  
   If either the  or  clause is a single
   line, the curly braces for that clause can be eliminated.  The following is
   the same as the code above:
  
    if a<10
       println["Less than ten"]
       println["Greater than ten."]
   The condition must be able to be turned into a boolean value.  When testing
   for equality, be sure to use the double equals sign, (a single equals
   indicates assignment) :
  
   If, for some reason, you need to jam everything into one line, you need to
   add the  keyword:
  
    if a==b then println["Equal."] else println["Not equal."]
   
   Alternatively, there is a conditional operator (sometimes called the
   "ternary operator") that can be placed inside an expression.
   ?  : 
   If  evaluates to , then the result
   is , otherwise the result
   is .
  
   The ternary conditional operator can be used in any expression:
  
    println["I have $numCats " + ( numCats == 1 ? "cat" : "cats" ) + "."]
   
   The condition in an if/then/else statement or a loop needs to be a boolean
   (true/false) value.  This can either be represented by the special values
    and , or the following types can be
   used in places where a boolean value is required:
  Any list (even a zero-element list)The special undefined value 
   Any other value will cause a runtime error.  See the Boolean Operators section below for operators
   that return boolean values.
  
   The  loop is a loop with a condition and a body.  The
   body is executed repeatedly while the condition is true.
  
    i=0
    while i<1000000
       i = i+1
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted:
  
    i=0
    while i<1000000
   You can use the  statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a  loop.  You can use a labeled
    statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the for loop section for an
   example.
  
   You can use the  statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop:
  
    i=0
    while i<1000000
       i = i+1
       while j<1000000
          j = j+1
             break OUTERLOOP //
    Breaks out of both loops
    }
   
   The label must precede the loop  and be followed
   by a colon.
  
   The  loop is a loop with a condition and a body.  The
   body is executed repeatedly until the condition is true.
  
    i=0
    until i>1000000
       i = i+1
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted:
  
    i=0
    until i>1000000
   You can break out of an  loop using 
   and  statements exactly as specified in
   the  loop documentation above.
  
   The  loop is much like the  loop,
   the only difference being that with the  loop, the body of
   the loop is always executed at least once, and then the condition is
   checked.  The body of the loop then repeats as long as the condition is
   true.
  
    i=0
    do
       i = i+1
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted, but each part of
   the loop has to be on a different line:
  
   You can use the  statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a  loop.  You can use a labeled
    statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the for loop section for an
   example.
  
   You can use the  statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop.  See the while loop section of the
   documentation for an example.
  
   The  loop is much like the 
   loop, the only difference being that the body of the loop repeats until the
   condition becomes true.
  
    i=0
    do
       i = i+1
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted, but each part of
   the loop has to be on a different line:
  
    i=0
    do
    until i == 1000
   
   You can break out of a  loop using 
   and  statements exactly as specified in
   the  loop documentation above.
  
   The above  loop can also be written as:
  
    for i = 1 to 1000000
    {
    }
   
   If the body is a single line, the curly braces can be omitted.  The above
   sample can be written as:
  
   The range and step size can be specified using the 
   keyword:
  
   The step is  to be specified for any range in which the
   limits are not dimensionless integers.  For example:
  for i = 0 miles to 1 mile step 1 foot
   This also works with a date range, but the step  be specified
   and it must have dimensions of time:
  for time = #2001-01-01# to #2002-01-01# step 1 day
   A loop can loop over single-character strings.  The loop will normally loop
   upwards, but this can be changed by specifying a negative integer for
   the .  Each value will be a single-character string.  This
   cannot be used to iterate over undefined Unicode codepoints.
  
    for c = "a" to "z"
       print[c]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    for c = "z" to "a" step -1
       print[c]zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
   The boundaries of a loop may also be boolean values:
  
   Other orderings are allowed such as  or
    (the latter only goes through the loop once.)
  
   The  loop is also used to iterate over the contents of
   an enumerating expression or array.  (You can think of it as a "for each"
   loop, which is really what it is.)
  a = ["zero", "one", "two"]
    for x = a
   The  function returns an enumeration of
   all the indices in an array.
  a = ["zero", "one", "two"]
    for i = rangeOf[a]
       println["index $i contains " + a@i]
    index 0 contains zero
    index 1 contains one
   If the enumerating expression produces a list, and you want to break apart
   that list into named variables in the  loop, write it as:
  
    for [, ] = 
    {
    }
   
   Again, if the body is a single line, the curly braces may be
   omitted:
  
    for [var1, var2] = 
   You can use the  statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a  loop.  You can use a labeled
    statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher loop:
  
    OUTERLOOP:
    for i = 1 to 1000
       for j = i to 1001
          if i+j > 1000
       }
   The label must precede the loop  and be followed
   by a colon.
  
   You can use the  statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop.  See the while loop section of the
   documentation for an example.
  
   ( The special keyword  creates an
   enumerating expression that successively takes on all values from the
   beginning to the end, inclusive, with the default step being 1.  (The step
   size can be changed as shown below.)  You can use this 
   notation anywhere to create an enumerating expression that takes on
   successive values.  You can even make it into an array using the
    function:)
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   You can create an more flexible enumerating expression that does the same
   as the above by using the format:  or
    formats.  Use this if you're going to
   assign to variables or use the range symbolically.
  
   For programs that require nested  loops for which it's not
   known in advance how many nested loops will be needed, the
    construct allows multiple loops to be created simply:
  
    multifor [a, b, c] = [1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 5]
       println["$a $b $c"]
   
   An similar (and technically better in almost all ways) way of writing
   the loop above would be to create new  objects:
  
    bounds = [new range[1,2], new range[1,3], new range[1,5]]
    multifor [a, b, c] = 
   A typical idiom for creating a multi-loop is to use the
    function to create array bounds.  For example, the
   following creates in effect 8 nested loops, each running from 1 to 2.  The
   results are assigned as an array to the variable .
  
    upper = 2
    bounds = makeArray[[8], new range[1,upper]]
       println[d]
   
   As of the 2012-09-04 release, the bounds of one loop can now depend on the
   bounds of the loops to its left, for example:
  
    multifor [f,g] = [new range[1,3], new range[f+1,3]]
       println["$f $g"]
   
   You can use the  statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a  loop.  You can use a labeled
    statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the for loop section for an
   example.
  
   There's a version of the  statement that jumps to a
   specified level of a  loop.  The leftmost/highest
   level is level 0, and the next levels increment to the right.  The loop
   must be labeled and the index to jump to follows the label in the
    statement.  For example 
   A Gray code is a sequence in which only one element of the sequence changes
   at a time.  The best-known Gray code is called the "binary reflected Gray
   code" but a large number of different Gray codes are possible.  You can
   iterate through finite and infinite Gray code sequences using
   the  function.
  Finite-length (n, k) Gray Code:  An (n, k) Gray Code is a Gray code
   with  states per element and  elements.  For
   example, the typical binary reflected Gray code is a (2, k) code.  This is
   generated by calling 
   where  and  are integers.  For example to
   generate a binary Gray code with 3 digits:
  
    for c = grayCode[2, 3]
       println[c]
    [0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0]
    [1, 1, 1]
    [1, 0, 0]Finite-length Gray Code with arbitrary states:  You can generate a
   finite-length Gray code where each element can have an arbitrary set of
   states, specified as an array of arrays:
  
    args = [ ["A", "B"], [1, 3, 5] ]
    for c = grayCode[args]
    [A, 1]
    [A, 3]
    [B, 5]
    [B, 1]Infinite-length Gray Code:  You can generate a
   infinite-length Gray code where each element has the same number of
   states.  This is different from the other Gray code examples because the
   least-significant element is returned as element 0 in the array, which gets
   longer as more elements are needed.  For example, to generate a binary
   reflected Gray code, use :
  
    for c = grayCode[2]
       println[c]
    [0]
    [1]
    [0, 1]
    [1, 1, 1]
    [0, 0, 1]
    [1, 0, 1, 1]
    [0, 1, 1, 1]
   Frink can evaluate a string as a Frink expression.  If that means something
   to you, good.  It's cool.  You can make programs that write and run their
   own programs.  Frink became self-aware on December 7, 2001 at 9:26 PM MST.
   This is 1561.926 days after Skynet became self-aware.  History will be the
   judge if  December 7th is another date that will live in
   infamy.
  
   This behavior can also be used to convert a string into a number.  It
   allows users to enter information as any Frink expression such as  or  and have it handled correctly.
   See the Input section below for examples of its use.
   can also be used to perform another layer of evaluation
   on a value that is not a string.
  
   If  is passed an array, all elements of the array will
   be individually evaluated and the result will be returned in an array.
  
   There is also a two-argument version, eval[,
   ] where the  argument is a
   boolean flag indicating if we want evaluation errors to be thrown or just
   suppressed and  returned.  If it is true, errors will be
   rethrown as Java exceptions, otherwise an error returns .
  
   There is also a three-argument version, eval[,
   , ] where the
    argument is a boolean flag indicating if we want
   to hide local variables before evaluation.
  
   The  function restricts some insecure operations from
   being performed ( you can't read files from the local
   filesystem.)  If you need all functions to be available from your
   evaluation, use the intentionally frighteningly-named
   
   Arbitrarily-dimensional, non-rectangular, heterogeneous arrays are
   possible.  (If you're playing "buzzword bingo," you just won.)  Array
   indices are zero-based.  Arrays are indicated by square brackets.
  
   You can break arrays into multiple lines by inserting newlines after the
   commas:
  b = [1, 2, 3,
         4, 5, 6,
   Think of multidimensional arrays as being a list of lists.  For example,
   to create a 2-dimensional array:
  a = [[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6],
   To get elements out, use the lovely @ operator (yes, I'm running out of
   bracket types... square brackets would be indistinguishable from function
   calls):
  
   The method .get[, ]
   can be used to look up the value corresponding to
   the non-negative integer  or return the alternate
   value  if the array does not contain that index.
  
   Arrays can be modified in place and automatically extended:
  [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], Monkey][[1, 2, 42], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], Monkey]
   To get the length of an array, use the  function:
   With the advent of array manipulation, I've proven to myself that Frink is
   capable of simulating a Turing machine, and thus, as of December 12, 2001,
   at 10:16 PM MST, Frink is theoretically capable of calculating anything
   calculable by any other programming language.
  
   To create a new empty array, use the notation:
  
   or use one of the  functions described in the next
   section to create arrays and initialize them.
  
   One-dimensional or multi-dimensional "rectangular" arrays can be
   constructed with the makeArray[,
   ] function where  is an
    of integers indicating the dimensions of the array, and
    is the initial value to set in each cell.
   Multi-dimensional arrays are implemented as arrays of arrays.
  
   Create a 1-dimensional array with 10 elements, with each element
   initialized to 0:
  
   Create a 2-dimensional array with size 3x4, initialized to 0:
  [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
   If called without an initial value, the array is initialized as sparse and
   compact to conserve memory, but you may get errors if reading elements
   you haven't initialized.
  
   Array elements can still be assigned to, and the appropriate rows will get
   extended to fit them:
  [[], [], [undef, undef, 0]]:  arrays can still be automatically extended by
   assigning to a value outside their currently-defined range.  Creating an
   array with the  methods does  prevent
   arrays from being extended nor prevent them from becoming non-rectangular.
   It is  necessary to pre-allocate a one-dimensional array of a
   specific size, as all arrays will automatically resize on assignment.
  
   If  is a function (it can be
   an Anonymous Function), then that
   function is called to provide the value for each cell.  The function must
   have the same number of arguments as the dimensions of the array, and it is
   passed the indices of the cell.  For example, element [0,0] of the array
   will be passed the arguments [0,0].
  
   The following makes a cell with each value initialized to twice its index.
  makeArray[[10], {|x| 2x}][0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
   A two-dimensional array requires a function with 2 arguments.  The
   following builds a multiplication table:
  makeArray[[5,5], {|a,b| a*b}][[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], [0, 3, 6, 9, 12], [0, 4, 8, 12, 16]]
   If the  function needs additional data, you can use
   the three-argument
   version makeArray[, , ]
   which passes an arbitrary  expression to
    as a last argument.  For example, the following
   creates a "diagonal" matrix with the specified values passed in as an array
   as the diagonal entries:
  
    array = [1,2,3]
    d = length[array]
    m = makeArray[[d,d], {|a,b,data| a==b ? data@a : 0}, array][[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]]It is very important to note that arrays are normally passed by
   reference.  This means that if you assign an array to another variable, and
   modify the second variable, then you are modifying the original!
  a = [3,2,1]
    b = a
    println[a]   // a is also sorted!
   To avoid this behavior, use the method
   .  This makes a shallow copy of the
   object.
  a = [3,2,1]
    b = a.shallowCopy[]
    println[a]   // a is now not sorted.
   Arrays can be automatically extended and used as a stack by using the
   methods:
   : Appends an item to the end
    of the array (top of stack).
    
    : Removes an item from the end of the
    array (top of stack) and returns it.
    
    : Returns the item from the end of
    the array (top of stack)  removing it from the
    array/stack.   If the array is empty, this will
    return .
    
    : returns  if the
    array is empty,  othewise.

    : pushes an item onto
    the  of an array.

    : removes an item from
    the  of an array and returns it.

    : pushes all the
    items from  onto the end of ,
    modifying it in-place.  You can also use
    the 
    function if you do not want to modify in-place.
  array = [1, 2]
    array.push[3]array = [1, 2, 3]
    c = array.pop[] now contains  now contains 
   Items can also be inserted or popped from the  of an array by
   using the methods  and
    methods.
  
   The contents of one array can be appended to another array using the
    method, which modifies the
   original array in place:
  
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = [4, 5, 6]
   You can also use
   the 
   function if you do not want to modify in-place.
  
   The dimensions of a possibly-multi-dimensional array can be obtained with
   the  method.  The arrays do not have
   to be rectangular; this returns the highest index of any sub-array.
    This may be a computationally-expensive call because it
   must traverse every element of every sub-array.  Do not use it repeatedly
   in a tight loop on large arrays.
  
   For example, the following array has 2 rows and 3 columns so it
   returns .
  
    a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    a.dimensions[]
   You can retrieve and set all of the values in a column of a 2-dimensional
   (or higher) array using the 
   and  functions, and in most cases, with
   the  and  methods of
   the  class.
  getColumn[, , ]From
      the two-dimensional (or higher) array , return column
      number  (0-indexed), or, if that column does not exist,
      create a new column with the same number of rows as the rest of the table
      where each value is .   The returned array is a
      one-dimensional array in row (not column) form so it can easily be passed
      to functions like .

    setColumn[, , ]Into
      the two-dimensional (or higher) array , set the
      one-dimensional array  (in row form) as column
      number  (0-indexed), replacing any data that may
      already be there.  If that column does not exist, create a new column in
      that place.
      
    insertColumn[, ,
      ]Inserts a column  column
      number  (0-indexed) in
      the two-dimensional (or higher) array, setting the values in the column
      to .  If inserting beyond the end of the table,
      multiple columns will be created if necessary.  This modifies the array
      in place.

    removeColumn[, ]From
      a two-dimensional (or higher) array, remove the column number specified
      by .  If this index does not exist, do nothing.  This
      modifies the array in place.
  
   The following are  on most implementations of
   the  class.  If these are not supported in some
   implementations of arrays, the functions above can be used instead.
  .getColumn[, ]From
      the two-dimensional (or higher) array, return column
      number  (0-indexed), or, if that column does not
      exist, create a new column with the same number of rows as the rest of
      the table where each value is .  The returned array
      is a one-dimensional array in row (not column) form so it can easily be
      passed to functions like .

    .setColumn[, ]Into
      the two-dimensional (or higher) array, set the one-dimensional
      array  (in row form) as column
      number  (0-indexed), replacing any data that may
      already be there.  If that column does not exist, create a new column in
      that place.

    .insertColumn[,
      ]Inserts a column  column
      number  (0-indexed) in
      the two-dimensional (or higher) array, setting the values in the column
      to .  If inserting beyond the end of the table,
      multiple columns will be created if necessary.  This modifies the array
      in place.

    .removeColumn[]From a
      two-dimensional (or higher) array, remove the column number specified
      by .  If this index does not exist, do nothing.  This
      modifies the array in place.
  
   Note that there not corresponding 
   and  operations because rows in a 2-dimensional array
   are already arrays and can be obtained with the 
   array-dereferencing operator.  For example, row 0 of the two-dimensional
   array  can be obtained and set with .
  
   The following example performs a spreadsheet-like operation of summing each
   of the columns of a two-dimensional array and appending the totals of each
   row in a new row.
  
    a = [[1,2,3],
         [3,4,5]]
    [rows, cols] = a.dimensions[]
    for colNum = 0 to cols-1
       col = a.getColumn[colNum, 0]
       col.push[sum]
    }
   You can concatenate two arrays (or
   other enumerating expressions) using
   the 
    function.  (Note that
   this is a , not a method on arrays!)  This returns a new
   array that is the concatenation of the elements of both arrays.  For now,
   the result is always an array, but this may change
   to be more memory-efficient by letting arbitrary enumerating expressions
   to follow each other.
  
   This does not do any deep copying of the elements.
  
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = [4, 5, 6]
    println[c]Items can be inserted into an array using the method
   .insert[, ].  This inserts
   the specified value  the item at the specified index.  If the
   index is greater than or equal to the size of the array, the array is
   extended to fit the new elements, setting any unspecified values to the
   undefined value .
  array = [0, 1, 2]
    array.insert[0, "first"] now contains 
   Items can be removed from an array using the method
   .  This removes the item with
   the specified index and returns it, so you can do something with the value
   if desired.  If the specified index does not exist, this generates an error.
  array = ["a", "b", "c"]
    n = array.remove[1] now contains 
   A range of values can be removed with the
    method which
   removes elements starting with index  (inclusive) and
   ending  index  (exclusive.)  The number of
   items that will be removed is .  The return value is
   the number of items that were actually removed.  (The end index is allowed
   to run off the end of the array.)
  array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    array.remove[2,4] now contains 
   Similarly, a range of values can be removed with the
   .removeLen[, ] method
   which removes elements starting with index  (inclusive)
   and removes  number of items.  The return value is the
   number of items that were actually removed (the length may run off the end
   of the array.)
  array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    array.removeLen[2,2] now contains 
   Items with a specified  can be removed from an array using
   the method .  This
   removes the first item having the specified  from the array.
   If a matching item is found, this returns , otherwise
   returns .
  array = ["one", "two", "three"]
   array.removeValue["two"] now contains 
   The  method removes
    elements in the array which have the specified value.
  array = [1,2,3,1]
    n = array.removeAll[1]
   A random item can be removed from an array using the method
   .  This removes a random item and
   returns its value.
  array = ["a", "b", "c"]
    n = array.removeRandom[]
   You can test if an item is contained in an array with the
    method:
  array = [1,2,3,1]
    n = array.contains[3]
   You can find the first indexes of items in an array with the methods:
  .indexOf[].indexOf[, ].lastIndexOf[].lastIndexOf[, ]
   If the item does not exist, these return .
  
   You can obtain all of the permutations of the array by using the
    method.  This returns an enumerating expression that
   lazily generates the permutations.  Note that the permutations are
   currently in reflected Gray code order, but this may change.
  
   The number of items returned will
   be  (which equals 
   in this case where all items are taken) where  is the length
   of the array.
  array = [1, 2, 3]
    array.permute[][[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [2, 1, 3]]
   If you need the results in lexicographical order, with duplicates removed,
   you can obtain all of the permutations of the array by using the
    method.
   This returns an enumerating expression that lazily generates the
   permutations.  Note that all of the elements of the array must be
    comparable to each other, a constraint which is not necessary in the
    method.
  array = [1, 2, 3]
    array.lexicographicPermute[][[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
   You can also specify an ordering function to be used by the
    method.  The function should take two
   arguments and return -1, 0, or 1 to indicate if item  is less
   than, equal to, or greater than item  respectively.  The
   following example sorts by length.
  
    array = ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
    f = {|a,b| length[a] <=> length[b]}
    array.lexicographicPermute[f]
    [[c, aa, bbb], [c, bbb, aa], [aa, c, bbb], [aa, bbb, c], [bbb, c, aa], [bbb, aa, c]]
    
   You can obtain all of the combinations of the array by using the
    method.  This returns an enumerating
   expression that lazily generates combinations.  Note that the combinations
   are currently in lexicographical order, (without duplicates removed,) but
   this may change.  For example, to take 3 items at a time from a list:
  array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    array.combinations[3][[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]]
   The number of combinations that will be generated
   is  where  is the number of
   items in the array and  is the number of items to take at
   a time.
  
   The sample program pokerhands.frink
   demonstrates using this method to enumerate all possible 5-card poker hands.
  
    a = new range[1, 10]
    println[first[a, 4]]
   The opposite of 
   is .  This returns
   everything  the first  elements in the list.
  
    a = new range[1, 10]
    println[rest[a, 4]]
   If you only want the first element as as single expression, you can
   use  .  This is like the
   ridiculously-named  function in other languages (whose name
   is a badly-chosen name from a 1950s-era computer.  Please stop using the
   names  and  in modern languages.)
  
   The opposite of 
   is .  This returns everything 
   the first element in the list.
  
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    println[first[a]]
   You can take the last items from an array (or any enumerating expression)
   using the  function.  This
   returns an array that returns the last  items and discards
   the rest.
  
    a = new range[1, 10]
    println[last[a, 5]]
   If you only want the last element as as single expression, you can
   use  .
  
   You can get an arbitrary "slice" out of an array using
   the  and
    functions.  (Note that these are functions, not
   methods.)
  
   The  function
   returns a slice of an array starting with index  and
   ending  index .  If the indices are beyond
   the ends of the array, only existing items will be returned.
  array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    slice[array, 1, 3]
   If  or  are the special value
   , then the slice will contain the start of the array
   or the end of the array respectively.
  
   The sliceLength[, , ]
   function returns a slice of an array starting with index 
   and containing  items.  If the indices are beyond the
   end of the array, only existing items will be returned.
  array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    sliceLength[array, 1, 3]
   The inverse of  and  are the
   functions  and  which
    the parts specified by the  commands and
   return the rest.
  
   The removeSlice[, , ]
   function removes array elements starting with index 
   and ending  index .  If the indices are
   beyond the ends of the array, only existing items will be removed.
   (Note that this is the inverse of what is returned by 
   with the same arguments.)
  
   If  or  are the special value
   , then the function will remove from the beginning of the
   array or to the end of the array respectively.
  array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    removeSlice[array, 1, 3]
   The removeSliceLength[, ,
    ] function removes a slice of an array starting with
   index  and containing  items.  If the
   indices are beyond the end of the array, only existing items will be
   removed.  (Note that this is the inverse of what is returned by
    with the same arguments.)
  array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    removeSliceLength[array, 1, 3]
   A list of lists can be flattened with the 
   function:
  
    a = [ [1,2], 3, [4, [5,6]] ]
    println[flatten[a]]
   To obtain all of the possible subsets of the elements in the array (this is
   also called the "power set",) you can use
   the  method.  This returns an
   enumerating expression which iterates through all the subsets of items in
   the array, including the empty set and the original set itself.  Each
   return value is itself an array of elements, with the elements preserving
   the same order as in the original array:
  
    a = [1,2,3]
    println[a.subsets[]]
    [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
   
   You can also request the subsets of the array and exclude either the empty
   set or the original set by using the
   .subsets[, ]
   method.  If  is , the empty set
   will be returned as one of the elements.  If , the empty
   set will be excluded. If  is
   , the full original set will be returned as one of the
   elements.  If , the full original set will be excluded,
   and only "proper" subsets will be returned.
  
    a = [1,2,3]
    println[a.subsets[false, false]]
    [[1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
   
   Note that output of the empty set and the original set are suppressed in
   the example above.
  
   The contents of an array can be shuffled randomly with the
    method (using the Fisher-Yates-Knuth
   algorithm):
  
   The contents of an array can be cleared with the
    method:
  
   While Frink does not have a complete implementation of matrix operations,
   (for an external class with some matrix operations, see Matrix.frink, and please
   contribute algorithms to that file,) it has some built-in methods that
   support matrix calculations.
  
   The  method transposes the
    elements of a 2-dimensional array, like in matrix calculations.  This
    means that rows and columns are switched.  In other words, the element at
     becomes the element at
    .
  
    array = [[1,2], [3, 4], [5,6]]
    array.transpose[]
   Since arrays are also enumerating
   expressions, any of
   the enumerating expression
   functions such as , , etc. will work
   on arrays.  Note that they are  that work on a
   variety of data types, and not methods on the array.  That is, you call
   them as  and
   .  See the following section
   for more information.
  
   Some functions can return a lazily-produced list of results.  These may be
   finite or infinite, and you often don't know in advance how long they will
   be, so the  function does not work on them.  Frink calls
   these "Enumerating Expressions".  For example, the
   function  returns an infinite list of prime numbers.
   Other enumerating expressions may be finite, such as the
   commonly-seen  notation, usually used in
   a  loop, which sequentially returns the integers from 1 to
   10.
  
   You usually don't want to print out all of the values of an enumerating
   expression directly (because they may be infinite), but rather use it in
   a  loop and handle each value individually.  After a value
   is returned from an enumerating expression, it is "forgotten", which helps
   reduce memory usage.
  
   It is important to note that many or most enumerating expressions are
   "use-once"; the values produced by the expression are only produced once.
   Even printing the values in Frink's interactive mode causes the values to
   be consumed.  If you need the values multiple times, it is beneficial to
   wrap them in something like a  call.
  
   You can test if an expression is an enumerating expression with
   the  function.  Note that many of
   Frink's data types are also enumerating expressions,
   including , ,
   , , , etc.,
   and will return  to this query.
  
   This is a partial list of functions that have special behavior that makes
   them useful for working with (possibly infinite) enumerating expression.
   Note that arrays are enumerating expressions, so all of these will work
   with arrays.
   returns the first element of an array
    or enumerating expression as a single expression.

    returns the
    first  elements of an array or enumerating expression.
    If the expression passed in is an array, the result is an array,
    otherwise it is a (possibly-infinite) enumerating expression.

    returns everything  the
    first element of an array or enumerating expression.  If the expression
    passed in is an array, the result is an array, otherwise it is a
    (possibly-infinite) enumerating expression.  This is the opposite of
     returns
    everything  the first  elements of an array
    or enumerating expression.  If the expression passed in is an array, the
    result is an array, otherwise it is a (possibly-infinite) enumerating
    expression.  This is the opposite of  returns the last element of an array
    or enumerating expression as a single expression.

    returns the
    last  elements of an array or enumerating expression.
    The result is an array.

    returns a
    slice of an array or enumerating expression starting with
    index  and ending 
    index .  If the indices are beyond the ends of the
    array, only existing items will be returned.  If 
    or  is the value , the results will
    include the beginning or end of the expression respectively.  If the
    expression passed in is an array, the result is an array, otherwise it
    is a (possibly-infinite) enumerating expression.

   sliceLength[, , ]
    returns a slice of an array or enumerating expression starting with
    index  and having  items.  If the
    expression passed in is an array, the result is an array, otherwise it
    is an enumerating expression.

    returns an enumerating
    expression which breaks  into a series of chunks of
    length , where each chunk is an array.

    
     For example, 
     returns an enumerating expression which produces:[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] returns an
    enumerating expression which breaks  into a series of
    chunks of length , advancing by 
    elements at each step, where each chunk is an array.
    
    
     For example, 
     returns an enumerating expression which produces:[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6]] returns the specified
    element of an array or enumerating expression, treating the first element
    as element 0.  This replaces the function called  (which
    is still available but deprecated.)

    returns the specified
    element of an array or enumerating expression, treating the first element
    as element 1.  For example, to return the millionth
    prime:   turns a finite enumerating expression
    into an array.

    counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns the count as a
    sorted array of  pairs with the most
    common items first.  This can be used to count letter frequencies
    (with ,) word frequencies
    (with ,) occurrences of repeated lines in 
    a file (with ,) etc.  See also
    the  function below.

    
     For example, counting the array 
     returns the array[[12, 3], [11, 2], [13, 1]] counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns the count as a
    dictionary where the key is the element and the value is the count.  See
    also the  function above.

    
     For example, counting the array
     returns the dictionary with mappings:[[12, 3], [11, 2], [13, 1]] counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns only the
    item(s) that occur the most commonly.  This returns  where  is an array of only the items which
    occur the most often and  is the number of their count.
    For more general counting, see the 
    and  functions above.

    
     For example, mostCommon[[1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4]]
      will return  as elements 1 and 4 both occur 3
      times.  If the input is empty, this returns 
     This can be used to find the  of a distribution (that is,
     similar to mean and median, the statistical definition of the 
     is the value(s) that occur the most times in a distribution.)
    modes[nums] := mostCommon[nums]@0
     modes[[1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4]] counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns only the
    item(s) that occur the least commonly.  This returns  where  is an array of only the items which
    occur the least often and  is the number of their count.
    For more general counting, see the 
    and  functions above.

    
     For example, leastCommon[[1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5]]
      will return  as elements 2 and 5 both occur 1
      time.  If the input is empty, this returns a =  [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5]
      [vals, count] = leastCommon[a]
         println["$v occurs $count times"]
      2 occurs 1 times
      5 occurs 1 times creates an
    infinte enumerating expression that
    counts up from the specified number, incrementing by 1 each time.  Note
    that this will produce infinite output if you even try to print it, so you
    probably want to call it from a  loop (perhaps with
    a  statement) or from something
    like  creates an
    infinte enumerating expression that
    counts from the specified number, adding  (which
    can be negative) each time.  Note
    that this will produce infinite output if you even try to print it, so you
    probably want to call it from a  loop (perhaps with
    a  statement) or from something
    like  returns  if all of
    the items in an EnumeratingExpression are all the same.  This
    returns  for an empty list.  If the argument is not an
    enumerating expression, this returns .
    
    Returns  if all
    of the items in an EnumeratingExpression are all different.  All items in
    the list must be HashingExpressions.  This returns  for
    an empty list.  If the argument is not an enumerating expression, this
    returns .

   
    Returns  if all of the items in the EnumeratingExpression
     are equal to . This
    returns  for an empty list.  If the argument is not an
    enumerating expression, this returns .
  
   An  is an array that is always kept in order.  Of
   course, this implies that all items in an  must be
   comparable with each other.  It extends the  class and
   almost all methods and functions that operate on  will
   work with , unless those methods would violate the
   ordering (e.g. ).
  
   By default, the ordering is the default ordering produced by the
   three-way
   comparison operator.  If another user-defined ordering is desired, it
   can be specified by one of the constructors explained in the next section.
  
   An  with the default ordering (that is, identical
   to the three-way
   comparison operator) can be created by
   calling :
  
   If you want to specify a user-defined ordering, you can pass a (possibly anonymous) function as the first argument to
   the constructor.  This function must take two arguments (we'll call them)
   , and return -1 if , 0 if
   , and 1 if .  (These are the values
   returned by
   the three-way
   comparison operator, so you may be able to use it in your comparison
   function.)
  
   For example, if you want to use an ordering that simply sorts shorter
   strings before longer strings, (say that six times speedily,) you can do the
   following:
  
    f = { |a,b|  length[a] <=> length[b] }
    x.insert["aa"]
    x.insert["z"]
   An OrderedList can also take a piece of arbitrary data that is passed to
   the comparison function.  This data is passed as the second argument to the
   constructor.  If the first argument to the constructor is
   , the default orderer will be used.  The data will be
   passed as a third argument to the comparison function.
  
    f = { |a,b,data|  (abs[a-data] <=> abs[b-data]}
    x = new OrderedList[f, 3] 
    x.insert[1]
    x.insert[3]
    x
   Since  extends , array methods are available on OrderedList unless
   they would interfere with preserving ordering.  New methods and methods
   with altered effects are listed below.
  Returns the index of the
      item to insert  to put the item in the right order.  If
      the item is found anywhere in the list, this returns the index of the
      matching item in the list.  If the item is not found in the list, this
      still returns the index before which it should be inserted.
      
    Returns true if the list
      contains 1 or more instances of the specified value, false if it does
      not.
      
    Returns the index of one of
      the occurrences of the specified value in the list, 
      if it does not occur.  If multiple instances of the same value occur in
      the list, this may return the index of any of the instances.
      
    Inserts the specified value
      into the appropriate place in the list.  If it's already there, this
      inserts a duplicate before the existing element.  (See the
       method if you don't want duplicates.) Returns
      the index where the item was inserted, but this behavior may change.

    Inserts the specified
      value into the appropriate place in the list.  If it's already there, a
      new value is not added.  Returns the index where the item was inserted,
      but this behavior may change.
      
    
      in OrderedList as it could violate proper ordering.
      
    Inserts all of the elements
      of the specified expression (which can be an array or
      enumerating expression) into this OrderedList, with the correct ordering.
      If duplicates exist, duplicates will be inserted.
      
    Inserts all of the
      elements of the specified expression (which can be an array or
      enumerating expression) into this OrderedList, with the correct ordering.
      No duplicates will be allowed.

     in
      OrderedList as it could violate proper ordering.
      
     in
      OrderedList as it could violate proper ordering.

     in
      OrderedList as it could violate proper ordering.
      
    This differs from the behavior of
       in that it does not modify the
      structure in place, but rather returns a new (unordered)
       which is shuffled randomly.
  
   A  is a type of array, but with a fixed maximum
   size.  It is efficient to append items to the end of the list using the
    method, and to remove them from the beginning
   using the , which is how it will usually
   be used.  If more items are pushed than the fixed capacity allows, the item
   at the front of the buffer is discarded.
  
   Items can also be accessed randomly using the array index 
   operator.  The first item is always element 0.  When an item is popped from
   the beginning of the list using the  method, the
   item that was previously at index 1 becomes index 0, and so on.  If you
   attempt to access an item that does not exist, this raises an error, but
   this behavior may change.
  
   A  is constructed by specifying its size as a
   positive integer:
  
   Like other Frink collections, you can find out how many items are contained
   with the  function.  You can also turn it
   into a traditional array with the 
   function.  Its elements can be enumerated with a  loop.
  
   The following demonstrates using a RingBuffer to capture the last
    elements of an enumerating expression (this could be a list,
   or the lines of a file from the  function, etc.)
  
    last[expr, n]:=
    {
       b.pushAll[expr]
    }
   
   The following methods operate on .  They are mostly
   the same as the corresponding array methods,
   with differences as noted below:
  Pushes the specified expression
      onto the end of the list.  If the  is at
      capacity, this will throw away the item at the beginning and change the
      indices of the array.  The first element is always element 0 of the list.
      
    Pushes the specified
      expression to the beginning of the list.  If the 
      is at capacity, this will throw away the item at the end.  The new
      element becomes element 0 of the list.

    Removes the last element from the list and
      returns its value.  If the list is empty, this currently throws an error
      but this behavior may change.

    Removes the first element from the list
      and returns its value.  This will change the indices for the remaining
      items.   If the list is empty, this currently throws an error
      but this behavior may change.

    Pushes all the elements
      in the specified collection (which can be an enumerating expression,)
      individually, onto the end of the list.  If the collection is an array
      with known length, this is done efficiently.

    Returns true if the
       is empty, false otherwise.
      
    Returns true if the
       is full, false otherwise.

    Returns true if the given
      expression is contained in the list.  This is a linear search.

    Returns the index of the first
      occurrence of the specified expression in the list,  if
      it does not exist in the list.

    Returns the
      index of the first occurrence of the specified expression in the list,
      beginning the search at index .  This returns
       if it does not exist at that point or later in the list.
      
    Returns the index of the
      last occurrence of the specified expression in the list, 
      if it does not exist in the list.

    lastIndexOf[, ]Returns
      the index of the last occurrence of the specified expression in the list,
      beginning the search at index .  This returns
       if it does not exist at that point or earlier in the
      list.
  
   You can request input from the user with the
    or
   input[, ] function.
   The result always comes back as a string, but you can parse it into a unit,
   a date, or whatever, using the  function:
  radius = input["Enter the radius of a sphere: "]volume = 4/3 pi eval[radius]^3
   This allows your users to enter things like "3 inches" or "1 mile" or any
   units that Frink knows about (like "earthradius",) and everything will Just
   Work.  (That "Self-Evaluation" section above seemed irrelevant at the time,
   but it turns out it's quite useful.)
  
   If the user cancels the input dialog, or, for text input, if end-of-file is
   reached, this returns the special value .
  
   In command-line mode, these  functions also allow you to
   read from standard input (stdin).  (User input is actually taken from stdin
   in command-line mode, as you may expect.)  Lines can be read one at a time,
   and have trailing carriage returns/linefeeds removed.  On
   end-of-file (EOF), the input function returns the special value
   .  A short-program to read from standard in and echo its
   output may look like:
  while (line = input[""]) != undef
       println[line]
   
   If, for some reason, you're in a GUI mode and you still want to read from
   standard input, you can call  to read one line
   from standard input.  This is just like calling  from
   command-line mode, which is what you really want to be calling if you're
   trying to make programs that work both interactively and non-interactively,
   and in GUI mode and non-GUI mode.  But if you're sure you only ever want to
   read from standard input, and don't want to trigger a GUI input window, use
   while (line = readStdin[]) != undef
       println[line]
   
   If you want to request multiple input items from the user, you can use the
   "multi-input" version of the input function, where the second argument is an
   array of items you're going to prompt for:
  [first, last] = input["What is your name", ["First Name", "Last Name"]]
   This will produce a graphical user interface which prompts the user for
   their input.  This works on AWT, Swing, Android, and in text mode if you're
   running in a pure text environment.
  
   The results will be returned as an array of strings, in the same order as
   they were specified.  As in the Input section above,
   you can use the  function to parse them into
   numeric or other values.
  
   If the user cancels the input dialog, or, for text input, if end-of-file is
   reached, this returns the special value  instead of an
   array.  When in text mode, if end-of-file is reached before filling the
   second or later item, then partial results will be returned (with the
   special value  being returned for each incomplete value.)
  
   If any of the items in the array is a two-element array, the second
   argument will be used as the default value:
  [first, last] = input["What is your name",[["First
    Name", "Jeff"], ["Last Name", "Albertson"]]]
   The following program demonstrates an idiom for creating a simple
   interactive GUI that finds roots of numbers until you cancel.  The
    loop exits when the user cancels calculations.  Previous
   results are displayed to the user at the top of the input dialog, and the
   user's previous input is maintained (verbatim) in the input fields.
  
    n = "10000"
    r = "2"
    message = "Find roots of a number"
    while [n, r] = results = input[message, [["Number", n], ["Root", r]]]
       [num, root] = eval[results]  
       val = num^(1/root)
       message = "$n^(1/$r) = $val"
       println[message]
   This code works whether the user is running with a Swing or AWT or Android
   GUI, or in text mode.  The user cancels input by closing the input dialog
   (in Swing or AWT), hitting the "back" button on Android, or with
   end-of-file (EOF) in text mode (EOF can be simulated by Control-D on
   Unixlike systems, Control-Z on Windows.)
  
   Note that the idiomatic use of the "eval" function to turn the string
   inputs into Frink expressions.  This means that the user can enter any
   expression that Frink understands, such as "", "", "" or "".  It's like a generalized calculator inside of a specialized
   calculator!
  
   To print, use the  or  functions,
   each of which take one argument.  The only difference is that
    sends a linefeed afterwards.
  println["The volume of the sphere is " + (volume ->
    ft^3) + " cubic feet."]
   I'm just going to list a forest of cryptic boolean expressions here without
   explanation.  You pick out the ones you like.  They all work, and there are
   usually multiple equivalents for the same thing, taken from different
   languages.  I've tried to keep precedence the same as Java.  There is no
   difference between the different versions of, say,
   , ,
   and  .
  
    true TRUE false FALSE == != <> < <= > >= && and
    AND || or OR ! NOT not nand NAND nor NOR xor XOR implies IMPLIES
   
   The three-way comparison operator, , also called the
   "spaceship" operator, compares two arguments and returns their relative
   ordering:
  
   For , this returns:
  
   These are the values expected by ordering functions, such as those used in
   user-defined sorting.
  
   A dictionary is an associative data structure that lets you map arbitrary
   keys to values (currently, keys can be strings, units, (that is, numbers),
   sets, other dictionaries, arrays, date/time values, or
   objects created from a .)
  
   The syntax is identical to the syntax for array element manipulation.  (This
   means that you can switch back and forth between an array and (sparse)
   dictionary representation for integer-indexed data structures!)
  
   Create an empty dictionary using 
    a@"one" = 1
    a@"two" = 2
    b@1 = "one"
    b@2 = "two"
   You can also enumerate over  pairs directly in a
   dictionary.  They are not returned in any guaranteed order.
  for [key, value] = a
       println["$key = $value"]
   Create an empty dictionary:
  
   Create a dictionary from an array (or enumerating expression) where each
   element in the array is a two-item list which are treated as a key and a
   value:
  
    array = [["one", 1], ["two", 2]]  
    d = new dict[array] 
    d@"one"  
   You can also turn an array (or other types) into a dictionary by calling
   the  function on it, which behaves exactly
   like calling the single-argument constructor above.
  
   Create a dictionary from two arrays (or enumerating expressions) where the
   first array contains keys and the second array contains values.  The first
   element in the keys array will be matched with the first element in the
   values array.
  
    keys = ["one", "two"]
    values = [1,2]
    d = new dict[keys, values]
    d@"one"
   You can get an enumeration of the keys in a dictionary by using the
    method.  This method does not return the keys in any
   defined order, but you can sort them with the sorting
    functions below.
  for key = a.keys[]
       println[ "$key = " + a@key]
   The following enumerates through key, value pairs sorted by key.  This
   works because the  function works by coercing
   an enumerating expression (of
   which  is one) into an array
   of  pairs and sorting by column 0
   which is the key:
  for [key, val] = sort[a, byColumn[0]]
       println["$key = $val"]
   You can get an enumeration of the values in a dictionary by using the
    method.  This method does not return the keys in any
   defined order, but you can sort them with the sorting
    functions below.
  println[join[", ", a.values[]]
   The following enumerates through key, value pairs sorted by key.  This
   works because the  function works by coercing
   an enumerating expression (of
   which  is one) into an array
   of  pairs and sorting by column 1
   which is the key:
  for [key, val] = sort[a, byColumn[1]]
       println["$key = $val"]
   The syntax  looks up the value of an
   dictionary corresponding to a specific key and returns it
   or the special value  if the dictionary does not contain
   that key.  The method .get[,
   altValue=undef] can be used to look up the value corresponding to
   the key or return the alternate value  if the
   dictionary does not contain that key.
  
   A dictionary can be queried to see if it contains a specific key using the
    method:
  
   Entries in a dictionary can be removed with the
    method.  This returns the value
   corresponding to the key, or the special value  if that
   key is not in the dictionary.
  
   You can invert the contents of a dictionary by using the
    method which returns a new dictionary with key-value
   pairs reversed.  If the values are not hashable, this will print a
   warning.  If the same value appears multiple times, this will print a
   warning.
  [[one, 1], [two, 2], [three, 3]]
   A dictionary can be cleared by using the  method:
  
    A dictionary is often used to count occurrences of an item.  The
    methods 
    and  method increments
    the value corresponding to the specified key by the specified count (in
    the first method, it increments by 1.)  It returns the new total.
  
    d=new dict
    d.increment["a", 1]
    d.increment["b", 1]
   A dictionary is often used to store a list of occurrences corresponding to
   the specified key.  The
   functions 
   or  pushes the specified
   value onto the list or set corresponding to the key and returns the new
   list or set.
  
    d=new dict
    d.addToList["a", 1]
    d.addToList["b", 3]
    d=new dict
    d.addToSet["a", 1]
    d.addToSet["b", 3]
   A set is a data structure that contains items with no duplicates.  A set
   can currently contain strings, units, (that is, numbers),
   other sets, dictionaries, arrays, date/time values, or
   objects created from a .
  
   You simply create an empty set using , a literal set by
   calling something like , or turn an array or
   enumerating expression into a set by calling
   .

  
   Note that sets
   do not preserve any order of the items contained in them.  There are a
   variety of methods for modifying sets:
  
   Items are inserted into a set using the  method:
  
   Multiple items from an array, set, or other enumerating expression can be
   inserted into a set as separate items using the  method: 
  
    b = new set
    c = [1,2,3]
   Items are removed from a set using the  method:
  
   A set can be tested to see if it contains a value by using the
    method:
  
   You can get a shallow copy of a set by calling its
    method.
  
    b = a.shallowCopy[]
    b.put[2]
   You can make a shallow copy of a set and then add or remove an item from
   the set using its 
   and methods.  These are often
   useful in recursive routines.
  
   A set can be cleared by using the  method:
  
   You can also enumerate over values contained in a set:
  for value = a
       println[value]
   The following demonstrates turning an enumerating expression into a set (the
    function returns an enumerating expression
   of all of the lines in a file,) turning that into an set (to remove
   duplicates) and sorting it (implicitly turning it into an array in the
   process.) The result is a sorted array containing all of the unique lines
   in a file, discarding duplicates.
  
    sort[toSet[lines["file:myfile.txt"]]]
   
   To obtain all of the possible subsets of the elements in the set, you
   can use the  method.  This returns an
   enumerating expression which iterates through allt he subsets of items in
   the set, including the empty set and the original set itself.  Each
   return value is itself an set of elements.
  
    a = new set[1,2,3]
    println[a.subsets[]]
    [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
   
   You can also request the subsets of the set and exclude either the empty
   set or the original set by using the
   .subsets[, ]
   method.  If  is , the empty set
   will be returned as one of the elements.  If , the empty
   set will be excluded. If  is
   , the full original set will be returned as one of the
   elements.  If , the full original set will be excluded,
   and only "proper" subsets will be returned.
  
    a = [1,2,3]
    println[a.subsets[false, false]]
    [[1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
   
   Note that output of the empty set and the original set are suppressed in
   the example above.
  
   The following functions operate on sets:
  Returns a new set whose
      value is the union of sets  and .
      (Sometimes written .) In other
      words, the new set contains all of the elements that exist in
       set  set .

    Returns a new set
      whose value is the intersection of sets  and
      . (Sometimes written .)
      In other words, the new set contains only the elements
      that exist in  set  set
      .

    Returns true if
      the two sets have a non-empty intersection.  That is, both sets contain
      at least one element in common.
      
    Returns a new set
      whose value is the difference of sets  and
      . (Sometimes written  or
      .) 
      In other words, the new set contains only the elements
      that exist in set  in set
      .  If the arguments are not sets, this tries to coerce the
      arguments into sets, so it can be used to get the differences of arrays
      as sets, for instance.  Note that ordering will be lost when
      differencing arrays.

    Returns a
      new set whose value is the "symmetric difference", also known as the
      "disjunctive union" of sets  and
      .  In other words, the new set contains only the elements
      that are in either set  or 
      in both.  For example, the symmetric difference of the sets {1,2,3} and
      {3,4} is {1,2,4}.  If the arguments are not sets, this tries to coerce
      the arguments into sets, so it can be used to get the differences of
      arrays as sets, for instance.  Note that ordering will be lost when
      differencing arrays.

    Returns true if
      sets  is a subset of set . (Sometimes
      written .)  In other words, this returns true if
      all of the elements in set  are also contained in set
      .  Note that this does not test that this is a
       "proper" subset.  See below.

    Returns true if
      sets  is a  subset of set
      . (Sometimes written .)  In other
      words, this returns true if  all of the elements in set 
      are also contained in set  set 
      also has fewer members than b.
      
    Turns the specified expression into
      a set, if possible. This works with enumerating expressions, arrays, or
      simple expressions (making a single-item set out of the latter.)
      
    Returns the cardinality of the
      set, that is, the number of items it contains.
  
   The most common trigonometric functions are built in.  They, as everything
   else in Frink, are best used when you explicitly specify the units.  For
   the following functions, input should be an angle, and output will come out
   dimensionless.  (If no unit is specified for input, it should act like
   radians, because radians  dimensionless units and really
   indistinguishable from pure numbers.)
  
   For inverse operations, the input must be dimensionless, and the output
   will come out in angular units.  (Radians, by default.)  This is easily
   converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You don't see that
   the output is in radians because radians are essentially dimensionless
   numbers.  You just gotta be a bit careful with angles.
  arctan[3 inches/(1 foot)] -> arcminutes
   (Returns a value in the range [-π/2, π/2])arctan[3 inches, 1 foot] -> degrees
   (Calculates  corrected for the proper quadrant.
   Returns a value in the range [-π, π])
   The following functions can be used to format numeric and unit expressions
   to a variety of formats.
   the  operator is a formatting operator
   that , so you can't format it any
   further.
  
    a = 10 USD -> Euro   
    format[a, "Euro", 2] 
   This is right, and only converts and formats on output, which is
   usually what you want to do:
    a = 10 USD
    format[a, "Euro", 2]
   
   In the following functions, the value can be number with units of measure,
    or any enumerating expression
    (array, set, OrderedList, etc.) with numerical values.  If the value is
    an array or other collection, these functions return an array of
    strings, which can then be formatted using other functions
    like , , etc.
  format[value, divideBy, decPlaces]formatFix[value, divideBy, decPlaces]formatFixed[value, divideBy, decPlaces]Fixed-decimal-places format:  Divides
       by  and returns a string with a
       fixed number () of digits  the
       decimal point.  If the value is
       an array or other collection, these functions return an array of
       strings, which can then be formatted using other functions
       like , , etc.  If the number is
       dimensionless without size,  should be
      . For example:
      
      format[3 meters, feet, 2]a = [[1/2, 1/3], [1/6, 1/7]]
        joinln[format[a, 1, 5]][0.50000, 0.33333][0.16667, 0.14286]If  is a string, this evaluates the string,
       expecting a unit to be returned, and both divides by this unit and
       concatenates the string after the result:
      format[3 meters, "feet", 2] This function is somewhat deprecated for several
       reasons:
      It requires additional work behind the scenes which makes it
        slower.  (That is, it needs to predict how many digits will be
        in the result after division, and then has to increase its working
        precision to calculate the full number of digits after the decimal
        point.)
       It is not a very readable representation for very large or very
        small numbers.
       It loses information for small numbers (less-significant digits
        may be lost or rounded or the number may be lost entirely.)
       It is rarely a good choice for large numbers, as many of the
        decimal places will be meaningless or displayed as zero.
       It's not quite as flexible as the other functions. It will not work
        if its arguments are not real numbers ( complex numbers or
        intervals.  The other formatting functions  work in this
        case.)
      
       The previous behavior of the  function was preserved
       to keep old programs working, but the default behavior of
        change in the future to another one of
       the formatting functions below.  The  and
        functions (which are identical to each other)
       will keep their current behavior, so it's probably better to use
        instead of  to future-proof
       your programs if this is the behavior your want to keep.
      formatSci[value, divideBy, decPlaces]Scientific
       Notation:   Divides
       by  and returns a string in
      scientific notation with  decimal
      digits.  (If the value is dimensionless without size,
       should be ). For example:
      
      If  is a string, this evaluates the string,
       expecting a unit to be returned, and both divides by this unit and
       concatenates the string after the result:
      formatSci[1 mm, "feet", 4]formatSig[value, divideBy, decPlaces]Significant
       Figures format:  Divides
       by  and returns a string
      with  significant digits.  This may be a normal
      number or a number in scientific format, depending on the size of the
      number.  (If the number is dimensionless without size,
       should be ). For example:
      
      formatSig[100 mm, feet, 2]If  is a string, this evaluates the string,
       expecting a unit to be returned, and both divides by this unit and
       concatenates the string after the result:
      formatSig[100 mm, "feet", 3]formatEng[value, divideBy, decPlaces]Engineering
       format: Divides
       by  and returns a string in
      "engineering" format (that is, in scientific mode or normal mode where
      exponents are a multiple of 3,) so that they can be easily read as
       milli-, kilo-, mega-, etc. with  significant
      digits.  (If the number is dimensionless without size,
       should be ). For example:
      
      formatEng[1000 miles, m, 4]If  is a string, this evaluates the string,
       expecting a unit to be returned, and both divides by this unit and
       concatenates the string after the result:
      formatEng[29000 feet, "meters", 4]
   The following compares the output of the various formatting functions by
   displaying  for various integer values of
   .
  
   Two-dimensional (and higher) arrays can be easily formatted into a table
   form.  This is more flexible and space-efficient than, say, trying to
   format with tab characters.  Each cell is allowed to contain embedded
   newline characters making this especially flexible.
  formatTable[, ="center", ="center", ="", ="
     "], ="center", ="center", ="", =" "]
    The  and 
     functions will format a two-dimensional (or higher) array as a
     two-dimensional table.  It will also format a one-dimensional array into
     a column.  The difference is that 
     returns the result as a single string with embedded newlines
     and  returns an array of strings with no
     newlines so you can layout and compose more complicated layouts.

     
      Formats the specified 2-dimensional or higher array as a table, using
      the specified alignment within each cell and optional separators.
     : The horizontal alignment within the
     cell.  This must be one of the
     strings , ,
     or  (the default.)
     :  The vertical alignment within the cell.
     This is only applied if the table cell contains multiple lines.  This
     must be one of the strings , ,
     or  (the default.)
     :  An optional character to draw optional horizontal
     lines separating cells.  This should be a one-character string.  If this
     is the empty string  (the default,) no horizontal lines
     are drawn separating cells.  A good suggestion is ,
     the Unicode horizontal line box drawing character.
     :  The string that will be used to separate columns
     from each other.  The default is a single space, .
     This string can be of arbitrary length.

     that this function currently does not have horizontal spacing for
     multi-line arrays.  (This is because it is primarily used
     by formatEquation.frink
     to format array arguments and which demonstrates more formatting of
     expressions using these functions.)  Also note that brackets are smaller

     Turns a
      one-dimensional array (or enumerating
      expression) into a two-dimensional array with 
      number of columns.  This can be used with the table formatting functions
      above to pretty-print a large array in columns for display.  For
      example, the following prints the first 25 prime numbers in 5 columns:
      
     formatTable[columnize[first[primes[], 25], 5], "right"]
 2  3  5  7 11
13 17 19 23 29
53 59 61 67 71

     To make the values in the table increase top-to-bottom then
     left-to-right, call the  method on the output
     of :
     formatTable[columnize[first[primes[], 25], 5].transpose[], "right"]
 2 13 31 53 73
 3 17 37 59 79
 7 23 43 67 89
   For example, to format a simple multiplication table:
  a = new array[[10,10],{|a,b| (a+1)*(b+1)}]
    println[formatTable[a, "right"]]
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18  20
 3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27  30
 4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36  40
 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45  50
 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54  60
 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63  70
 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72  80
 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81  90
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
   This can be combined with the formatting functions to, say, format a table
   of numbers to 5 significant digits:
  c = makeArray[[5,5], {|a,b| randomFloat[a,b]}]
    println[formatTable[formatSig[c,1,5]]]0.0000  0.70580 0.56481 6.0658e-2 0.95933
0.62126 1.0000  1.0118   2.7759   1.7738 
1.0864  1.2141  2.0000   2.3813   3.3547 
2.9476  1.6989  2.8562   3.0000   3.6287 
0.95502 3.2701  2.6403   3.3168   4.0000 
   Or, with , the table can be drawn with Unicode

   require your environment to be configured for Unicode output.

   If passed a one-dimensional array,  will format it
   into column form, with optional alignment.

   These formatting functions can work with multi-line strings, and as a
   result, they can be called recursively to typeset equations.  This is quite
   powerful.  See the sample
   program, formatEquation.frink,
   which demonstrates more formatting of expressions using these functions.
  symbolicMode[true]
    b = noEval[1/2 F freq^-1 pi^-1 v^-1]

   Similarly, it can be used to format tables in Frink source code.
  
    c = new array[[4,4], {|a,b| (a+1)*(b+1)}]
    d  = formatTableInput[c, "right"]
    println[formatTable[[["c =", d]], "right", "top"]]
   c = [[1, 2,  3,  4],

    Negates a number (that is, multiplies it
      by -1) while preserving precision.
  
   Some functions for number theory and factorization are available.
   If you're doing number-theoretical work with very large
   integers, please see the Performance Tips
   section of the documentation for ways to greatly improve integer
   performance.
  Returns the number of bits in
      the minimal two's-complement representation of an integer,
       a sign bit.  In other words, this returns the index
      of the highest bit that differs from the sign bit.
      
    Returns an
      integer, either 0 or 1, indicating the value of the specified bit in an
      integer.  Bit 0 is the least-significant bit.  The number is treated as
      a two's-complement representation with infinite length.  That is, the
      high bits on a negative number will always be 1, and the high bits on a
      positive number or zero will always be 0.

    Returns a
      boolean value, either false for 0 or true for 1, indicating the value of
      the specified bit in an integer.  Bit 0 is the least-significant bit.
      The number is treated as a two's-complement representation with infinite
      length.  That is, the high bits on a negative number will always be true,
      and the high bits on a positive number or zero will always be false.
      
    Returns the index of
      the rightmost (lowest-order) one bit in an integer (the number of
      zero bits to the right of the rightmost one bit). Returns -1 if the
      integer contains no one bits.

    Shifts the bits
      of an integer left by the specified number of bits.  New bits will
      contain zero.  This is equivalent to multiplying by 2 but
      is usually more efficient.

    Shifts the bits
      of an integer right by the specified number of bits, losing the bits
      pushed off the right side.  This is equivalent to performing a
       by 2 but is usually more efficient.
      
    Returns the bitwise
       of two integers, treated as two's complement numbers
      with infinite sign bits.
      
    Returns the bitwise
       of two integers, treated as two's complement numbers
      with infinite sign bits.
      
    Returns the bitwise
       (exclusive-or) of two integers, treated as two's
      complement numbers with infinite sign bits.
      
    Returns the bitwise
       of an integer, treated as a two's complement number with
      infinite sign bits.  This means that performing a  on
      a positive number will return a negative number, and vice-versa.  This
      may be unexpected if you're unfamiliar with two's complement notation,
      but functions like  and
       will do the right thing, and will
      handle all leading sign bits correctly without you needing to specify
      the length of your numbers.  Please look up two's complement
      number representation if you're unfamiliar with this.
      
    Returns the bitwise
       (an AND followed by a NOT) of two integers, treated as
      two's complement numbers with infinite sign bits.  See notes about
       above.
      
    Returns the
      bitwise  (an OR followed by a NOT) of two integers,
      treated as two's complement numbers with infinite sign bits.  See notes
      about  above.

    Sets the
      specified bit of a number (least significant bit is 0) to 1 and returns
      a new number. This is equivalent to
      bitOr[, shiftLeft[1, ]].
       is treated as a two's complement number with infinite
      sign bits.  See notes about  above.
      
    Clears the
      specified bit of a number (least significant bit is 0) to 0 and returns
      a new number. This is equivalent to
      bitAnd[, bitNot[shiftLeft[1, ]]].
       is treated as a two's complement number with infinite
      sign bits.  See notes about  above.
      
    Flips the
      specified bit of a number (least significant bit is 0) and returns
      a new number. This is equivalent to
      bitXor[, shiftLeft[1, ]].
       is treated as a two's complement number with infinite
      sign bits.  See notes about  above.
      
    rotateLeft[, , ]Rotates
      the bits of an integer  left by  bits,
      treating the number as  (e.g. 32 is common) bits
      wide.
      
    rotateRight[, , ]Rotates
      the bits of an integer  right by  bits,
      treating the number as  (e.g. 32 is common) bits
      wide.
      
    Returns the greatest
      common divisor of the integers  and .

    Returns the least
      common multiple of the integers  and .

    Returns false if the integer
       is composite, true if the number is prime (or probably
      prime.)  This test uses trial division and then Rabin-Miller strong
      pseudoprime tests to determine primality.  The bases used in the
      Rabin-Miller test are known to  primality for numbers
      smaller than 3,317,044,064,679,887,385,961,981, (see Sorenson and Webster) but for larger numbers
      this function can erroneously declare a composite number to be prime.
      (If it returns false, the number is definitely composite.)
      
      
       If the number is larger than this, the test is performed against 78
       random prime bases.  This gives a  small probability of
       about 1 in 10 that the function may return
        for a composite number.  (And that's a worst-case;
       for randomly-chosen large numbers, the probability of error is actually
       far, far lower for most numbers, especially big ones.  The above
       assumes the ridiculously low estimate that the pseudoprime test fails
       1/4 of the time.  The reality is orders of magnitude lower.  For better
       estimates, see Probable primes: How Probable?)
      
       It is more likely that any of the following will happen:
      You cut-and-pasted the wrong number to be tested, maybe missing one
        digit.  (In my experience in prime number groups, this is  the most likely source of error.)
        
       Your hardware will fail and return the wrong answer (perhaps due to
        a cosmic ray hitting it.)

       You'll flip a coin 156 times in a row and it will land on "heads"
        every time.

       You'll play roulette and your number will get picked 29 times in a
        row.

       You'll test a trillion numbers every second for the known lifetime
        of the universe and you'll still only have a miniscule 1 in
        10 chance of getting a single wrong answer.
      
       And these are ridiculously generous estimates.  The actual probability
       of failure is usually astronomically lower than this.
      
       As of the 2005-11-13 release,  was
       extended to automatically use a faster Lucas-Lehmer test if  is
       of the form 2-1 ( Mersenne numbers).  Note that
       the Lucas-Lehmer test is sufficient to  primality for
       numbers of this form, regardless of their size.
      
       Also note that  will return .
       This simplifies recursive factor-finding algorithms, but I know it may
       not match the modern definition of primes.  This behavior may change,
       so try not to rely on it.
      Returns the prime factors of an
      integer  as a two-dimensional list.  This uses trial
      division, then the Pollard  method, and then the Pollard Rho
      method to find factors.  The factor list consists of a list of pairs of
      prime factors and the exponent of each factor:

      
       This indicates that the prime factors of 1000 are 2 *
       5.
      Returns the prime factors of an
      integer  as a one-dimensional list.  This uses trial
      division, then the Pollard  method, and then the Pollard Rho
      method to find factors.  The factor list consists of a list of prime
      factors, each possibly repeated.  This performs identically to the
       function above; the output format is just
      different.

      allFactors[, ,
      , , ]Returns  factors
      of the integer , .  The
      optional arguments  and 
      indicate if the numbers 1 and n are to be included in the results.  If
      the optional argument  is true, the results will be
      sorted. If the optional argument =true, then only
      the factors less than or equal to the square root of the number will be
      produced.  It currently returns an array, but that may change to an
      enumerating expression someday to be more memory-efficient for numbers
      with huge amounts of factors.
      
    Returns the Jacobi symbol
      (often written as (a/n) ) of the integers  and
      .   must be a positive, odd integer.  This
      function is used in factorization and primality testing.  The Jacobi
      symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol, so it can be used to
      calculate the Legendre symbol of two numbers.  (The Legendre symbol is
      only defined if  is prime.)

    isStrongPseudoprime[, ]
      Returns true if  is a strong pseudoprime to base
      .  If this returns false, the number is definitely
      composite.  If it returns true, the number  be prime.  This
      does  prove that a number is actually prime, as
      numbers can fail this test for up to 1/4 of bases.  This can be used as a
      component of a prime sieving algorithm (but be sure to do things like
      verify that the number is odd first!)

      
       The argument  can also be an array of integers, in
       which case all of the bases are tested, bailing out when the number is
       known to be composite.  This may be slightly faster (and easier to
       code) in some cases.  You may be able to use this along
       with minimal sets of bases (link opens in new window) to
       make an even faster primality test.

      
       While the above paragraph correctly states that this test can fail for
        1/4 of bases, the actual failure rate for larger numbers
       is many orders of magnitude smaller than that!  See Probable primes: How Probable? (link opens in new
       window) for an estimate of how much lower the failure rate becomes.

    Returns the next
      prime number .  The value of
       may be any real number.  This method uses a wheel
      factoring method to completely avoid testing composite numbers with
      small factors.

    Returns the
      previous prime number .  The value
      of  may be any real number.  If  is smaller
      than 2, this returns .  This method uses a wheel
      factoring method to completely avoid testing composite numbers with
      small factors.

    Returns an infinite
      enumerating expression that lists
      all of the prime numbers in ascending order.  Note that this will
      produce infinite output if you even try to print it, so you probably
      want to call it from a  loop or from something
      like Returns an
      infinite enumerating expression
      that lists all of the prime numbers greater than or equal
      to  in ascending order.  Note that this will produce
      infinite output if you even try to print it, so you probably want to
      call it from a  loop or from something
      like Returns
      a finite enumerating expression
      that lists all of the prime numbers greater than or equal
      to  and less than or equal to .
      If  is , the enumeration begins with
      2.  If  is , the enumeration is
      potentially infinite.
      
    Returns the nth
      prime number (indexed with 1, that is,  returns
      2 and  returns 3.)
        
    Returns the
      number of ways that the integer n can be partitioned.  This uses Euler's
      pentagonal number algorithm to find the partition count somewhat
      efficiently, and caches the results so subsequent calls to this function
      will be efficient.

    Returns an
      enumeration of the partitions of the integer n.  For example:

      
        for a = partitions[4]
           println[a]
        [4]
        [3, 1]
        [2, 1, 1]partitionsCompact[,
       ]Like the
       
      function above, but returns a more compact enumeration of the partitions
      of the integer n.  Each list contains [num, count] pairs indicating the
      number and its count in a partition.  For example, compare the following
      representation with the one from the  function
      above.

      
        for a = partitionsCompact[4]
           println[a]
        [[4, 1]]
        [[3, 1], [1, 1]]
        [[2, 1], [1, 2]]
       If the optional argument  is
       , then each element also contains the number of
       possible permutations of the list.
      
        for a = partitionsCompact[4, true]
           println[a]
        [[[4, 1]], 1]
[[[3, 1], [1, 1]], 2]
[[[2, 1], [1, 2]], 3]Returns the
     binomial coefficient.  This is of the number of ways 
     things can be chosen  at a time, with order being
     unimportant.  This is sometimes called "m choose n" or "m C n".  This is
     equivalent to  although calculating that way
     often leads to way-too-big numbers.  For example, binomial[10000,
     9998] is equal to 49995000, but if you calculated it naively,
     you'd have to calculate 10000! which is a 35660-digit number, and divide
      it by another huge number, which could be inefficient and slow.
      
       This will give the number of items returned by the
       the 
       method where  is the length of the array
       and  is the number of items to take.

      
       See the sample
       program Pochhammer.frink
       for generalizations of the binomial function to non-integer types.
      Returns
     the number of permutations of  things being
     taken  at a time, with order being important. This is
     sometimes called "mPn".  This is equivalent to 
     but calculated efficiently by calling 
     internally.
      
       This will give the number of items returned by the
       the 
       method when  and  are both the length of
       the array.

    Returns Euler's
     Totient (also known as the phi function or Euler's Phi) of the given
     integer.  This is the number of positive integers less than n that share
      no factors with n.

    Returns the
      factorial of the specified non-negative integer.  This is the same as
      the factorial operator .
      
       the factorial
       of a non-negative integer  is the product of all the
       numbers from 1 to .  For example, the factorial
        is equal to  , or
       Efficiently calculates the ratio of two
      factorials , using a binary
       splitting algorithm.  This is used internally in functions like
      .  Using this function is
       faster than calculating the result naïvely.
  
   Other number-theoretical functions, such as those for calculating the
   values of the Riemann Zeta
   function may be available in the Sample Programs library.
  Turns the specified
      expression into an array. This works with enumerating expressions, sets,
      dictionaries, objects created from a , or simple
      expressions (making a single-item array out of the latter.) 
    Flattens a possibly
      multi-dimensional array into a 1-dimensional array.  For example,
      flattening the array  results in .
    Turns the specified expression into a
      string.  The string representation is exactly the same as it would be
      from printing the expression or interpolating it into a string.Perform a recursive
      deep copy of all the parts of a container class.  The function can be
      called with any expression type.  The function currently deep copies
      everything contained in arrays, dictionaries, sets, OrderedLists,
      RingBuffers, and objects created from a 
      specification, and everything contained within them.  It is thus useful
      for copying nested data structures, multi-dimensional arrays (which are
      arrays of arrays, etc.) and prevents modification of the original or the
      copy from changing the other.  It does  currently deep copy
      Java objects, nor Java arrays.
    Arbitrary-precision square root to
      the specified number of digits.  This can take arbitrarily-large and
      small arguments.  This function only works with real-valued inputs.
    Arbitrary-precision square
      root to the specified number of digits.  This can take arbitrarily-large
      and small arguments.  If the input is an integer, this attempts to
      return an exact integer result when possible.  This function only works
      with real-valued inputs. 
    This is a fast function
      (faster than taking the square root) that takes a non-negative integer
      and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of
      x.
    Common logarithm, base 10.  This returns
      exact integers or rational numbers in cases when arguments are integers
      and results are integers or 1 divided by an integer.
    Logarithm of the number  to
     the base , which could also be written  (which works for any base as long as the logarithms are
     taken to the same base) but this version returns exact integers or
     exact rational numbers when arguments are integers when the result is an
     integer or 1 divided by an integer.
    This is a fast algorithm to return a
      value in the vicinity of the logarithm of  to base 2.
      This works efficiently for arbitrary-sized values and is only intended
      to give an approximate "first guess" to numerical algorithms that
      calculate to arbitrary precision.  If you want the 
      logarithm to base 2, use .
    Returns the number of decimal digits
      in a number.  This is intended to support algorithms that calculate to
      arbitrary precision.
    The real part of x.  Note that the result
      will have the same dimensions as the argument.
    The imaginary part of x as a real number.
      Note that the result will have the same dimensions as the argument.
    Returns the complex conjugate of the
      specified number.  Note that the result will have the same dimensions as
      the argument.
    Hyperbolic sine of x, or
      (e - e)/2
    Hyperbolic cosecant of x, or 1/sinh[x], or
      2/(e - e)
    Hyperbolic cosine of x, or 1/sech[x], or
      (e + e)/2
    Hyperbolic secant of x, or 1/cosh[x], or
      2/(e + e)
    Hyperbolic tangent of x, or
      Hyperbolic cotangent of x, or (e + 1) / (e - 1)
    Inverse hyperbolic sine of x,
      or ln[x + sqrt[1 + x^2]]
    Inverse hyperbolic cosine of x,
      or ln[x + sqrt[x-1] sqrt[x+1]]
    Inverse hyperbolic secant of x,
      or ln[sqrt[1/x - 1]*sqrt[1 + 1/x] + 1/x]
    Inverse hyperbolic cosecant of
      x, or ln[sqrt[1 + 1/x^2] + 1/x]
    Inverse hyperbolic tangent of
      x, or 1/2 (ln[1+x] - ln[1-x])
    Inverse hyperbolic cotangent of
      x, or 1/2 ( ln[1 + 1/x] - ln[1 - 1/x] )
    Absolute value.  For complex arguments,
      returns complex number abs[x + iy] = sqrt[x^2 + y^2].  For
      interval arguments, returns an interval (which may contain zero if the
      interval contains zero.) Note that the result will also have the same
      dimensions as the argument!
    Returns the sign of the argument.  For
      real-valued arguments, this returns (-1 if x<0), (0 if x==0), (1 if
      x>0).
      For complex arguments, returns .  For intervals,
      returns an interval containing the signum of each endpoint (which may be
      collapsed to a single value if both endpoints have the same sign.)  Note
      that the result will also have the same dimensions as the argument!
      
    This is a more limited function that
      returns the sign of a real number, ignoring units of measure if they are
      present.  For
      real-valued arguments, this returns (-1 if x<0), (0 if x==0), (1 if
      x>0).
      For all other arguments, this returns .
      
    Pick a random integer between 0
      (inclusive) and  (exclusive.)  If  is an
      array, this returns a random item from the array.
    Pick a random integer between min
      (inclusive) and max (inclusive.)

      Pick a 
      uniformly-distributed random floating-point value in the specifed range.
    Pick a 
      normally-distributed (i.e. "bell curve") random floating-point value
      with the specified mean and standard deviation.
    Generate a random
      positive integer containing  evenly-distributed binary
      bits.
    Generate an array of
      random bytes containing  elements as a Java array of byte.
    To obtain repeatable
      results with a program that generates random numbers, sometimes it is
      desirable to use the same random sequence.  This function seeds the
      random number generator with a known value.  The seed must a number from
      -2 to 2-1 (both inclusive.)
    Returns the number of bits in
      the minimal two's-complement representation of an integer,
       a sign bit.

      (mod ) in an
      efficient manner.
    Performs
      the integer modular division 
      mod  and returns the integer result
      if one exists, otherwise returns .
    Finds the integer modular inverse of  to the base
       and returns the integer result
      if it is invertible, otherwise returns .  In other
      words,  returns an
      integer  such that .
    Returns the
      smaller of the two arguments, or the first argument if they're equal.
    Returns the smallest item in the
      array.
    Returns the
      larger of the two arguments, or the first argument if they're equal.
    Returns the largest item in the
      array.
    Returns the smallest and
      largest elements in an array as a two-item
      array .
    Returns
      the specified number, but limiting its value to lie between the
      specified minimum and maximum.  This also works correctly
      when  is an interval.
    Returns
      the intersection of two intervals, or an interval and a real number.
      (Or two real numbers, but that rarely makes sense.)  The return type
      in this case will be an interval or an ordinary real number.  If there is
      no intersection between the arguments, the function will currently return
       although this behavior may change to return an empty
      interval in the future.  This function also works with dates and date
      intervals.
    Returns
      the union of two intervals, or an interval and a real number.
      (Or two real numbers, in which case an interval containing both real
      numbers is returned.)  The return type will be an interval or an
      ordinary real number if the two numbers are the same real number.  This
      function also works with dates and date intervals.
    Returns true if the argument
      is a dimensionless integer, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the argument
      is a dimensionless rational number (and  an integer,) false
      otherwise.
    Returns true if the argument is
      a real number (with or without dimensions, and not an interval,) false
      otherwise.
    Returns true if the argument
      is a complex number (with or without dimensions,) false otherwise.

    Returns true if the argument
      is a dimensionless positive number, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the number is
      a unit of any type, including dimensionless numbers.
    Returns true if the
      argument is a unit of any type (including dimensionless numbers) with a
      negative sign, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the expression
      is an array, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the
      expression is a dictionary, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the expression
      is a set, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the expression
      is a date/time, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the expression
      is a string, false otherwise.
    Returns true if the
      expression is an operator like  or , false
      otherwise.
    getOperatorPrecedence[]If the
      expression is an operator like  or , this
      returns the precedence of the operator as an integer.  Higher numbers
      indicate higher precedence.  If the expression is not an operator, this
      returns .
    If the expression is
      an operator like  or , this returns the
      symbol of the operator as an string.  If the expression is not an
      operator, this returns .
    Returns the sum of the
      elements of , which can currently be an array or an
      enumerating expression.  If  is of any other type, this
      simply returns .  If the list is empty, this returns
      .  (There is no universal identity element for
      addition when units of measure may be present.)
    Returns the sum of the 
      elements of , which can currently be an array or an
      enumerating expression.  If  is of any other type, this
      simply returns .  If the list is empty, this returns
      .
    Returns the product
      of the elements of , which can currently be an array or an
      enumerating expression.  If  is of any other type, this
      simply returns .  If the list is empty, returns 1.
    Returns the product
      of the elements of , which can currently be an array or an
      enumerating expression.  If  is of any other type, this
      simply returns .  If the list is empty, returns
      .
    Returns the hypotenuse (also called the Euclidean norm) of the
        elements of array x.  The result is normally a scalar value but can
        return a symbolic expression.
    Returns the mean (average) value of the elements of , which can currently be an array or an
      enumerating expression.  This
      function preserves units of measure and can be used symbolically.  It
      uses Welford's algorithm for numerical stability.
    Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the elements of the
     list , which can currently be an array or an
      enumerating
      expression.   is a boolean flag indicating if we
      want the standard deviation to be the  standard deviation
      () or the  standard deviation
      ().  If you are in doubt, it's probably safer and more
      conservative to set this to  (for sample standard
      deviation) giving a larger standard deviation.  This function preserves
      units of measure and can be used symbolically.  It uses Welford's
      algorithm for numerical stability.
      
      Returns an array 
      where  is the mean (average) value,  is
      the standard deviation, and  is the count
      of items in the list.
      Calculates the mode(s) of a list , which can currently
       be an array or an enumerating
       expression.  The modes are the value(s) that occur the most times.
       Each element of the list must be a hashing expression, that is, can be
       used as a key in a dictionary.

      
       This always returns an array because there are potentially multiple
       modes in a list.  This uses the more general
        function to do the work.  The
       modes are not returned in any specific order (because they might
       actually be non-comparable to each other.)
   Sleeps for the specified amount
    of time.  The argument  must have units of time,
    such as  or 
      or .
    Converts the specified
      number into its corresponding value in binary reflected Gray code.
      Example usage:  binaryToGray[0b1111] -> binaryConverts a number from its
      value in binary reflected Gray code to its equivalent numeric value.
    Launches the specified URL in
      the browser (or however your computer is set up to launch URLs.)  This
      requires that your Java Virtual Machine and your operating system are
      configured correctly.
    Returns an array of the
      digits of the non-negative integer  in base 10.
    Returns an
      array of the digits of the non-negative integer  in the
      specified base.
    getExponent[,
      ]Returns the exponent for the specified base
      unit.  The base unit can be specified as a string indicating the name of
      a base unit (e.g.  for meters), a unit of measure,
      e.g. (), or a string indicating the name of a base
      dimension (e.g.  or  or
      .  See the default
       base dimension names.)

      
       For example, to get the exponent corresponding to length (default unit
       is meters) all of the following are equivalent:
      
        getExponent[3 m/s^2, "length"]
        getExponent[3 m/s^2, "m"]
        getExponent[3 m/s^2, "meters"]
        getExponent[3 m/s^2, "feet"]
        getExponent[3 m/s^2, 123.4 m]
        getExponent[3 m/s^2, 3 feet]
       All of the above return the integer , which is the
       exponent for 
       length in the provided expression.  Asking for  or
        or  would return , the
       exponent for the time dimension.  Also note that exponents may be
       rational numbers or zero.
       You will very likely never need this function.  If
       you're using it, you may be doing something sketchy and unwise and
       physically unrealistic, or attempting to subvert unit-checking, or
       missing better input/output routines.  Stop and reconsider your life
       choices.
      Returns an array
      of  pairs which indicate the exponents of the
      base dimensions of a unit of measure.  For example, for the joule:

      [[m, 2], [s, -2], [kg, 1]]
       If the input is dimensionless, this returns an empty array.  If the
       input is not a unit of measure, this returns .
       You will very likely never need this function.  If
       you're using it, you may be doing something sketchy and unwise and
       physically unrealistic, or attempting to subvert unit-checking.  Please
       reconsider.  You may need it if you are creating your own output
       formats
       like MathML.frink, and
       using it with the  function below.
      Returns a dimensionless
      number indicating the scale of a unit of measure as a multiple of the
      base units.  For example, for the kilometer, whose base unit is the
      meter:
      
      
       If the expression is not a unit, this returns .
       You will very likely never need this function.  If
       you're using it, you may be doing something sketchy and unwise and
       physically unrealistic, or attempting to subvert unit-checking.  Please
       reconsider.  You may need it if you are creating your own output
       formats
       like MathML.frink, and
       using it with the  function
       above.
      Factors a unit into a array
      of [, ]
      where  is a dimensionless number indicating a scale
      and  is a unit with scale of 1 and the basic
      dimensions of the original unit.  For example, for the speed of light:
         
      [299792458, 1 m s^-1 (velocity)]
       The resulting values can be multiplied with each other to obtain the
       original value.
       You will very likely never need this function.  If
       you're using it, you may be doing something sketchy and unwise and
       physically unrealistic, or attempting to subvert unit-checking.  Please
       reconsider.
      Returns an array
      of names of the base units in a known order.  For example, this normally
      returns [m, s, kg, A, K, dollar, mol, bit, cd].
      
    Returns an array of names of
      the basic dimensions in a known order.  For example, this normally
      returns [length, time, mass, current, temperature, currency,
      amount_of_substance, information, luminous_intensity].
       
    numerator[, , ]Returns the numerator of an
      expression.  This works on rational numbers, integers, units, and
      arbitrary symbolic expressions.  This collects multiplicative terms that
      are not obviously divisions or negative powers.  See the more
      efficient  below for usage
      and examples.
    denominator[, , ]Returns the denominator of an
      expression.  This works on rational numbers, integers, units, and
      arbitrary symbolic expressions.  This collects multiplicative terms that
      are obviously divisions or negative powers.  If the expression is not
      rational, this returns 1.  See the more
      efficient  below for usage
      and examples.
    numeratorDenominator[, , ]Returns the numerator and
      denominator of an expression as a two-item
      array  This works on
      rational numbers, integers, units, and arbitrary symbolic expressions.
      It is better to use this function than to call 
      and  separately, as it's more efficient.

      
       If  is  (the default), the
       numerator and denominators of rational numbers will be split into the
       numerator and denominator of the result.  If , the
       rational numbers will be kept as rational numbers in the numerator of
       the result.
      
       If  is  (the default),
       dimensions of units of measure with positive exponents will be split
       into the numerator and units of measure with negative exponents will be
       put into the denominator of the result.  If , the
       dimensions will be kept together in the numerator of the result.
      [n,d] = numeratorDenominator[noEval[1/4 G^-1 a^-1 c^4]]
       The following demonstrates the different options when
       splitting :
      [149896229 m (length), 5 s (time)]
       [149896229/5 (exactly 2.99792458e+7) m (length), 1 s (time)]
       [149896229 m s^-1 (velocity), 5]
       [149896229/5 (exactly 2.99792458e+7) m s^-1
       (velocity), 1]
      
       As you can see, sometimes it's more helpful to set both options
       to  when displaying results that are units of
       measure, and to set both to  when formatting symbolic
       equations.
      
       See the
       formatEquation.frink
       sample program to see how  is used
       with  to
       recursively format mathematical expressions.
      Returns the current version of Frink
     as a string.
     
   Returns the current generation
     number of Frink as an integer.  0=Frink original,
     1=Frink:The Next Generation
      Programs can use this flag to warn that, say, calculating thousands of
      digits will be slow in the original version, or even switch behavior
      (e.g. use an integer-based routine in original Frink and a floating-point
      routine in Frink:TNG, which has much faster floating-point routines for
      numbers with many digits.)
     
      To support old versions of Frink before this function exists, you should
      probably wrap it in a call to :
     if eval["FrinkGeneration[]"] != 1
          println["""Note: this program will be orders of magnitude faster with Frink:The Next Generation, available at: https://frinklang.org/experimental.html"""]
      
   Frink can perform Fourier transforms on 1- or 2- dimensional arrays, or on
   images (by calling their  method.  See the FourierImage.frink
   sample progam for a demonstration.)  The functions are:
  DFT[array, divFactor=-1,
     direction=1]inverseDFT[array, divFactor=-1,
     direction=1]Performs a Discrete Fourier Transform of the
     given array.  The array may be 1- or 2-dimensional.
      
      Since different fields of mathematics and engineering use
       different conventions for the Fourier transform, these
       functions allow you to (optionally) specify the scaling factor and
        sign convention.
      
      The (optional) second argument divFactor sets the scaling factor for
      the results:
      
      
      The (optional) third argument direction sets the sign used in the
      exponent.
      
      
       The  function produces the inverse of the DFT
       given by the DFT function.  In fact, it just calls the DFT function
       with appropriately-reversed parameters.
      
        If you specified the optional second or third arguments for the DFT
        function, you will need to pass in the  arguments to the
         function to get the inverse operation.  This
        function takes care of reversing them appropriately.
      FFT[array, divFactor=-1,
      direction=1]inverseFFT[array, divFactor=-1,
      direction=1]Performs a Fast Fourier Transform of the
      given array.  The array may be 1- or 2-dimensional.  The meaning of all
      the arguments are the same as for the 
      and  functions above.

         
          While this function is much faster than , be warned
          that this will pad the array with zeroes to the next largest
          power of 2.  It will thus give a result that is different than
          DFT, often with more terms.
         
          FFT is O(n log n) while DFT is O(n).
         
   The  functions can calculate a variety of
   cryptographic hashes of various strings or arrays of bytes.  The parameters
   for all are of the form:
  messageDigest[,]
   Each function can take as input either a string or an array of Java bytes.
   The  parameter is a string containing one of any
   hashing algorithms your Java platform supports, which probably includes:
   "MD2", "MD5", "SHA", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", "SHA-512".  You
   can see the cryptoProviders.frink
   sample program to see how to dump all message digest types available on
   your virtual machine.
   As of the 2016-09-29 release, the behavior of the
    functions may have changed.  Previously, to turn
   the characters of a Unicode string into bytes, the function used your
   platform's default character encoding.  Now the functions always convert
   the bytes to UTF-8 before creating the digest.  (Your default was likely to
   have been UTF-8 already.)  Using the default encoding made programs
   non-repeatable from one machine to another.  If you want to force a certain
   encoding of Unicode strings into bytes, use the stringToBytes[,
   ] function before calling these functions.
  
   The following calculates the MD5 hash of the string  and
   returns it as a hexadecimal string:
  messageDigest["abc", "MD5"]900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72
   The  function returns the value as an integer,
   which can then be displayed in various bases, have its individual bits
   tested, etc.
  messageDigestInt["abc","MD5"] -> octal2200025023017151117541532261767645070277562
   The  function returns the value as an
   array of Java bytes.   Most of the underlying cryptography
   routines in Java work with arrays of bytes, as these are safer than Strings
   which are immutable after construction and are eventually
   garbage-collected.  Using arrays of bytes means that you can zero-out input
   buffers as soon as you're done with them.
  messageDigestBytes["abc", "SHA-1"]
   Integer values can be converted to and from other bases (from 2 to 36
   inclusive) in several ways.  The following functions can be used to convert
   to or from other arbitrary bases.
  Returns a string representing the
      integer  in base Returns a string
      representing the integer  in the specified base.
    Converts between integer and base-64
      encoded strings.  If passed an integer, returns a string
      representing the integer as a base 64-encoded value.
      This uses standard base-64 indices in the order A-Za-z0-9+/.  If passed
      a base-64 encoded string, this returns an integer with the corresponding
      value.
    Parses a string
      (or enumerating expression of
      strings,) containing digits 0-9 only, to an integer in base 10.  This
      should contain no spaces or other text.
    Parses a
      string (or enumerating expression of
      strings,), treating it as if it's a number in the specified base.  The
      string should contain no spaces or other text.  The base can from 2-36
      (inclusive) or 64, in which case it will use standard base64 encoding.
  
   The following named base conversion functions can also be used.  In the
   cases where several names are commonly used, all options are listed.  All
   functions return strings.
  hexadecimal, sexadecimal, hex
    
   The conversions can be performed by calling the named function, or by using
   the conversion operator (  ).  The following are all
   equivalent, and all convert the number specified by the variable
    to a string in base 8.
  
    base[number, 8]
    base8[number]
    octal[number]
    oct[number]
   Use whichever is most convenient for you.  (Note: the function version will
   be slighly faster.)
  
   As noted above in the Data Libraries section,
   you may  numbers in a specified base by following the number
   with two backslashes and the specified base:
  100001000101111111101101\\2 (a number in
    base 2)
   1000_0100_0101_1111_1110_1101\\2 (a number in base 2 with
    underscores for readability)
     (a number in base 16... bases
    from 2 to 36 are allowed) 
     (The same number in base
    16... upper or lowercase are allowed.)
     (a number in base 16 with underscores for readability)
     (Common hexadecimal notation)
     (Common hexadecimal notation)
     (Hexadecimal with underscores for readability)
   0b100001000101111111101101  (Common binary notation)
   0b1000_0100_0101_1111_1110_1101 (Binary with underscores for readability)
  
   The above base conversions assume that the characters are taken from an
   alphabet like the one for base 36:
   "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", which is common and
   reasonable.  For example, hexadecimal uses the first 16 characters of
   this, .  However, it's not as clear when you
   go beyond base 36 what characters should be used.  You can declare a custom
   "alphabet" of any size to be used in base conversions.
  
   For example, Bitcoin addresses use a base-58 alphabet consisting of the
   characters:
  "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
   Note that this alphabet does not include  (zero),
    (uppercase o),  (uppercase i), 
   (lowercase L), as those are indistinguishable in some fonts.
  
   To convert a number to a string using this alphabet, you can use the
    function where
    is a string which contains the character for the
   "zero" position first.  The radix will be equal to the number of characters
   in the alphabet string.  (In the below example, base 58.)  The following
   turns a numeric value into a Bitcoin address string:
  alphabet = "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    number = 0x00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F66UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM
   (Note that this alphabet does not have a zero as the first character (it
   has a 1,) so if you need to pad it to a certain length, you need to pad
   with the first character in the alphabet.)
  
   Conversely, you can parse an integer with a custom alphabet by using the
    function, which takes
   the same format for its alphabet string.  The example below parses a
   Bitcoin address.
  alphabet = "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    str = "6UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM"25420294593250030202636073700053352635053786165627414518
   (Note that the number obtained above is the decimal equivalent of the
   Bitcoin address encoded above; it could instead be formatted in hexadecimal
   or other formats.)
  
   The strings are allowed to contain any Unicode characters.  If you attempt
   to parse a string that contains characters outside your alphabet, the
   special value  will be returned.
  
   This section demonstrates some custom base conversions.
  
   Devanagari digits are used in Hindi and Sanskrit, and occur in the Unicode
   standard from  (zero) through 
   (nine).  To output a Devanagari integer:
  alphabet = char[0x0966 to 0x096f]
    base[1234567890, alphabet]
   Conversely, a Devanagari integer can be parsed with:
  alphabet = char[0x0966 to 0x096f]
    parseInt["१२३४५६७८९०", alphabet]
   The Unicode standard has a non-contiguous hodgepodge collection of numerals
   that represent superscript numerals, like 10¹².  If you want
   to typeset a string of numbers as superscripts on a Unicode-aware system,
   you can do something like this:
  supAlphabet = "\u2070\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3" + char[0x2074 to 0x2079]
    "10" + base[23, supAlphabet]
   Or, conversely, to parse a stream of these superscript numerals as a single
   number:
  supAlphabet = "\u2070\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3" + char[0x2074 to 0x2079]
    parseInt["²³", supAlphabet]: Note that almost all fonts make Unicode superscript
   numbers look different and not line up.  Does your font look uniform here?
   Mine decidedly does not.
  
   Unicode numerical subscripts are more uniform and contiguous than
   superscripts, thankfully.  They occupy a contiguous range from
    to .
  
   If you want to typeset a string of numbers as subscripts on a
   Unicode-aware system, you can do something like this:
  
    subAlphabet = char[0x2080 to 0x2089]
    "1000" + base[24, subAlphabet]
   If you want to parse a string of these subscripts as a single number, you
   can do something like this:
  subAlphabet = char[0x2080 to 0x2089]
    parseInt["₄₂", subAlphabet]
   Frink can parse Unicode characters that are commonly used as mathematical
   operators.  This allows you to cut-and-paste some mathematical expressions
   without modification and handle them correctly.
  
   Unicode superscript numerals can be used to perform exponentiation, such as
   , which is equivalent to
   , or , which is equivalent to
   .
   Web pages usually  use Unicode superscript
   numerals, but rather  tags for superscripts which
   means that you probably won't be able to paste equations in directly.
  
   The Unicode standard has a non-contiguous hodgepodge collection of numerals
   that represent superscript numerals.  The only superscript characters
   currently recognized are the following:
  Superscript plus
      (must precede digits)
    Superscript minus
      (must precede digits)
  
   You can use the toUnicodeSuperscript[] function to
   turn an integer into a string composed of Unicode superscript digits in
   base 10.
  
   You can use the  function to
   turn an integer into a string composed of Unicode subscript digits in
   base 10.
  
   In addition, some Unicode characters can be used as synonyms for other
   mathematical operators.
  Unicode
      MULTIPLICATION SIGN, synonym for multiplication  operator
    Unicode
      DOT OPERATOR, synonym for multiplication  operator.
      Unicode says "preferred to \u00b7 for denotation of multiplication"
    Unicode
      MIDDLE DOT, synonym for multiplication  operator
      Unicode DIVISION
      SIGN, synonym for division  operator
  
   As an example, the following is parsed correctly by Frink, as it uses
   Unicode (and not HTML) markup:
  ρ = 6.02×10²³ amu ⋅ (6 m³)⁻¹
   Note that Frink does not currently output Unicode, nor give you simplified
   ways to key in Unicode characters.
  
   Text surrounded by double quotes is a string.
  "My hovercraft is full of eels."My hovercraft is full of eels.
   If you need to put a literal double-quote inside a string, precede it with
   a backslash:
  "If you believe in the hypothetical \"Z-Axis\""If you believe in the hypothetical "Z-Axis"
   Backslashes have a special meaning within double-quoted and triple-quoted
   strings.  They may precede a special character, as follows:
  Places a  backslash into the string.
    Places a tab character into the string.
    Places a newline character(s) into the string.  The
      exact characters inserted follow your platforms's Java-defined settings
      for the newline character, which may be one character or two.
    Places a return character into the string.
    Places a double-quote character into the string.
    Places a Unicode character into the
      string, where  is a 4-digit hex value for the Unicode
      codepoint.  For more information, see the Unicode in Strings section of the
      documentation. 
    Places a Unicode character into the
      string, where  is a 1- to 6-digit hex value for the Unicode
      codepoint.  For example, to create a string with a cat face, you would
      use  (this is the Unicode character "GRINNING
      CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES".)  For more information, see the Unicode in Strings section of the
      documentation.
  
   A single backslash preceding any other character simply inserts the
   following character into the string (and removes the backslash.)
  
   Strings can be concatenated using the  operator.  If either
   side of a  operator is a string, the values will be
   converted to strings before concatenation.
  
   For internationalization, Frink allows
   Unicode characters anywhere.
   Strings can contain Unicode characters, indicated in one of a few ways:

  Directly entered with a Unicode-aware editor. If you  have a
    nifty editor that handles Unicode, or other character encodings, you can
    write your Frink program in full Unicode, and load it using the 
    command-line switch.
    
   
    followed by exactly 4 hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F] indicating the Unicode
    code-point.  For example,  indicates the Unicode
      character "HEAVY BLACK HEART".

    where  is anywhere
    from 1 to 6 hexadecimal digits.  For example,  is
    the Unicode character "MONKEY FACE".  Note that using this format is
    required because the hexadecimal value has more than 4 digits.

   High Unicode characters (those with value higher than
    ) can also be represented as a Unicode "surrogate
    pair."  For example, the Unicode character "MONKEY FACE" can also be
    represented as two 4-hex-digit characters: .
    This is for compatibility with environments (such as Java) that represent
    a character as 16 bits.  (The  function
    will produce this format for cross-platform and cross-Java-version
    compatibility.)
  
   The latter two allow Unicode characters to be placed into any ASCII text
   file, and edited by programs that don't understand Unicode.
  "The symbol for micro is \u00b5"The symbol for micro is µ
   You can convert a character to its Unicode character code by using the
    function.
  
   If passed an integer, it returns the character with that Unicode character
   code:
  
   If passed a single-character string, it returns the Unicode character code:
  
   If passed a multiple-character string, it returns the Unicode character
   code for each character in an array:
  
   If you always need an array of character codes, use the
    function which turns a string into an array of
   character codes, even when passed a string containing only one character.
  
   You can also obtain the results in a different base:
  
   If passed an array of integers, the  function
   returns a string:
  char[ [70, 114, 105, 110, 107] ]
   The  function returns a list of the
   characters in a string, each as a string of a single codepoint length.  As
   of the 2024-10-17 release, it uses an efficient cache to return results.
  
   The  function returns a list of the
   Unicode names of the characters (codepoints) in a string.  (Requires Java
   1.7 or later.)  This returns an empty string if a Unicode codepoint is
   undefined or if the Java Virtual Machine does not know its name (JVMs lag
   far behind the latest Unicode definitions.)
  [SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH, EXCLAMATION MARK]
   If passed an array of positive
   integers,  returns a list of the Unicode
   names of the characters in a string.  (Requires Java 1.7 or later.)  Note
   that Unicode characters are usually specified in hexadecimal, which
   requires prefixing hexadecimal integer values with :
  charNames[[0x1f63a, 0x21]][SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH, EXCLAMATION MARK]
   The  function works similarly to
   the  functions above but if passed a single-character
   string, it will return a single string.  (Requires Java 1.7 or later.)
   This returns an empty string if a Unicode codepoint is undefined or if the
   Java Virtual Machine does not know its name (JVMs lag far behind the latest
   Unicode definitions.)
  
   If passed a multiple-character string, 
   behaves the same as the  function and returns an
   array of character names.
  
   The  function can also take a single
   integer as an argument.  It returns the name of the specified Unicode
   codepoint. (Requires Java 1.7 or later.)  Note that Unicode characters are
   usually specified in hexadecimal, which requires prefixing hexadecimal
   integer values with :
  SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH
   Frink provides several functions to process strings correctly using Unicode
   rules.  When working with Unicode, almost all algorithms should work on
   entire  to be correct, not individual characters.  (This is
   why Frink doesn't even have a character type.)
  
   The following functions operate on strings and allow you to enumerate
   through their parts.  Each of the following returns an enumerating
   expression that allows you to loop through the contents of a string in
   different, Unicode-correct ways:
  This returns an enumerating list of the  in a string,
      each as a string of 1 or more Unicode codepoints.

      
       To quote the Unicode standard:
      
        "It is important to recognize that what the user thinks of as a
        'character'--a basic unit of a writing system for a language--may not
        be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be
        made up of multiple Unicode code points. To avoid ambiguity with the
        computer use of the term character, this is called a user-perceived
        character. For example, 'G' + acute-accent is a user-perceived
        character: users think of it as a single character, yet is actually
        represented by two Unicode code points. These user-perceived
        characters are approximated by what is called a grapheme cluster,
        which can be determined programmatically."
       
       For example, the string 
       represents a  with combining diaeresis followed by the
       letter .  Or, in other words,
       .  Note that while there are three
       Unicode codepoints, only two "graphemes" are displayed.
      
       As another example, the Devanagari string
       "\u0915\u094D\u0937\u093F"
       (shown as क्षि ) is recognized as a single
       grapheme and should generally be kept intact and counted as a single
       display glyph in functions like 
       below.
      
       The  function now uses a
       grapheme-based reverse algorithm.  See below.
      Returns the length of a
      string in , counting multiple Unicode codepoints that
      should be combined together as a single display glyph as a single
      character.
      
    Reverses the characters in a
      string.
      As of the 2016-05-27 release, this is a smarter reversal
       that follows Unicode rules to keep combining characters together and
       properly ordered.
      
       For example, the string 
       represents a  with combining diaeresis followed by the
       letter .  Or, in other words,
       .
       Reversing this naïvely would cause the diaeresis to incorrectly
       show over the  instead of the .
      
       As another example, the Devanagari string
       "\u0915\u094D\u0937\u093F"
       (shown as क्षि ) is recognized as a single
       grapheme and the 4 Unicode codepoints that make it up are kept intact
       and not reversed.
      
       Yes, this stuff is tricky.  It may not always reverse strings to the
       exact rules used in your language, but it will attempt to reverse the
       string according to the rules encoded in the Unicode standard.
      
       If you, for some reason, need a naïve and broken string reversal,
       you can do something like:
      reverse[charList[]]
       but keep in mind that this will  do the right thing like
       keeping surrogate pairs ordered correctly.  You'll have to try hard to
       make Frink do the wrong thing.  Don't do this.  It's never right for
       Unicode strings.  Frink tries to always work on Unicode
       , and not individual characters, as working on
       individual characters or codepoints is almost always the wrong thing to
       do when processing Unicode.
      Returns an enumeration of the words in a string.  This function
      provides correct interpretaion of punctuation marks within and following
      words.  It also correctly handles hyphenated words.  Note that this
      returns words, spacing, and punctuation marks.

      
       The following example solves a typical programming interview task:
       reversing the words in a string.  It throws away any words that don't
       contain an alphanumeric value, and collapses multiple spaces into one.
      a = "This does a Unicode-correct word reversal (wasn't that easy?)"
        join[" ", reverse[select[wordList[a], %r/[[:alnum:]]/ ]]]easy that wasn't reversal word Unicode-correct a does ThiswordList[, ]
     Same as  above but 
      specifies  a language specifier. See
      the Language Specifiers section below. 

    This returns an enumeration of the sentences in a string.  Sentences
      are parsed with correct interpretation of periods within numbers and
      abbreviations, and trailing punctuation marks such as quotation marks
      and parentheses.
      
    sentenceList[, ]
     Same as  above but 
      specifies  a language specifier. See
      the Language Specifiers section below. 

    Returns an enumeration of the places that a line can be broken.  It
      correctly handles punctuation, numbers, and hyphenated words.
      
    lineBreakList[, ]
     Same as  above but 
      specifies  a language specifier. See
      the Language Specifiers section below. 
      
    lexicalCompare[, ]
     Compares 2 strings using a comparison method that understands human
      languages.  This version uses the default locale and language settings
      defined on  Java Virtual Machine to perform the comparison.

      
       The function is similar to, but much smarter than the
       three-way
        comparison operator.  Like the three-way comparison operator, it
        returns
        if, lexicographically, ,
        if
       , and  if  and
       can thus be used in sorting functions.
      
       As of the 2024-07-11 release,  now compares
       sub-arrays also.  For example, in an array of
       arrays,  sorts before .
       Shorter arrays sort before longer ones.
      
       See the Lexical Sorting section of the
       documentation for more on lexical comparisons.
      lexicalCompare[, , ]
     Like the previous function, this compares 2 strings using a
      comparison method that understands human languages.  This version uses a
      specified language.  The argument  can be one
      of three types:

      
       See the Lexical Sorting section of the
       documentation for more on lexical comparisons.
      normalizeUnicode[, ]
     Normalizes the characters in a Unicode string using one of the
      methods described in the Unicode standard,
      specifically Unicode Standard Annex #15,
       Unicode Normalization Forms.

      
       A Unicode string can use various methods to encode what is essentially
       the same character/glyph.  For example, the character
        can be represented as either 
       or .  The former is a "precomposed"
       character, "LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX", and the latter is
       two Unicode codepoints, an  followed by "COMBINING
       CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT".  (This is usually referred to as a "decomposed"
       representation.)   Unicode normalization rules can convert these
       "equivalent" encodings into a canonical representation.
      Unicode
       Standard Annex #15 currently defines four different methods of
       converting between these representations.  (You might get the best idea
       of the differences between these by looking at figure 6 in the
       document.)
      The  parameter is a string containing the names of
       one of these conversion methods, which can consist of
        (the default), ,
       , and .  Please read Unicode Standard Annex #15
       for a description of the differences in these algorithms, as the
       procedures involved are quite detailed and beyond the scope of this
       document.  Again, figure 6 in that document will give you a quick idea
       of the diferences.
      
       In short, for many purposes,  is recommended for
       interchange, and for its compactness and simplicity, and is thus the
       default.
      
       If the string is already normalized to the requested form, the
       original string is returned unmodified.
      
       This normalization process is useful when, say, using Unicode strings
       as dictionary keys.  Two different keys that might be considered
       identical may not have the same representation without normalization.
      
   The , , and
    functions above can take an optional "Language
   specifier" to allow Frink to process text using a different human
   language's rules.  A language specifier can be one of the following:
  A string containing a
    2-letter ISO 639-1 code for the language, such
    as  for English.
    
   A longer language specifier such as  (English,
       US region)
         
   
    The functions  or
     and  or
     convert a string to upper- or lowercase.
    These functions use Unicode single- and multiple-character mapping tables
    and thus try to do the right thing with Unicode, possibly making the
    string longer in some cases:
  
   The following functions return substrings of a string.
   as of the 2014-07-01 release, all Frink functions handle high
   Unicode codepoints (that is, above ,) correctly as a
   single character (unlike Java.)  These are easier to use in almost all
   situations.  If you need the more cumbersome Java-style
   behavior, such as to communicate with Java methods, use the functions in
   the Raw String Functions section.
  substr[, , ]
      substring[, , ]
     
      Takes the substring of string  beginning with
       and ending  the character position
      .
      The length of the substring will be .

    substrLen[, , ]
      substringLen[, , ]
     
      Takes the substring of string  beginning with
       and containing  characters.

    left[, ]
      right[, ]
     
      Returns a string containing the leftmost or rightmost characters of the
      given string with the specified length.  If  is
      negative, it returns a string with  characters removed,
      that is, if the original string is 5 characters long, and
       is , 4 characters are returned.  In any
      case, if the original string is shorter than the number of characters
      requested, the string returned will contain only the number of
      characters available, but will not return an error.

    
      Returns the index (zero-based) of the first occurrence of a substring in
      a string.  This returns -1 if the substring is not found in the string.

    indexOf[, , ]
     
      Returns the index (zero-based) of the first occurrence of a substring in
      a string starting with position .  This returns -1
      if the substring is not found in the string.
      
    lastIndexOf[, ]
     
      Returns the index (zero-based) of the last occurrence of a substring in
      a string.  This returns -1 if the substring is not found in the string.

    lastIndexOf[, , ]
     
      Returns the index (zero-based) of the last occurrence of a substring in
      a string starting backwards from position .  This
      returns -1 if the substring is not found in the
      string.   should be no larger
      than .

    startsWith[, ]
     
      Returns true if  begins with .
      If  is the empty string, this returns true.
      
    startsWith[, , ]
     
      Returns true if  begins with ,
      starting from integer position , false otherwise.
      If  is the empty string, this returns true.
       should be no larger than
      .
      
    
      Returns true if  ends with .
      If  is the empty string, this returns true.
   as of the 2014-07-01 release, all Frink functions handle high
   Unicode codepoints (that is, above ,) correctly as a
   single character (unlike Java.)  If you need the more cumbersome Java-style
   behavior, such as to communicate with Java, these functions behave more
   like the Java versions, possibly treating high Unicode characters as two
   separate characters.
  Returns the Java-style raw UTF-16-style length of a String, as
      reported by Java.
      
    Returns an array of the raw Java-style UTF-16 encoded characters in a
      string.
      
    substrRaw[, , ]
      substringRaw[, , ]
     
      Takes the substring of string  beginning with the raw
      position  and ending  the raw
      character position , using the raw Java offset
      indices.  The length of the substring will be
       raw Java characters long.

    substrLenRaw[, , ]
      substringLenRaw[, , ]
     
      Takes the substring of string  beginning with the raw
      character position  and containing 
      raw Java-style characters.

    indexOfRaw[, ]
     Returns the index (zero-based) of the first occurrence of a substring
      in a string.  This returns -1 if the substring is not found in the
      string.
      
    indexOfRaw[, , ]
     Returns the index (zero-based) of the first occurrence of a substring
      after position  in a string.  This returns -1 if
      the substring is not found in the string. 
  
   Additional functions for manipulating strings are listed below.
  Returns a string with whitespace
      trimmed from the left and right ends.
    Returns the length of a string
      in Unicode codepoints.  This correctly counts characters above Unicode
       as a single character, which is different than the
      somewhat messy Java behavior.  

       However, this may not be the length of characters that a
        user sees.  For that, see the following
        function which handles Unicode
       more correctly.
       If you need the more cumbersome Java-style behavior, such
       as to communicate with Java methods, use the functions in the Raw String Functions section.
      Returns the length of a
      string in , counting multiple Unicode codepoints that
      should be combined together as a single display glyph as a single
      character.
      
      
       To quote the Unicode standard:
      
        "It is important to recognize that what the user thinks of as a
        'character'--a basic unit of a writing system for a language--may not
        be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be
        made up of multiple Unicode code points. To avoid ambiguity with the
        computer use of the term character, this is called a user-perceived
        character. For example, 'G' + acute-accent is a user-perceived
        character: users think of it as a single character, yet is actually
        represented by two Unicode code points. These user-perceived
        characters are approximated by what is called a grapheme cluster,
        which can be determined programmatically."
       
       Also see the Correct String Parsing
       section of the documentation for more functions for parsing Unicode
       strings correctly.
      Parses a string, containing
      digits 0-9 only, to an integer in base 10.  This is much less powerful
      and less forgiving than using , but faster. 
    Parses a
      string, treating it as if it's a number in the specified base.
    Repeats the string
      the specified number of times and returns it as a string.
    padLeft[, ,
      ]Pads the left side of the string to the specified
      width, using the one-character string  as the character to
      pad with.  If the string is already longer than the specified width, it
      returns the original string unchanged.  If the first argument is not
      already a string, it is converted to a string.
    padRight[, ,
      ]Pads the right side of the string to the specified
      width, using the one-character string  as the character to
      pad with.  If the string is already longer than the specified width, it
      returns the original string unchanged.  If the first argument is not
      already a string, it is converted to a string.
    Returns
      the  or  between two
      strings.  This is the minimum number of operations needed to transform
      one string into the other, where an operation is an insertion, deletion,
      or replacement.  It can be used to aid in spell checking, fuzzy
      spelling, plagiarism detection, and determining similarity of two
      strings.  The algorithm used runs in O(n*m) time, where n and m are the
      lengths of each string.  It uses O(m) space when processing.  The
      comparison  case-sensitive.  The following are examples of
      edit distances between strings: 
      1 Replacement + 1 Insertion
      editDistanceDamerau[, ]Returns the Levenshtein-Damerau edit distance between two strings.  This is
    similar to the  function above, but also allows
       between two adjoining characters, which count as an edit
      distance of 1.  This may make distances between some strings shorter, by
      say, treating transposition errors in a word as a less expensive
      operation than in the pure Levenshtein algorithm.
      
      Swap of adjoining characters
      editDistanceDamerau[, ,
      , , ,
      ]Returns the Levenshtein-Damerau edit distance
      between two strings as above, but allows you to specify the
       of the delete, insert, replace, and swap operations as
      integers.  (Default is 1 for each in the above algorithm.)
      
      
       For stability,  must be >= insertCost +
        deleteCost.
      
       If you want to, say, disallow replacements, you can set the cost for
       the replacement parameter to be higher than the length of either
       string.  For example:
      
        editDistanceDamerau["ABCD", "CBAD", 1, 1, 1000, 1]base64Encode[, ]Encodes the specified expression (which is probably a string, but can also be a Java array of bytes) to base-64 encoding,
      first converting Unicode characters to raw bytes using the specified
      encoding.  (Hint: "UTF-8" is probably good for the encoding.  The
      receiver will have to use the same encoding to make Unicode work
      correctly.  If the input is a Java array of bytes, the encoding should
      be .)

    base64Encode[, ,]Encodes to base-64 as above, wrapping lines at the specified line length.

    base64Decode[, ]Decodes
    the specified base-64 text into a string.  Raw bytes are converted to
    Unicode characters using the specified encoding. (Hint: This encoding will
    have to match the encoding used in the  function
    above to make non-ASCII characters work correctly.  "UTF-8" might be a
    good choice.)

    base64DecodeToBytes[]Decodes
      the string (which should contain base-64 encoded text) into an array of
      raw bytes.

    Encodes a string into an
      ASCII-safe equivalent, with characters outside the ASCII range turned
      into Unicode escapes.  Note that, unlike , this
      function splits Unicode codepoints above  into
      surrogate pairs for portability.  Also see
      the Formatters section of the documentation,
      especially inputForm for a safer way to quote
      and encode strings.

    Encodes a string into an
      ASCII-safe equivalent, with characters outside the ASCII range turned
      into Unicode escapes.  Unlike , this preserves
      Unicode codepoints above  as a single codepoint in
      Frink's input format  that may contain from 1 to 6
      hexadecimal digits.  Also see the Formatters
      section of the documentation,
      especially inputForm for a safer way to quote
      and encode strings.

    toUnicodeSuperscript[]Turns an integer
      into a string containing the equivalent Unicode superscript digits in
      base 10.

    Turns an integer
      into a string containing the equivalent Unicode subscript digits in
      base 10.

    stringToBytes[, ]
     Turns a string into an array of Java bytes using the specified
      encoding to turn a Unicode string into bytes.  The encoding defaults to
      UTF-8, but can be a string indicating any encoding supported on your
      system.
      
       See the encodings.frink sample
      program to see how to list all character encodings (and their aliases)
       available on your system.
       
    bytesToString[, ]
     Turns a an array of bytes (either a Java array of bytes or an array
      of Frink integers that all fit into a byte) into a string using the
      specified encoding.  The encoding defaults to UTF-8, but can be a string
      indicating any encoding supported on your system.
      
       See the encodings.frink sample
      program to see how to list all character encodings (and their aliases)
       available on your system.
  
   The Unicode standard defines various properties of each character (called
   codepoints).  Frink gives you several functions to query properties of
   each codepoint.
  
   The Unicode "General Category" property defines long and short category
   names for each type of character, for example, "" and
   "".  See
   the The
   Unicode Standard, section 4.5.
  
   For example, the following program prints a table of all currency symbols
   (general category "") defined in Unicode :
  for i=0 to 0x1FFFF
   if charCategoryShort[i] == "Sc"
      println[char[i] + "\t" + toASCIIHigh[char[i]] + "\t" + charName[i]]
   $    $         DOLLAR SIGN
¢    \u00a2    CENT SIGN
£    \u00a3    POUND SIGN
¤    \u00a4    CURRENCY SIGN
֏    \u058f    ARMENIAN DRAM SIGN
؋    \u060b    AFGHANI SIGN
৲    \u09f2    BENGALI RUPEE MARK
৳    \u09f3    BENGALI RUPEE SIGN

    ...  ...
   Returns the short
      Unicode general category as a string, e.g.  for
      "Letter, uppercase".  If  is a single-character
      string, this returns a single string.  If  is a
      multi-character string, this returns an array of strings.
      If  is an integer, this returns the category for
      that codepoint.
    Returns the long
      Unicode general category as a string, e.g. "Letter,
      uppercase".  The interpretation of the argument is the same as
      for  above.
    charCategoriesShort[]Returns the short
      Unicode general category as an array of strings.  This differs
      from  in that it always returns
      an  of strings, even when passed a single-character
      string.  In addition, if passed an array of integers (indicating Unicode
      codepoints), or a single integer, this will return an  of
      short category strings for each codepoint.
    Returns the long
      Unicode general category as an array of strings.  The interpretation of
      the argument is the same as for  above.
    Returns the Unicode block
      name as a string, e.g. , ,
      or .  If  is a
      single-character string, this returns a single string.
      If  is a multi-character string, this returns an
      array of strings.  If  is an integer, this
      returns the block for that codepoint.
    Returns the Unicode block
      name as an array of strings.  This differs from 
      in that it always returns an  of strings, even when passed
      a single-character string.  In addition, if passed an array of integers
      (indicating Unicode codepoints), or a single integer, this will return
      an  of block names for each codepoint.
  
   Text surrounded by three sets of double-quotes is a multi-line string (like
   in Python.)  Newlines are allowed and retained in the string. Hopefully,
   this is less burdensome and error-prone than Perl's "here-document" syntax.
   For example:
  
    lyrics = """Oh, Danny Boy,
    The pipes, the pipes are calling
    From glen to glen and down the mountainside"""
   This is also useful when you have strings that contain double quotes, as it
   eliminates the need for escaping those quotes:
  quote = """We will say "ni" to you again if you do not appease us."""
   If a double-quoted string or multi-line string contains a dollar sign
   () followed by a variable name (which must begin with a
   letter), the value of that variable is replaced in the string at evaluation
   time.  This is (probably) faster than string concatenation which could be
   used to get the same effect.  There are certain optimizations to make sure
   that this isn't significantly more inefficient if the string doesn't need
   replacement.  (The string is checked for dollar signs at compile time.)
  first = "Inigo"
    last = "Montoya"
    "My name is $first $last."My name is Inigo Montoya.
   If you need to explicitly mark where the variable name begins and ends, you
   can put it in curly braces as below:
  last="Frink"
    "You can call me the ${last}meister."You can call me the Frinkmeister.
   Since a variable name must begin with a letter, it's fine to put a quantity
   like  into the string, and no substitution will be
   attempted, and there will be no runtime performance penalty.  To put a
   literal dollar sign into the string immediately preceding an letter
   character, use two dollar signs:
  "I want my $$USD 2.00.  Plus tip."I want my $USD 2.00.  Plus tip.
   For best performance,  use double dollar signs like this
   unless they directly precede an letter character.
  
   You can always use this technique to coerce a numeric value, or a unit, or
   a date, etc., to a string representation by enclosing it in quotes:
  n = 2^13367-1
   stringRep = "$n"
   After the above code, the variable  contains the
   result of the calculation  which you can use to grab
   certain characters, truncate, etc. Note that the
    function does the same thing, and can
   often be used on the same line.
   This feature requires connection to the
   internet.  If you are using Frink on a handheld device, you may incur
   connection charges.  Also, since I cannot guarantee the availability of any
   internet sites, this feature is intended only as a bonus that may not work
   reliably if at all.  You may also require some
   proxy configuration if you use an HTTP
   proxy server to access the web.
  
   Text can be translated into other languages:
  "My hovercraft is full of eels." -> German"I will not buy this record; it is scratched." -> Spanish
   Nice translation.  All of these are equivalent to calling the same-named
   function:
  German["My hovercraft is full of eels."]
   Or, to translate  another language, use the
    conversion, or the appropriate keyword:
   ->
    FromSpanish
   or
   (Thanks to Brian C. White discovering the above gem of translation, which
   is literally correct.)  So it's not perfect, and it sure helps if your
   operating system is set up to display Unicode characters correctly.  Or,
   you can do round-trips:
  "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak." ->
    Spanish -> The alcohol is arranged but the meat is weak.
   You can also define a function to do the same as the above:
  corrupt[x] := x -> Spanish -> 
   orcorrupt[x] := Ingles[Spanish[x]]
   You can also build up more complex strings:
  "The German word for \"dog\" is \"" + German["dog"] + ".\""The German word for "dog" is "."
   And you can use Frink to not just translate the words, but the words and
   the units:
  "My farm is " + (220000 acres -> "hectares") + ",
    but it's not arable land." -> German"Gasoline costs " + (round[1.37 USD/gallon /
    (EUR/liter), 0.01]) + " Euro/liter in the United States." -> German
   Ooh, that's cool.  If I had this when I lived in Germany, I might have
   seemed semi-literate.
  
   The following table summarizes the language pairs that can be translated
   and their keywords.  The  translations use your operating
   system's language setting, which  detect your default
   language and Do The Right Thing most of the time.  When you're translating
    another language, you need to indicate what the foreign
   language is.  Keywords like  (the Italian word for
   English) imply that you're translating from Italian to English.

   As of 2011-12-01, Google has eliminated free access to their translation
   APIs, so they are no longer available through Frink.
  
   Here's a small program that can be used to make a mini-translator for a
   specific language.  It allows you to enter phrases to be translated without
   entering the quotes and other bits.  It will continue to translate phrases
   until you click the "OK" button without entering a phrase, or until you
   cancel the dialog using your windowing system's methods.  (See Making Interactive Interfaces for
   more details.)
  while phrase=input["Enter phrase in Portuguese: "]
       println[phrase -> FromPortuguese]
   Even though JSON
   (JavaScript Object Notation) is a terrible standard based on an even more
   terrible language, (JavaScript doesn't even have , if
   you can believe that,) you can still parse it easily in Frink.
   will parse a JSON document and return
   it as a Frink datatype.  Objects are converted to a Frink 
   with the keys stored as strings.  The  type is converted
   to .
  
   As a demonstration of JSON parsing, the following example reads from a
   remote URL which returns a JSON document, making the current value of
   Bitcoin into a globally-accessible Frink unit according to the CoinDesk
   Bitcoin Index (Powered by CoinDesk).  See the CoinDesk API for
   information about the various data sources available.
  
   Note that the following program is essentially a one-line program that
   parses a JSON document and extracts its data with correct units of measure
   in the result.
  
    bitcoin := parseJSON[read["http://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice/USD.json"]]@"bpi"@"USD"@"rate_float" USD
   The value of a certain number of Bitcoins can be then converted like any
   other currency.
  63.29625 dollar (currency)
   Or, you can convert in the reverse direction, for example, if you want to
   pay someone 10 Euro:
  
   This code is available, with more comments, in the bitcoin.frink sample program.
  
   Also, if this is useful to you, you can pay me in Bitcoin at the address: 1dersa3eR2tXQATLCqTrqQ84aecpQBVmm
   Frink has the ability to define specific points in time and add time
   intervals to them, to convert between timezones, or to subtract dates from
   each other.  Date literals are surrounded by pound signs ()
   and can be entered in a wide variety of formats, but I prefer a format like:
  
   Note that I've chosen to have most-significant digits first, as is only
   logical (the world will realize this someday.) You can have whitespace
   preceding or following the # signs for readability.  All of the predefined
   formats are defined in
   .
   Check that file first to see the formats that are already defined.  If the
   format you want is not there, see below for ways to define your own
   formats.
  
   You can also parse a string into a date using the
    function.  This returns the string
   parsed into a date/time datatype, or returns  if the
   string cannot be parsed as a date using any of the defined date formats.
  
   All date/time formats also allow a timezone specifier at the end.  This
   timezone specifier can be a 3-letter code like "UTC" or "MST", but you can
   also use the name of a country or U.S. state (if the country or state has a
   single time zone) or a selected city (of course, not all cities are
   available.)  This means that you don't have to know when daylight savings
   time starts and ends.  The names are chosen from the globally-used Olson
   timezone database, and Frink allows shortening of the Olson timezones, say,
   from "Europe/Paris" to simply "Paris".  The following are all valid inputs:
  # 2002-01-03 10:00 AM New York ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Colorado ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM US/Mountain ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Eastern ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Hawaii ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM America/New_York ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM France ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Paris ## 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Europe/Paris #
   If you do  specify a timezone, the timezone used will be the
   timezone obtained from your Java Virtual Machine (which is probably the
   timezone set on  computer.)
  
   While the Olson timezone database is very complete, and has named rules for
   basically all official timezones in the world, sometimes your data source
   only tells you the offset from UTC or GMT, or may even have custom offsets
   in minutes.  If this is the case, the timezone offset from UTC can be
   specified in one of the following formats:
  
   (Please note that, due to the plus and minus symbols, these timezone
   specification must be in double quotes on the right-hand-side of
   the  operator:)
  # August 25, 2019 16:00 # -> "GMT+07:00"
   So, for example, if your data source is in the ISO-8601 format that doesn't
   allow you to use named timezones (it only allows only numbered timezones or
   the letter ) and looks like:
  2014-06-02T02:24:10-06:00
   Then Frink will parse the trailing  as a timezone
   specification.  (Again, see all the date formats that Frink parses by
   default in the  file.)
  
   The trailing  (for "Zulu time", an alias for UTC,) in the
   following ISO-8601 format indicates that the time is in UTC.
   The Olson timezone database and the POSIX standard (and the
   Java Virtual Machine) define timezones called something like
    (or, using Frink's shorter notation,
   ), but you must be  that the
   sign convention of these zones is  of what any rational
   person would choose, and  of the other sign conventions in
   Frink!  In the Olson/POSIX/Java world,  is actually 7
   hours  of GMT.  Yes, in that weird world,
    means GMT  seven hours.  Augh.  (And you
   wonder why all of my documentation is full of diatribes against the
   stupidity of almost every major standard.)
  
   This is a horrible, insane convention and it  bite you or the
   people you try to communicate with (unless you both accidentally share the
   same random form of insanity and wrongness.)  They will think you are crazy
   if you follow this convention.  Yet it's the convention used by a large
   fraction of the world's software, so Frink keeps these timezones around
   (for now) in case you have to communicate with other software that uses the
   insane Olson/POSIX conventions.  But  use these conventions
   otherwise.
  
   The 4-digit timezone formats listed in the Custom Timezones section above use correct and
   rational definitions of these sign conventions.  If you are using custom
   timezones, you are most strongly warned to use the 4-digit versions like
    or .  These will be correct.
    will mean GMT  2 hours.  But don't
   confuse these 4-digit versions with the shorter 1- or 2-digit
   Olson/POSIX/Java versions like  or  or
    which should be considered weird and wrong (unless
   you're communicating with a source that produces these timezone names
   according to the weird and wrong Olson/POSIX/Java rules.  For now, Frink
   will let you use those weird conventions, but it will scowl and furrow its
   brow at you and someday in the future it may not allow them at all.  I might
   completely disallow the shorter versions of these timezone names
   ( reject  while still allowing the more
   foolhardy )
  
   The function  will return an enumeration of all
   known time zone names.
  
   Please note that your Java implementation may not
   have all of the timezones named in these examples.  Notably, Java 1.1
   distributions tended to use only a small number of three-letter timezones,
   like .
  
   The function  with one argument will
   return all timezone names that match the specified pattern.  The pattern
   can be anything matched by the select function: that
   is, a function (that returns  for matches,) a regular
   expression, or an exact substring.  The following returns all the names of
   all timezones that contain the exact string :
  [Canada/Central, Central, Central_African_Republic, Central African Republic, US/Central]
   The following example will return the timezones that contain the specified
   string "Den" with a case-insensitive match, using the  function and a regular expression.
  select[timezones[], %r/Den/i][Aden, Sweden, Denver, America/Denver, Asia/Aden, Brazil/DeNoronha, Denmark, DeNoronha]
   The function  with no arguments will return the name
   of the default timezone.
  
   If you don't specify an exact date, the date will be treated roughly as
   "today."  This is useful for getting a quick-and-dirty timezone conversion,
   but if you want to get the day right, you should specify the date as above.
  
   Conversion to local timezone, assuming today:AD 2002-01-06 10:00:00.000 AM (Sun) Mountain Standard
    Time
   Conversion of local time to another timezone:AD 2002-01-07 10:00:00.000 AM (Mon) Japan Standard

   Conversion between arbitrary timezones:# 6:00 PM Bosnia # -> "New York"AD 2002-01-06 12:00:00.000 PM (Sun) Eastern Standard
    Time
   Note that running the above simplified conversions at different times of
   the year will give you different results because of differences in the
   Daylight Savings Time rules for each country.
  
   Also, please note that your Java implementation may not
   have all of the timezones named in these examples.  Notably, Java 1.1
   distributions tended to use only a small number of three-letter timezones,
   like .  Use the  function to list the
   timezones defined on your system.
  
   The function  will return the current
   date/time.
  
   In an interactive session, you can use the string  as shorthand for "now."  This should evaluate to
   the time at which the value was , which is why it won't
   usually do what you intend in a program... the value would be the time the
   program was originally run and parsed.
  
   Time is only as accurate as your computer's clock
   setting.  (I use AtomTime on Windows
   machines to keep the clock synchronized to the atomic clock.)
  
   By default, times are displayed in the local timezone and using your locale
   information (but are internally stored correctly in Julian Day relative to
   Universal Time.)  You can also convert to another time format by specifying
   it after the arrow operator.  "JD" for Julian Day, "JDE" for Julian Day
   (Ephemeris) referenced to Dynamical Time, "MJD" for Modified
   Julian Day are supported, as well as finding the times in selected
   timezones, cities and countries:
  Example:  predicted 
   that the peak of this year's Perseid meteor shower might be around August
   12, 2001 at 0400 UTC:
  Converting to local time (the default behavior:)AD 2001-08-11 10:00:00.000 PM (Sat) Mountain Daylight TimeConverting to another time zone:# 2001-08-12 04:00 UTC # -> JapanAD 2001-08-12 01:00:00.000 PM (Sun) Japan Standard Time
   Current time in Germany:AD 2001-12-28 07:20:01.508 AM (Fri) Central European Time
   Current time in another state that just has a single timezone:AD 2010-12-28 07:20:01.508 AM (Fri) Hawaii Standard Time
   Current Julian Day:
   Current Julian Day Ephemeris:
   Convert Julian Day Ephemeris to a date:AD 2000-01-01 04:58:56.170 AM (Sat) Mountain Standard Time
   Actually, since 2003-06-12, Frink uses full precision (usually rational
   numbers) when storing dates, so the Julian day may come out as a rational
   number like:
  JD 211924042672877/86400000 (approx. 2452824.5679731136)
   If you don't desire this much precision, you can use the
    or  function and
   divide by  to get the Julian date as a
   floating-point number, not a string or a rational number:
  
   You can subtract one date from another, or add/subtract a time interval to
   a date.  So, if I wanted to find out when I was 1 billion seconds old, I
   add it to my birthdate:
  #1969-08-19 16:54 Mountain# + 1 billion secondsAD 2001-04-27 06:40:40.000 PM (Fri) Mountain Daylight Time
   That was pretty recently.  You not only forgot my birthday but you forgot
   my 1-billion-second-anniversary.  Bastard.  I have a 
   wish list at Amazon.com if you still want to buy me something.
   You may notice that adding units of months or years (or
   commonyear, etc.)  may not give you the results you expect--that is because
   months and years are  fixed-size units, and even having a unit
   called "month" or "year" is inherently ill-advised.  Perhaps later there
   will be "increment/decrement" of these individual fields on Date objects,
   but it's better to make sure that you understand these are 
   inherently troublesome and often meaningless operations.  ( what
   does it mean to increment the month on a date representing Jan. 31?)  Use
   fixed-size units if you can.
  
   You can subtract one date from another, and receive an answer as a Unit
   with dimensions of time (that you can convert to any scale you
   want... you're used to this by now.)  For example, if you want to know how
   many days until Christmas:
  #2002-12-25# - now[] -> days
   (Try inverting the above calculation to see exactly when I wrote this!)
  
   Note that these calculations do not take leap seconds into account by
   default.  If you want these calculations to take leap seconds into account,
   see the Leap Seconds section of the
   documentation.
  
   The human-defined Gregorian (and Julian) calendars are full of weirdnesses
   and inconsistencies.
  
   However, sometimes you still need to iterate through these varying-length
   units.  Frink gives a variety of functions to manipulate calendar dates.
   The functions are intentionally chosen to be functions that make sense, and
   Frink tries to avoid providing functions that don't make sense (for
   example, some date/time libraries let you take a date like January 31, 2019
   and increment the month field.  Since there is no Feburary 31, the results
   simply don't and can't make any sense.)
  
   Note that these functions will sometimes produce surprising (but
   consistent) results!  Years and months are of varying length.  Some years
   are longer than others by a day (because of leap days.)  Some years are
   longer than others by a second (because of leap seconds).  Some days or
   months are longer or shorter than others depending on your Daylight Saving
   / Summer Time rules!  For example, in the "US/Mountain" timezone, the month
   of March, 2019 is only 30 days, 23 hours long, not 31 days!  Similarly,
   November, 2019 is 31 days, 1 hour long!  In another timezone, it may be
   exactly 31 days!  Some days are 25 hours long, while others are 23 hours
   long!  Yay calendars!
  beginPlusOffset[, , , ]
     Returns a date/time corresponding to the beginning of the specific
      timestep (e.g. year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond) and
      (optionally) allows you to increment or decrement that timestep by an
      integer amount.  The parameters are:

      :  A date/time indicating an instance in time.
        
       : One of the constants in Calendar.fields that
        indicates which field we're going to increment.  This is limited to
        the following: Calendar.YEAR, Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH,
        Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, Calendar.MINUTE, Calendar.SECOND,
        Calendar.MILLISECOND.  This field also controls the timestep we're
        finding the beginning of.  For example, if called with Calendar.YEAR,
        the initial time calculated will be the beginning of the calendar year
        that contains .  The field constants can be obtained
        by something like:

        staticJava["java.util.Calendar", "MONTH"] An integer to offset the specified field by.
         This may be positive, negative, or zero, but it must fit into a
         signed 32-bit int due to restrictions in the Java API.

         
          For example,
          if  is  and 
           is , this function returns a
          date/time corresponding to the beginning of the calendar year that
          contains .
         
          If  is , this function returns
          a date/time corresponding to the beginning of the 
          calendar year after the year that contains .
          Similarly, if  is , this returns
          the beginning of the  year.
         : A string indicating the timezone of the result.
         If this is the special/default value , we use the
         system's default timezone.
      
       This is a highly general function.  There are some convenience
       functions for common cases listed below.
      
        beginningOfYearPlus[,,]
        beginningOfMonthPlus[,,]
        beginningOfDayPlus[,,]
        beginningOfHourPlus[,,]
        beginningOfMinutePlus[,,]
        beginningOfSecondPlus[,,]
        beginningOfMillisecondPlus[,,]
        
      These are convenience methods for the 
        function above.  Returns a date/time corresponding to the beginning of
        the specific timestep (e.g. year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
        millisecond) and (optionally) allows you to increment or decrement
        that timestep by an integer amount.  The parameters are:

      :  A date/time indicating an instance in time.

        An integer to offset the specified field by.
        This may be positive, negative, or zero, but it must fit into a
        signed 32-bit int due to restrictions in the Java API.

        
         For example,
         if  is  and 
          is , this function returns a
         date/time corresponding to the beginning of the calendar year that
         contains .
        
         If  is , this function returns
         a date/time corresponding to the beginning of the 
         calendar year after the year that contains .
         Similarly, if  is , this returns
         the beginning of the  year.
        : A string indicating the timezone of the result.
         If this is the special/default value , we use the
         system's default timezone.
      
        beginningOfYear[,]
        beginningOfMonth[,]
        beginningOfDay[,]
        beginningOfHour[,]
        beginningOfMinute[,]
        beginningOfSecond[,]
        beginningOfMillisecond[,]Returns the beginning of the timestep
        containing , e.g. the beginning of the year or month.
        The timezone should be a string.
        If the timezone contains the special/default value ,
        this uses the system's default timezone.

      
        beginningOfNextYear[,]
        beginningOfNextMonth[,]
        beginningOfNextDay[,]
        beginningOfNextHour[,]
        beginningOfNextMinute[,]
        beginningOfNextSecond[,]
        beginningOfNextMillisecond[,]Returns the beginning of the  timestep
        containing , e.g. the beginning of the next year or
        month.  The timezone should be a
        string.  If the timezone contains the special/default
        value , this uses the system's default timezone.

     
        beginningOfPreviousYear[,]
        beginningOfPreviousMonth[,]
        beginningOfPreviousDay[,]
        beginningOfPreviousHour[,]
        beginningOfPreviousMinute[,]
        beginningOfPreviousSecond[,]
        beginningOfPreviousMillisecond[,]Returns the beginning of the  timestep
        containing , e.g. the beginning of the previous year or
        month.  The timezone should be a
        string.  If the timezone contains the special/default
        value , this uses the system's default timezone.
        
     
       lengthOfYear[,]
       lengthOfMonth[,]
       lengthOfDay[,]
      Returns the length of the (year, month, or day)
       containing .  This function does not correct for leap
       seconds, but see the functions below if you need this.
       The timezone should be a string.
       If the timezone contains the special/default value ,
       this uses the system's default timezone.

       
        The result is a unit with dimensions of time that can be added to
        dates, divided into days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.
       
        Note that this may produce surprising results!  Under some timezone
        rules, some days (and months) may be an hour longer or shorter than
        you expect due to Daylight Saving / Summer Time rules!  For example,
        in most US timezones, March is one hour shorter than 31 days because
        the clocks are set forward one hour (at 2:00 AM on the second Sunday
        of March)!  In other timezones, (like UTC) this shift may not
        occur.  Handling the varying lengths is necessary for consistency in
        date/time math.
       
        The following demonstrates the calendar correction due to Daylight
        Saving time in March, 2019 in the US/Mountain timezone.
       lengthOfMonth[#2019-03 US/Mountain#, "US/Mountain"] -> ["days","hours"]
       lengthOfYearLeap[,]
       lengthOfMonthLeap[,]
       lengthOfDayLeap[,]
      Returns the length of the (year, month, or day)
       containing .  These functions are identical to the
       functions above with the exception that they do correct for
        leap seconds.
        The following demonstrates the leap second added at the end of 2016
        (which was also a leap year):
       lengthOfYearLeap[#2016#] -> ["days","hours","min","sec"]366 days, 0 hours, 0 min, 1 sec
   The following sample demonstrates iterating through the beginning of
   months, starting from the beginning of "this year" (for any value of "this
   year") and continuing to the end of "next year".
  date = beginningOfYear[now[]]
    enddate = beginningOfYearPlus[date, 2]
    {
   date = beginningOfNextMonth[date]
   Lest you think this is simpler than it is, these functions also handle
   historical transformations like the switch between the Julian and Gregorian
   calendar in the year 1582 in which 10 days were removed from the calendar
   (but we kept the days of the week.)
  a = #1582-10#
    b = beginningOfNextMonth[a]
   println[a = beginningOfNextDay[a] -> ###yyyy-MM-dd EEE###]
    1582-10-02 Tue
    1582-10-03 Wed  (Note the 10 day calendar offset which Frink handles correctly)
    1582-10-15 Fri
    1582-10-17 Sun  The following notes apply to Frink release 2008-08-02 and
   later.  Previous releases may have handled the transition between Julian
   and Gregorian dates and large BC years inconsistently.
  Frink models the switch between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
    This switch occurs between October 4, 1582 (Julian) which
    was followed immediately by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian).  However, you
    should be warned that many countries observed the switch from the Julian
    to the Gregorian calendar in later years. (As late as 1918 in Russia, or
    1923 for Greece.)  When reviewing historical dates, you need to verify and
    double-check your author's assumptions about dates and calendar systems.

   Dates prior to this switch date are parsed and displayed as their dates
    in the Julian calendar.

   Frink follows Julian leap year rules before the switch date (all years
    divisible by 4 are leap years) and Gregorian leap year rules after the
    switch (if a year is divisible by 100, it is only a leap year if it is
    also divisible by 400.  Otherwise, all other years divisible by 4 are leap
    years.)

   Parsing a date between the switch dates will result in undefined
    behavior.

   Julian date  (Julian) was preceded
    immediately by  (Julian).  There is no year
    0, and negative years are intentionally disallowed when parsing, as they
    are often treated inconsistently by authors and scholars.  Again, if you
    encounter a negative year in a publication, you need to examine your
    author's assumptions about years before AD 0001.
  
   If you want to enter date/time values in a specific format, you can enter
   new date formats on the fly.  Date formats are enclosed between sets of 3
   pound signs: .  After defining a new
   pattern, dates between pound signs should be recognized.  For readability,
   you may have leading or trailing space in your formats or dates.  For
   example:
  
   You can also define the default  format with 4 pound signs.
   Without a definition in the dateformats.txt file, you get the
   Java default (which should theoretically get it from your system's
   settings, or mine if you're using the web interface,) but for lots of info,
   try something like:
  #### G yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS a (E) zzzz ####
   Date format expressions can be assigned to variables and/or used on the
   right-hand side of a conversion operator (  ).  To output
   a date in a specified format, use something like:
  fmt = ### HH:mm ###
    now[] -> fmt
   If you want to format a date with both a specific format and a timezone,
   make the right-hand-side of the conversion operator into a 2-argument
   bracketed list with the first argument indicating the date format and the
   second a  indicating the timezone name:
  fmt = ### yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm a (E) zzzz ###
    # 2003-06-12 02:25 PM Mountain # -> [fmt, "Japan"]2003-06-13 05:25 AM (Fri) Japan Standard Time
   In these patterns, all ASCII letters are reserved as pattern letters,
   which are defined as the following:
  1996
      (Please don't use 2-digit years.  It's just wrong.  Always
       use . This will still work for years like 12 AD.  Fix
       your data source if you can.)July & 07 (See below.  3 or more: use text, otherwise use
       number.)978
        Due to bugs/features in Java's
       java.date.SimpleDateParser class, you should only use a single
        in patterns, (which will match up to 3 digits) 
       because if you have an  specifier but just pass,
       say,  for the milliseconds, Java will parse that as
        for some insane reason!
      day number in week (1=Monday, ... 7=Sunday)For use in output specifications only:
    Pacific
      Standard Time, PST, GMT-08:00 ( through 
      will usually give you the short form like  while
       or longer will give you the full name like
      )
      
   The count of pattern letters determine the format:
  4 or more pattern letters: use full form,
      less than 4: use short or abbreviated form if one exists.

    The minimum number of digits. Shorter
      numbers are zero-padded to this amount. Year is handled specially;
      that is, if the count of  is 2, the year will be truncated
      to 2 digits.

       However, don't ever use truncated 2-digit years in
       input or output.  It's simply wrong and ambiguous and causes parsing
       problems.  Fix your data source if you can.  Did we learn nothing from
       Y2K?  When using 2-digit years, it's often impossible for a
        to reliably guess which format is intended, so obviously
       Frink can't guess right either.
      3 or more: use text, otherwise use number.
      
      If there are 4 or more "z"
      characters in a row, use the full name of the timezone, otherwise use
      the (usually 3-character) abbreviation.

         Timezone specifiers are not necessary in a date
       format and should not be used when specifying an input format string.
       Timezones will always be allowed at the end of any date literal.
  
   Internally, all dates are represented as the Julian Day (which is
   essentially just a numeric value indicating the number of days and
   fractions of days since Julian Day 0, which began at noon UTC on January 1,
   4713 B.C. as reckoned on the Julian Calendar.  Yes,  is the
   beginning of the day in the Julian Day system.)  So noon UTC on September
   10, 2001 is JD 2452163.0.
  
   Julian Day (JD) and Modified Julian Day (MJD) can also be parsed.  MJD is
   defined as Julian Day - 2400000.5.  Note that  is the start
   of a  Julian Day.
  
   Many astronomical calculations use Julian Day (Ephemeris), usually
   abbreviated JDE, which is Julian Day with reference to Dynamical Time, not Universal Coordinated Time
   (UTC).  This can be parsed using the prefix :
  # JD [212263942933679/86400000,
     70754647644893/28800000] #
   You can also use the JDE function to convert a number to the corresponding
   Julian Day Ephemeris value:
  AD 2000-01-01 04:58:56.170 AM (Sat) Mountain Standard Time Do not confuse the Julian Day, (which is a single continuous
   numbering system often used by astronomers, who like the day number to
   change at noon when they're not working,) with a date in the Julian
   Calendar, which is almost identical to the Gregorian Calendar we use today,
   except without the centuries-divisible-by-400 leap-year rules.  (The
   differences are deeper, but that's the big one.)
  
   Dynamical Time is a time system that adjusts for the varying rotation rate
   of the earth!  This is one of the most accurate time systems and is
   necessary for calculating astronomical events to high accuracy in the past,
   present, and future.
  
   The offset ΔT between UTC and Dynamical Time
   (that is, the time that must be  to UTC to get Dynamical
   Time) can be obtained by the function:
  
   You usually won't use this directly, but instead parse dates in Dynamical
   Time by appending the  or 
   timezone specifiers when parsing a date.  The  (Julian Date Ephemeris) format is
   also referenced to Dynamical Time.  For example, the time represented by
   the Dynamical Time at the year 2000 epoch is:
  epoch = # 2000-01-01 00:00 TD #
   Internally, all times are represented as the Julian Day referenced to UTC,
   but can be displayed in Dynamical Time if you specify Dynamical Time as the
   timezone on the right-hand-side of the conversion operator:
  # 2003-10-10 11:26 PM Mountain # -> TDAD 2003-10-11 05:27:04.184 AM (Sat) GMT+00:01
   International Atomic Time (TAI) is a system of time based on the "proper
   time" on earth's geoid.  While dates and times in Frink are internally
   represented as a Julian day referenced to UTC, you can convert between UTC
   and TAI for any given date using the function
    which returns the value TAI-UTC.
   This is the cumulative number of leap seconds that have been introduced
   into the calendar.
  TAIMinusUTC[# 2008-12-01 00:00 UTC#]
   This facility allows you to adjust for leap seconds, as TAI does not use
   leap seconds, but UTC does.  For more information on handling leap seconds,
   read on.
  
   By default, Frink's date/time math (using the  and
    operators)  does  correct for leap
   seconds, but it can track leap seconds when requested.  The following
   functions add and subtract dates, taking leap seconds into account:
  Adds the
      specified offset (given as a time) to the specified date, taking leap
      seconds into account.  This is equivalent to:
      date + offset + TAIMinusUTC[date] - TAIMinusUTC[date+offset]
       subtractLeap[, ]Returns
      date2-date1 with leap seconds taken into account. (d2 is normally the
      later date.)  This returns a time interval between the dates. This is
      equivalent to: 
      date2 - date1 + TAIMinusUTC[date2] - TAIMinusUTC[date1]
       
   For example, to find the exact time between two dates nominally a year
   apart:
  
    d1 = # 2008-12-01 00:00 UTC #
    d2 = # 2009-12-01 00:00 UTC #
    diff = subtractLeap[d2,d1]
    diff -> ["days", "s"]
   Note that the duration is slightly longer due to the leap second being
   introduced at the end of 2008.
  
   Or, to add a specified duration to a date:
  
    addLeap[d1, 365 days] -> UTCAD 2009-11-30 PM 11:59:59.000 (Mon) Coordinated Universal Time
   The functions lengthOfYearLeap, lengthOfMonthLeap,
   lengthOfDayLeap also calculate the length of years, months, days,
   etc.,
   with leap seconds taken into account.  See
   the Calendar Functions section of the
   documentation for their use.
  
   Note that the resulting time is one second earlier than without leap
   seconds, due to the leap second introduced at the end of 2008.  Note that
   the exact second of the resultant date/time value is undefined on the leap
   second boundary (which this calculation includes.)  Frink does 
   represent the leap second as something like .
  
   Modern leap seconds were first introduced on
   1972 January 1, where the value of TAI-UTC became exactly 10 seconds, and
   leap seconds have been introduced at irregular intervals since then.  Leap
   seconds may be added just before January 1 or July 1 of each year.
  
   It should be noted that from 1961 January 1 to 1972 January 1, instead of
   introducing discrete leap seconds, you had to do linear interpolation to
   convert between TAI and UTC.  Be warned that Frink follows this
   interpolation process between these dates, and the value of UTC-TAI will
   not be an integer during this period! Before 1961 Jan 1, this function
   returns 0 seconds.  For dates after the last known leap second is
   introduced, this function will return the value of TAI-UTC for the
   last-published leap second ( 37 seconds after 2017-01-01.)
  
   The  timezone specifier can be used to convert to/from
   International Atomic Time:
  
   Converting a UTC time to TAI:
  
    d1 = # 2017-11-01 00:00 UTC #
    d1 -> TAIAD 2017-11-01 AM 12:00:37.000 (Wed) International Atomic Time
   Converting a TAI time to UTC:
  
    d2 = # 2017-11-01 00:00 TAI #
    d2 -> UTCAD 2017-10-31 PM 11:59:23.000 (Tue) Coordinated Universal TimeAdditional conversions between time systems can be performed using the
   following relations:
  Terrestrial Time/Dynamical Time: TT = TAI + 32.184 seconds
    (Terrestrial Time is a more modern name for Dynamical Time.  See
     Dynamical Time section above.) GPS = TAI - 19 s
  
   Regular expressions allow you to match complex patterns in strings.  Frink
   matches most all of the regular expressions matched by Perl, and most
   regular expressions are portable between languages like Perl, Ruby, Python,
   Frink, etc.  Frink internally uses the OROMatcher regular expression
   library, which attempts to match as much of Perl 5's syntax as possible.
  
   If a pattern matches, it returns an array (possibly empty) of all of the
   "saved" matches inside parentheses.  If a pattern does  match,
   it returns the value .  Since any array (even an empty
   named one) is treated as a  value, and 
   is treated as  (see the Truth
   section of the documentation,) this makes it easy to test within an
    statement:
  
   for line = lines["https://frinklang.org/"]
      if [email] = line =~ %r/(\w+@\w+\.\w+)/
         println["Matched email $email"]
   
   (Since a matched pattern always returns an array of values, putting
    in square brackets assigns the result, as a single
   string, to the variable named .  Without the brackets, it
   would assign  to the variable .)
  
   The matching syntax is similar to Perl or Ruby, with the exception that the
   pattern is denoted by  as
   below:
  
   line = "New Zealand"
   if line =~ %r/Alan/i   
      println["Matched"]
   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the string.
   If you need to build up a variable regular expression from a string, use
   the  or  functions.  The sample below is identical to the
   sample above:
  
    line = "New Zealand"
    re = regex["Alan", "i"]
       println["Matched"]
   Any part of the pattern surrounded by parentheses are saved off and
   returned as an  (even if only one item is returned.)  There
   aren't shortcut ... variables like in Perl, and probably
   never will be, as it's too easy to break code without knowing it.
  
   The usual idiom is to get return values by breaking apart the array that is
   returned:
  
   line = "My name is Inigo Montoya."
   if [first, last] = line =~ %r/my name is (\w+) (\w+)/i
   {
      println["First name is: $first"]
      println["Last  name is: $last"]
   If you don't assign the results to an array in square brackets (even a
   single-element array,) all matching results are assigned as an array to a
   single variable:

  
   line = "My name is Inigo Montoya."
   results = line =~ %r/my name is (\w+) (\w+)/i
   if results
      println["First name is: " + results@0]
      println["Last  name is: " + results@1]
   }
   
   If the  modifier is used at the end of the pattern,
   (indicating return  times matched, not just the first,) this
   will return an enumerating expression of the items matched, and you should
   change the  statement to a  statement:
  
   line = "My name is Inigo Montoya."
   for [first, last] = line =~ %r/my name is (\w+) (\w+)/ig
   {
      println["First name is: $first"]
      println["Last  name is: $last"]
   See the Iterating Matches section of the
    documentation below for more ways to handle this case.
  
   This section is a quick tutorial on the parts that create a regular
   expression.

      only.)
    Character class (with range), matches any
      uppercase character from A to Z inclusive.  (Once only)
    Character class (with multiple
      ranges), matches any character from A to F  any character
      from a to f, or any digit from 0 to 9 or the underscore character.
     character class:  matches
      any character  those from A to Z.
    Quote the next metacharacter.  Necessary if you
      want to, say, match a literal character in this table (such as periods,
      parentheses, question marks, etc.)
    Match any character (except newline).  To match a
      literal period, you must write   If the 
      (single-line) modifier is used in
      the search, this will also match the newline.
    Match the beginning of the string
    Match the end of the string
    Save the matched text contained in the
      parentheses and return it.
    Grouping only: allows grouping
      but does not save the result.
    A zero-width positive look-ahead
      match.  For example,  matches a word followed by
      an exclamation point,  including the exclamation point in
      the results, and without consuming the exclamation point.
    Matches patterns that  the pattern.  This is a zero-width look-ahead match, so it
      never has any width by itself.  For example,  will
      match  because  is followed by a character
      that is not , (), and the zero-width
      look-ahead match is followed by a .  See the documentation
      for the  function for a sample
      of its use.
    An embedded comment, which is
      ignored.
  
   The following characters classes are available.  They are all
   Unicode-aware: for example, the  will match a Sanskrit or
   Devanagari digit as well.
  
   Note that a capitalized letter usually matches the inverse of a lowercase
   letter.  For example,  matches a digit, while
    matches a non-digit.
  Match a "word" character (alphanumeric plus "_")
   Match a non-"word" character (see above)
   Match a whitespace character
   Match a non-whitespace character
   Backreference to an already-matched
      pattern (contained in parentheses.)
   Match except at a word boundary
   Match at beginning of string
   Match the specified Unicode character,
     where  is a 4-digit hexadecimal code indicating
     a Unicode codepoint.
   Match the specified Unicode
     character, where  is a 1-to-6 digit hexadecimal
     code indicating a Unicode codepoint.
   Match the specified Unicode
     character, where  is a 1-to-6 digit hexadecimal
     code indicating a Unicode codepoint.
   Match the specified character,
     where  is a 2-digit hexadecimal code indicating a
     Unicode codepoint.
  
   The following Unicode/POSIX character classes are available.  They are
   written as  or its negation .
   They must always be used inside a character class expression
   surrounded by square brackets , which means that you'll
   usually see the brackets doubled:
  Any alphabetical character.
   Any alphanumerical character.
   Any character in the ASCII character set.
   A GNU extension, equal to a space or a horizontal tab
   Any decimal digit, equivalent to "\d".
   Any printable character, excluding a space.
   Any printable character, including a space.
   Any graphical character excluding "word" characters.
   Any whitespace character. "\s" plus vertical tab ("\cK").
   
   The following symbols modify the pattern immediately previous to it, and
   allow you to specify that a pattern is matched multiple times:
  Match at least n but not more than m times
    Match 0 or more times, not greedily
    Match 1 or more times, not greedily
    Match 0 or 1 times, not greedily
    Match exactly n times, not greedily
    Match at least n times, not greedily
    Match at least n but not more than m times,
      not greedily
  
   Zero or more of these modifiers may follow the trailing  of a
   pattern match, and affect the behavior of the match, for example:
  Case-sensitive pattern-matching.
      Normally patterns are case-sensitive.
      
    Global matching.  Normally, a pattern only
      matches the first time it is encountered in a string.  This forces the
      pattern to match as many times as it occurs, requiring a loop.  See the
      Iterating Matches section below for more
      information.

    Treat string as multiple lines.  This means that
       and  change from matching the start of the
      string to matching the start or end of any line anywhere in the string.

    Treat string as a single line.  This means that
      the period character "" will match any possible character,
       the newline (which it doesn't match otherwise.)

    Extended pattern:  Allows pattern to include
      whitespace, newlines and comments.  Comments must begin with the
       character!

      
        %r/my name is\s+           # Phrase followed by 1 or more space characters
           (\w+)    # First name is all word characters
           \s+        # One or more spaces
           (\w+)    # Last name is all word characters
   Repeating regular expression matches (those with the 
   modifier) can be used in an enumerating context ( in a
    loop,) in which case each pass through the loop will
   return a match.  The following returns:
  
   for [email] = read["https://frinklang.org/"] =~ %r/(\w+@(?:\w|\.)+\.\w+)/g
      println[email]
    eliasen@mindspring.com
    eliasen@mindspring.com
   
   (The above URL contains the e-mail address twice.)  Note that pattern
   matches always return a  of values, (even if only one item is
   returned,) so to get only the first match, the variable 
   must be placed in square brackets.
  
   If used in a non-enumerating context (such as simple assignment,) the match
   will return a list-of-lists:
  
    list = read["http://futureboy.us/"] =~ %r/(\w+@(?:\w|\.)+\.\w+)/g
    println[list]
    [[eliasen@mindspring.com], [eliasen@mindspring.com]]
   
   This list can be flattened with the 
   function:
  
    [eliasen@mindspring.com, eliasen@mindspring.com]
   
   A Perl-like search-and-replace operator also exists.  The syntax is:
  line =~
    %s///
   If the expression on the left-hand-side of  is assignable,
   it will be modified in-place.  The following fixes a spelling mistake:
  
   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the
    string.  If you need to build up a variable replacement
   expression from a string, use the  or subst[, ,
    ] 
   functions.  Note that these  actually perform the
   substitution, but create an object that can be used later to perform the
   substitution.  The sample below is identical to the sample above:
  
    fromStr = "Frank"
    rep = subst[fromStr, "Frink", "g"]
   You can even use the Perl 5 behavior of replacing parenthesized parts of an
   expression.  The first parenthesized pattern on the left-hand side can be
   denoted by  in the replacement, the second by
    and so on.  For example, to change a file with names like
   "Frink, John" to "John Frink":
  
    line =~ %s/(\w+), (\w+)/$2 $1/
   
   You can't use  and  outside of the pattern
   match, like you can in Perl, though.  Another difference from Perl is that
   the return value of a search-and-replace is the replaced string, and not
   the number of times replaced.  This may change.
  
   If the  modifier exists on a search-and-replace operation,
   the right-hand-side of the substitution is treated as an expression.  The
   values saved on the left-hand side in parentheses are put into the
   variables  ,  , etc.  (Note that these
   variables are only available in the right-hand side of the
   substitution!)
  
   The following sample increments every integer it finds in the line.
  
    "There are 3 lights.  My ship is the NCC-1701-D." =~ %s/(\d+)/eval[$1]+1/eg
   
    There are 4 lights.  My ship is the NCC-1702-D.
   
   Frink has a useful file/URL input function called
    which reads lines one at a time from the
   specified URL or .  The URL can be an HTTP,
   file, or FTP URL.  It is best used with the  loop.  For example, to fetch and
   display the contents of a web page:
  
   for line = lines["https://frinklang.org/"]
      println[line] 
   
   By default, the  function returns an
   enumerating expression which returns each line as requested, and forgets
   about previous lines.  If you want to store each line in an array for later
   use, use the  function:
  
    a = array[ lines["file:data/units.txt"] ]
    println["The data file contains " + length[a] + " lines."]
   
   Hint:  You can use the 
    function to turn a filename into a correctly-escaped URL, even if it has
    spaces or weird punctuation in it.
  
   If the first argument is the special string , then the
   function will return an enumeration which reads lines from standard input
   (stdin) one at a time.  The following implements a simple "echo" program:
  
    for line = lines["-"]
       println[line]
   
   Or, a simple program to read in and sort the lines from standard input, and
   print them back out:
  
    println[joinln[sort[lines["-"]]]]
   
   The argument to the function may also be a 
   or a  which simplifies reading from other input
   streams (for example, reading from a  or an
   external process, or a pipe.)  See
   the Compressing/Decompressing
   Files section of the documentation on how to use functions like
    to decompress files while reading them.
  
   If you're carefree and have lots of memory, you can load the entire
   contents of an URL (again, file, HTTP, or FTP URL),
   a , or a ,
   a  or a  into
   a single big honkin' string using the 
   function: 
  
    bigstring = read["https://frinklang.org/"]
   
   The  function can also take
   a , or a ,
   a  or a  as an
   argument.
  
   If the argument is a string, note that this function expects a URL, so to
   open a file, you must provide an absolute or relative file URL beginning
   with 
    bigstring = read["file:///absolute/path/to/file"]
   
    bigstring = read["file:relative.html"]
   
   Hint:  You can use the 
    function to turn a filename into a correctly-escaped URL, even if it has
    spaces or weird punctuation in it.
  
   The  functions will read the contents
   of an entire URL, , or
   a , a  or
   a  into an array with one line per entry.
  
    array = readLines["https://frinklang.org/"]
   
   Note that the same result could be achieved by calling
  
    array[lines["https://frinklang.org/"]]
   
   Needless to say, this may use up large amounts of memory.
  
   If the string is the special value  these functions will
   read all the data passed to standard input (stdin) in one fell swoop.  For
   example, the following implements a simple "echo" program:
  
   The argument to the  and  functions
   may also be
   a , , or
   a  or a  which simplifies
   the manipulation of other input streams (for example, reading from
   a  or an external process, or a pipe.  See
   the Compressing/Decompressing
   Files section of the documentation on how to use functions like
    to decompress files while reading them.
  
   See the next section for information about specifying the encoding of the
   file.
  
   You can also read the contents of a URL (which may be a file) to an array
   of  by calling .
  
   The functions  and 
   and  that take a URL
   or  will attempt to set the character
   encoding correctly based on the
    HTTP header.  If you are not requesting an HTTP
   URL, or the encoding is not properly specified, or not set in the HTTP
   headers, these functions will use your system's default character encoding.
   If the default charset is not appropriate for a file or URL, you can
   explicitly specify the character encoding of the file using the
   two-argument versions of the above functions:
  lines[, ]
    read[, ]
   The encoding is a string representing any character encoding that your
   version of Java supports, ,
   , , ,
   , .  Your release of Java may
   support more charsets, but all implementations of Java are required to
   support the above.  Check the release notes for your Java implementation to
   see if other charsets are supported.
  
   In addition, see the sample program  
   encodings.frink which
   demonstrates how to list all of the encodings available on your system (and
   their aliases.)
  
   Text files can be written with the  class.  For example:
  
    w = new Writer["filename.txt"]
    w.print[2]
    w.close[]
   The  class can write out any Unicode text properly in
   the encoding that you specify (or your system's default encoding, if you
   don't specify an encoding.)  You can also read in files in one encoding and
   translate them to another encoding.
  
   For example, the following simple program reads in a file in the UTF-8
   encoding and writes it out in the UTF-16 encoding (or you can use it to
   convert between any encodings that your Java Virtual Machine supports):
  
    w = new Writer["outfile.txt", "UTF-16"]
    w.print[read["file:infile.txt", "UTF-8"]]
   Note that calling any of the constructors below immediately checks
   permissions and opens the file if allowed.  Your operating system may only
   allow one process to open a file for writing at a time.
  Constructs a
       that opens and will write to the specified filename
      using the operating system's default encoding.
      
    new
      Writer[,]Constructs a
       that opens and will write to the specified filename
      using the specified encoding, for example   See Specifying Alternate Encodings
      for information about supported encodings.
      
    new
      Writer[,,]Constructs a
       that opens and will write to the specified filename
      using the specified encoding.  If the encoding is 
      this will use the operating system's default encoding.
       is a boolean value which is  if you
      want to append to the file,  to overwrite it if it
      exists.
      
    new
      Writer[,,,]Constructs
       a  that opens and will write to the specified

        if you want to append to the file, 
       to overwrite it if it exists.  is the size of
       the internal buffer to use in bytes, and must be greater than 0.
       
      
       If you specify a buffer size, the file will not be automatically
       flushed after each  (which is the default
       behavior,) so you must remember to close or flush the file before it
       will all be written.  (This is to let you squeeze out a bit more
       performance.)  Note that if the program is interrupted or exits before
       you call the  method, your changes will not be
       guaranteed to be written!  If you use this constructor, it is
       recommended to wrap the code in a  block and call
        in the  block.
     
       If no buffer is specified, the file will be flushed after every
        or .
      new Writer[]Constructs a
       that wraps the already-opened
       using its already-set encoding.

    new Writer[]Constructs
      a  wraps the already-opened
       using the operating system's default
      encoding.
      
    new
      Writer[,]Constructs a
       wraps the already-opened
       
      using the specified encoding, for example .  See Specifying Alternate Encodings
      for information about supported encodings.
  
   After successful construction of a , you may call the
   following methods.
  write[]print[]
     Writes the specified expression to the file.  Both methods are
      identical.
    writeln[]println[] 
     Writes the specified expression to the file and adds a trailing
      newline.  If no buffer has been specified in the constructor, this also
      flushes the output.
    Simply appends a newline to the file.  If no buffer has been
      specified in the constructor, this also flushes the output.
    writeAndClose[]printAndClose[]
     Writes the specified expression to the file and then closes the file.
      Both methods are identical.  This is useful for a one-liner that writes
      an expression to a file.
    Flushes any buffered output to the
      underlying device.
    Closes the file, flushing any buffered
      output first.  No more writing is possible after calling this method.
      Don't forget to close your files, or your output is
       not guaranteed to be written!
   If you need to use some more complicated file I/O classes, such as for
   random I/O or writing raw bytes, you can use Frink's Java Introspection facilities to access
   Java's wide variety of I/O classes, even ones that I haven't conceived of
   yet. See Writer.frink
   for a simple example.  More classes for lower-level I/O may be
   forthcoming.  Suggestions are welcome.
  
   You can read and write to GZIP-compressed files without first compressing or
   decompressing them on the disk.  Files can be compressed or decompressed
   in memory while reading or writing to/from the disk.
  Opens the URL (specified as a string)
    and returns a java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream that
    decompresses the contents of the URL.  This can be passed to functions
    that take a  such as 
    and .

    gunzip[]Returns a java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream that
    decompresses the specified .  This can be passed
    to functions that take a  such as
     and .

    gzip[]
   For example, to write to a compressed file:
  file = "compressed.txt.gz"
    out = new Writer[gzip[file]]
    out.println["Knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting"]
    out.println["and knitting and knitting and knitting..."]
   And to read back the contents of the above compressed file:
  file = "compressed.txt.gz"
    url = filenameToURL[file]
    println[read[gunzip[url]]]
   for line = lines[gunzip["file:compressed.txt.gz"]]
       println[line]
   
   These files can be read/written using standard  and
    tools on your operating system.
  
   If you want to compress data entirely in memory without reading or writing
   to a file, see
   the gzipMemory.frink
   sample file.
  
   The following sample uses regular
    expression matching to harvest things that look like e-mail addresses
   from any URL.  The combination of the  loop and the
    modifier allows multiple matches to be found in a single
   line.
  
    url = input["Enter a URL: "]
       for [result] = line =~ %r/(\w+@(?:\w|\.)+\.\w+)/g
   Pretty easy, eh?  Now you see why you get so much spam e-mail.  It's easy
   to grab e-mail addresses from files or Web pages.  Using this capability,
   Frink can be made to grab any kind of data from other web pages easily.
  
   Note that pattern matches always return a  of values, (even if
   only one item is returned,) so to get only the first match, the variable
    must be placed in square brackets.
  
   The following (ridiculously simple) function fetches the contents of any
   URL and (somewhat naïvely) strips out the HTML markup.
  
    stripHTML[url] := read[url] =~ %s/<[^>]*>//gs
   
   Frink provides a few functions which are useful for manipulating URLs and
   producing web-spiders:
   returns a new string URL
   made up of the given base and relative parts of a URL.  This is useful in
   resolving relative URLs in an HTML document:
  url["http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/index.html", "whatsnew.html"]http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html returns a string indicating the
   hostname of a specifed URL string (e.g. , or
   an empty string if no host is specified.)
   returns a string indicating the
   entire path of a specifed URL string,
   (e.g. "http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html" will 
   return "/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html")
   returns a string indicating the
   filename of a specifed URL string, that is the last path part of a URL
   (e.g. "http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html" will
   return )
  URLEncode[]
   encodes a string for use as part of a URL.  The encoding should probably be
   the string  for most applications.
  URLDecode[]
   decodes a string for use as part of a URL.  The encoding should probably be
   the string  for most applications.
   returns a string indicating the
   protocol (e.g.,  of a given URL string.)
   turns a string containing
   a filename into a URL string.
   takes a string representing a
   file or directory and returns an enumeration of files in that directory.
   Each string is the URL of a file in that directory.
  fileURLsRecursive[string] takes a string
   representing a file or directory and returns an enumeration of files in that
   directory and all its subdirectories.  Each string is the URL of a
   file in that directory.
  
   The following program resolves all of the relative URLs in an HTML
   document and prints their values.
  
    url = input["Enter a URL: "]
    println[joinln[findURLs[url]]]
    {
       for [rel] read[u] =~ %r/<\s*A\s+[^>]*HREF\s*=\s*"([^ "]+)"/gsi
          results.push[url[u, rel]]
    }
   
    The following functions are for other input/output routines.
  copyStream[, ]Copies
        the contents of one  to
        a .  This closes both streams when
        complete.   This is actually a quite fundamental operation.  For
        example, it is used by
        the ZipFile.frink
        sample program to extract files from a zip file.  In addition, it can
        be used to download from a URL (by
        calling ,) copy files from one
        place to another, etc.
  
   In Frink, you can define blocks of executable code which can be assigned to
   variables, passed to and from functions, and executed as functions.  These
   work just like functions with no name.  In fact, that's exactly what they
   are.  The syntax is:
  
    These can be multi-line functions, too:
  { ||
         println[x+y]
    }
   The arguments in  are a (possibly empty)
   comma-separated list of variable names which are treated just like the
   formal parameters to a function.  The body is one or more statements or
   expressions to be executed.
  
   How is this useful?  Well, for example the  function can take an anonymous
   function as an argument to help it select items from a list.  See its
   documentation for more information.
  
   An anonymous function can be called as a function.  The current syntax looks
   just like a function call:
  
    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }
    isEven[4]
   You can also apply an anonymous function with
   the 
   function.   should be an array of arguments to the
   function.
  
    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }
    apply[isEven, [4]]
   As of the 2025-02-08 release, an anonymous function can be declared and
   immediately applied to its arguments by enclosing them in square brackets
   after the declaration.
  
   The following defines an anonymous function that
   squares its argument and immediately applies it with the
   argument .
  will sort lists in which the elements have
   the same type.  When sorting units, the units should be conformal (that is,
   all should have the same dimensions.)  It is important to note that the
   list will be sorted in-place, that is, the original list will be modified!
   To get around this, the array should first be copied with the  method.  If you want to do language-correct sorting of strings,
   especially for languages with accents, use the Lexical Sorting methods instead.  The default
    is designed to be simple and fast, but does not sort
   human languages according to their rules.
  
   The two-argument version  allows
   you to specify a user-defined comparison routine. The second argument is a
   (possibly anonymous) function which contains a user-defined comparison
   routine.  The comparison routine must take 2 arguments
   (say ) and return -1 if a is less than b, 0 if a==b, and
   1 if a is greater than b.  (These are the values returned by
   the three-way comparison
   operator,  )  The argument  may also
   be an .
   The following samples are equivalent:
  
    a = [5,2,3,1,4]
    cmp = { |a,b|  a <=> b }
   The default sort is much faster than if you define a user-defined
   comparison function (about 30 times faster in my tests!)  Now I see why
   Perl has so many anomalous and special-cased optimizations around
   user-defined sorting.
  
   If the  function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument  function which requires a three-argument comparison
   function to be passed to it, with the first two arguments being items to
   compare and the third argument being the arbitrary data.  The
   argument  may also be an .  For
   example, to sort a list by a specified column number:
  
    list = [[1, "c"], [2, "b"], [3, "a"]]
     cmpfunc = {|a, b, column| a@column <=> b@column}
     sort[list, cmpfunc, 1]
   If you always want to sort a multi-dimensional array by column number, you
   can get an appropriate sorting function that sorts by a specified column by
   calling  and passing that as a sorting
   function.  The column number is zero-based.  For example, the following
   simplifies the above example and sorts by column 1:
  
    list = [[1, "c"], [2, "b"], [3, "a"]]
    sort[list, byColumn[1]]
   If you need to sort by several columns (that is, if the first column
   compares equal, then sort by column 2, etc, you can get an appropriate
   sorting function by calling  and
   passing that as a sorting function.  The column numbers are
   an  and are zero-based.  For example, the following sorts by
   column 0 and then by column 1.
  
    list = [[1, "c"], [2, "b"], [1, "a"], [3, "d"]]
    sort[list, byColumns[[0,1]]][[1, a], [1, c], [2, b], [3, d]]
   If you want the elements in reverse order, you can reverse the sorted list
   by calling the  function on the sorted
   list.
  
   To sort all of the units with dimensions of time (or by extension, any
   dimension list) by their magnitude, you can use the following.  (Keep in
   mind that the  function returns the  of the
   units as strings.  The function  returns
   the unit with the specified name.:
  
    sort[units[time], { |a,b| unit[a] <=> unit[b] }]
   
    sort[unitsWithValues[time], byColumn[1]]
   
   The default  functions sort strings in a simple and fast
   way (according to the order of characters in Unicode,) but in a way
   that is likely not correct according to the sorting methods for most human
   languages.  To sort strings correctly,
    functions should be used.
  
   These functions understand alphabetization rules, Unicode normalization
   rules for characters with accents, alternate ways of specifying the same
   character, as well as the rules for most human languages and the way that
   their alphabetization rules differ.  They are very clever, and will make
   you look smart for using them correctly.
  
   The function  sorts an array of
   strings using the default language and locale settings defined in your Java
   Virtual Machine:
  
    a = ["ökonomisch", "offenbar", "olfaktorisch", "Arg", "Ärgerlich", "Arm", "Assistent", "Aßlar", "Assoziation", "eñe", "ene", "enne"]
    [Arg, Ärgerlich, Arm, Assistent, Aßlar, Assoziation, ene, eñe, enne, offenbar, ökonomisch, olfaktorisch]
   
   (Note that this was using an English locale, which also has good default
   rules that work correctly for other languages.)  Compare this to the order
   produced by the basic sort, which doesn't know anything about special
   characters:
  
    [Arg, Arm, Assistent, Assoziation, Aßlar, ene, enne, eñe, offenbar, olfaktorisch, Ärgerlich, ökonomisch]
   
   Which bears no resemblance to any alphabetical ordering that most human
   languages would expect.  The price is that lexical sorting is slower and
   more expensive.  But it's a small price for being right, and
   internationalization-capable.
  
   Note that the sorting order depends on  Java Virtual Machine's
   locale and language settings.  If you want to force sorting for a
   particular language, you can use the lexicalSort[,
    ] function to specify its language code using
   the ISO
    639-1 two-letter code for the language.  For example, repeating the
    above example for Turkish, whose language code is :
  
    [Arg, Arm, Assistent, Assoziation, Aßlar, Ärgerlich, ene, eñe, enne, offenbar, olfaktorisch, ökonomisch]
   
   (Note that, according to the rules of Turkish, the letter
    is treated as a separate character alphabetized after
   .  The same is true for  and
   .)
  
   Another example, using Danish and its possibly surprising alphabetization
   rules:
  
    a = ["Ærø", "Aalborg", "Tårnby", "Vejen", "Thisted", "Stevns", "Sønderborg"]
    
    lexicalSort[a, "da"]   
    [Stevns, Sønderborg, Thisted, Tårnby, Vejen, Ærø, Aalborg]
   
   That order is correct, with names beginning with "Aa" alphabetized last.
  
   If you need extreme control over the sorting order, the second argument of
   lexicalSort[, ] can be either a
   
   or a 
   object which allows you very detailed control over creating custom sorting
   rules or locales.  Please see the documentation for those classes for
   details on controlling sorting.
  
   You can also normalize strings containing Unicode characters into a
   "canonical" form.  See the 
   function for more information about this.
  
   If the values to be sorted by the  functions are
   not strings, they can still be sorted as long as they are comparable to
   each other.  The default sort order will be used when values are not
   strings.
  
   As of the 2024-07-11 release,  now compares
   sub-arrays also.  For example, in an array of arrays, 
   sorts before .  Shorter arrays sort before longer ones.
  
   This is all pretty cool and powerful, right?  Your programs can now
   demonstrate knowledge about many, many human languages and do the right
   thing with them!
  
   The following functions operate on all the elements of an array:
  
   The  function allows you to select the items from a list for
   which  returns .  For example, to select
   the even items from a list:
  
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    select[ array, { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 } ]
   This successively assigns each element of  to a new
   local variable , and returns the list of values for which
    equals zero.
  
   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of
   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function
   arguments.
  
   The following sample selects pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,
   do  contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the
   greatest common factor is 1.):
  
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]
    coprime = {|x,y| gcd[x,y] == 1}[[2, 3], [20, 3], [7, 25]] The second argument to  can also be a regular expression.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and returns all of the strings that match the
   regular expression.
   The second argument to  can also be a substring.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and returns items which
   contain the specified substring (with an exact match.)  If you need a
   case-insensitive match, the second argument should be a regular expression.
  
   If the  function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument 
   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with
   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary
   data.  For example, to select all the elements of a list that are greater
   a certain number (in the following case, 2):
  
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    select[ array, { |x, data|  x > data }, 2]
   Similarly, the three-argument  function that passes in
   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your
   selector function.
  
   The following example selects pairs whose product is larger than a specific
   number (in this case, 50).
  
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]
    product = {|x,y,data| x*y > data}
    select[array, product, 50]  As of the 2014-05-09 release, the
    and  functions now try
   harder to keep their return values as arrays if passed an array, and an
   enumerating expression if passed an
    enumerating expression.  In addition, they now keep dictionaries as
    dictionaries, OrderedLists as OrderedLists, and
    sets as sets.  To obtain other types, ,
    , and 
    functions.  If in doubt, use these functions directly to change the return
    types.)
   However,closing the results in a  loop will still work to enumerate
   through all contained objects, no matter what the return type is.)
  
   This makes these functions now work properly with infinite series, and work
   more responsively with long-running operations that return information
   periodically. ( searches.)  This change may also allow
   significantly-reduced memory consumption, as you can process each element
   and then forget about it, rather than holding on to a large array of
   values.
  
   The inverse of  is .  Read below.
  
   The inverse of the  function is 
   which works similarly to , but  all
   items from a list that match the condition.
  
   The  function allows you to remove the items from a list for
   which  returns .  For example, to remove
   the even items from a list:
  
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    remove[ array, { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 } ]
   This successively assigns each element of  to a new
   local variable , and removes all values for which
    equals zero.
  
   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of
   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function
   arguments.
  
   The following sample removes pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,
   do  contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the
   greatest common factor is 1.):
  
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]
    coprime = {|x,y| gcd[x,y] == 1} The second argument to  can also be a regular expression.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and removes all of the strings that match the
   regular expression, returning the items that did  match.
  
   For example, if you wanted to remove all filenames that contained the
   substring  from a list, you might have to write a
   somewhat complicated, non-obvious regular expression that does not match
   that pattern using select: 
  select[files,  %r/^(.(?!(CVS)))*$/]
   Or, more simply, use  and a simpler pattern that matches
   the strings we want to remove:
  
   If the  function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument 
   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with
   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary
   data.  For example, to remove all the elements of a list that match a
   certain number (in the following case, 2):
  
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    remove[ array, { |x, data|  x == data }, 2]
   Similarly, the three-argument  function that passes in
   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your
   selector function.
  
   The following example removes pairs whose product is larger than a specific
   number (in this case, 50).
  
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]
    product = {|x,y,data| x*y > data}
    remove[array, product, 50]
   The functions 
   and 
   and mapList[, , ] apply
   the specified function to all the members of a list, and returns a new list
   containing the results.  This is usually faster and more concise than
   applying a function to a list of arguments in a loop.
  
   There are two different, but similar functions:  
   and .  Here is how to choose the function you want:
  : If you want to write a function that takes multiple
    arguments,  helps you by splitting an array of arguments
    into named variables for easy use in your function.

   : If your function just wants to handle an array of
    values , without modification,
    use .  Normally, you provide a 
    function that receives the array.  If you use the three-argument version
    mapList[, , ], your
    function will have  arguments, .
  
   The  parameter may be either a string
   containing the name of the function or a function, possibly an anonymous function.
  
   If your list of arguments all have the same number of items, you can pass
   in the function name as a string:
  
    array = [0,1,4,9]
    map["sqrt", array]
   You may want to pass in a reference to the function itself as the first
   parameter.  You can do this by calling the getFunction[,
   ] function.  For example, to return the greatest
   common denominator of successive pairs of numbers, you might do the
   following:
  
    array = [[3,5], [2,10], [24, 36]]
    g = getFunction["gcd", 2]
    array = [1,2,3]
    double = {|a|  a*2 }
   Anonymous arrays with any number of arguments are allowed, as long as each
   element of your list is a list containing the right number of items.
  
   Currently, all elements of the list must have the same number of elements
   and will resolve to the same function call.
  
   If the number of items that will be passed to the function is greater than
   the number of formal arguments defined by the function, all of the extra
   arguments will be passed as an array to the last argument of the function.
   For example, if we define a function that only takes one argument, but pass
   it three items in each list, all three items will be passed as an array:
  
    concat = {|i| join["", i]}
    a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
   While this works in the above case, passing a one-argument array does not
   work correctly.  You need to use  in that case.
  
    concat = {|i| join["", i]}
    a = [[1],[4,5],[7,8,9]]Error when calling function println:
     Error when calling function map:
     Error when calling function join:
     Second argument to join must be a list.
   
   This is because the  function tries to "break up" the list
   and assign items from the list to named variables, and assigns any
   remaining items to the last variable of the function.  If you
   use  in this case, it works correctly.
  
    concat = {|i| join["", i]}
    a = [[1],[4,5],[7,8,9]]
   You can test what your function is receiving by replacing your function
   with something that just returns its value:
  
    echo = {|i| i}
    a = [[1],[4,5],[7,8,9]]
   As you can see, the first result  is not returned as an
   array.  Use  if you always want arrays handled as
   arrays, and not put into individual variables.
  
   If you need to pass additional data for the function to do its job, you can
   use the
   three-argument mapList[, , ]
   function.  The third argument,  is arbitrary data that
   will be passed to the second argument of  which must
   take two parameters, .
  
   The following returns  for all values that are greater
   than the threshold value passed in the variable .
  
    gt = {|list, data| list > data}
    a = [1,2,3,4][false, false, true, true]
   A string can be split into an array using the  function which splits the string into parts.  The first
   argument to the  function
   can be either a regular expression or a string containing the delimiter.
   Conversely, the elements of an array can be joined into a string with a
   fixed delimiter, using 
   Splitting a string into an array, splitting on whitespace (the pattern
    matches 1 or more whitespace characters:)
  array = split[ %r/\s+/, "1 2 3 4 5"]
   Or, to split a tab-delimited line into elements:
  array = split["\t", line]
   which is the same asarray = split[%r/\t/, line]
   A string can be split into lines on any newline characters
   (\r\n|\r|\n|\u2028|\u2029|\u000B|\u000C|\u0085) using
   the  function which returns an array of
   strings with the newlines removed.
  line = "One\nTwo\nThree"
    println[splitLines[line]]
   The reverse of 
   is  which joins multiple
   array elements into one string, with elements separated by the specified
   string.
  
   The single-argument function  joins array
   elements with no separator.  This is equivalent
   to 
   Returns a string where the elements of  are
   returned as a single string where the elements are separated by your
   platform's newline character(s).  That is, each element in the list are
   separated by newlines and probably printed on a line by itself.
  
   The inverse of 
   is  which takes a string and splits
   the string on newlines.
  
   The function  "zips" together
   corresponding elements of lists  and  and
   returns each pair as a two-element array.  (This is what this function is
   usually called in functional programming, and has nothing to do with the
   zip compression format.)  For example:
  
   If one list is longer than the other, the shorter list will be
   padded with  values.  If  arguments are
   enumerating expressions, the result will be an efficient enumerating
   expression.  Otherwise, the arguments will be converted to arrays and the
   result will be an array (which is potentially large.)  Also note that an
   array  an enumerating expression too!
  
   The results can be processed individually with the  loop:
  
    for a = zip[1 to million, 3 to million + 3]
       println[a]
   If you wish to pad with values other than , there is a
   4-argument version of the function zip[, ,
    , ] that specifies what values to pad
   each list with.
  
   The inverse of the  function is
   the  function below.
  
   The function  is the inverse of
   the  function and "unzips" the columns
   of a given enumerating expression
   (which can be an array) into seperate arrays and returns an array of
   arrays.  (This is what this function is usually called in functional
   programming, and has nothing to do with the zip compression format.)  (The
   return types are currently arrays, but this may change.)  For example, this
   inverts the list produced by the  function above and
   separates it into two arrays called  and .
  a = [ [1,6], [2,7], [3,8] ]
    [b,c] = unzip[a]
   For ease of maintenance, you can separate your program code into multiple
   files and include them in other files.  This is accomplished by the
    statement.  This includes the contents of the named file
   at compile-time, at the point where the  statement is
   encountered.  For example, to include a file called
    in the current directory:
  
   The  statement searches for the named files in the
   following places:
  Relative to the root of the current classpath or jar file.
    
   If the statement specifies a fully-qualified URL, the URL is loaded.
    This includes , , and
     URLs.
    
   Relative to the current file or URL being parsed.
    
   Relative to the current working directory.
    
   From the internal "standard library" shipped within the jar file's
     directory.  This location may change.
  
   The  statement has protection against including a file
   multiple times.
   If you're including a file that's  relative to any
   of the above, you'll need to specify it using an  URL, such as:
  use file:///c:/prog/frink/samples/sun.frink
   oruse file:///prog/frink/samples/sun.frink
   This is necessary because a file or relative URL can legitimately contain
   colons on some operating systems.  For example, on a UNIX-like system, you
   could have a subdirectory called  and that would be just
   fine.  Frink doesn't try to duplicate all the quirks of all operating
   systems and their wacky filename rules.
  
   Frink allows you to write your programs in object-oriented fashion,
   allowing complex data structures that are still easy to use.  Inheritance
   is not implemented, (and many people may argue that it shouldn't be
   implemented) but works fine for programs that don't require inheritance.
  
   Classes are defined using the  keyword and a syntax that
   won't particularly surprise anyone who has worked with Java, C++, Ruby,
   Python, or other object-oriented languages.
  
   The format of a class and how to use it is demonstrated in the 
   classtest.frink
   file.
  
   Interfaces are defined using the  keyword, and is
   similar to Java's implementation.
  
   Methods on an object can be listed using the
    function.  If  is an
   instance of an object, this lists the instance-level 
   class-level methods of that object.  If called with a classname (that gives
   you the "Metaclass Object" for that class,) it displays just the
   class-level methods.
  
   Frink has a  block which allows the programmer to
   ensure that code is called no matter what happens in a block of code.  The
   code within the  block is executed whether the block is
   exited from a  statement, or if an error occurs in the
   code, or whatever.
  
   If the body of the  or  block is a
   single line, it can be written without curly braces.
  
   Frink expressions can be formatted in a variety of formats.  There are
   currently different formatters for human-readable and machine-readable
   forms:
  : The default, human-friendly output format.
   : A machine-readable format, suitable for passing
    to Frink as input, and parsing with the  function.  This lets you
   easily save and load most Frink data structures (and programs,) send them
    over a network, etc., in a simple, safe and reversible
    way.   converts all ASCII characters outside the
    ASCII range 32-127 into escape codes, making it safe for use in a 7-bit
    ASCII pipeline.
   : A machine-readable format, suitable for passing
    to Frink as input, and parsing with the  function.  This
    assumes that you have a working Unicode environment and does not escape
    non-ASCII characters like  does.
  
   More formatters will follow, possibly for formatting into other languages
   (e.g. JavaScript/JSON).
  
   Several new functions have been added to support formatting in
   different formats:
  format[, ] formats the
    expression to a string using the specified formatter.  Current formatters
    include the strings 
    and .   is a formatter that
    provides Frink's input form that can be easily parsed by a call
    to .   is the
    human-friendly formatter, which has been greatly improved for the
    introduction of multiple formatters.
    
    lists the currently-available
    expression formatters.

   
    and 
    and inputFormUnicode[] are aliases
    for format[,"Input"]
    and format[,"Output"]
    and format[,"UnicodeInput"] respectively.
    
   Formatting options such as ,
    , , and
     and the  operator are
    now local to the , (and only affect the
     formatter,) not global to the entire Java Virtual
    Machine.  This makes it safer to embed multiple Frink parsers in a single
    virtual machine, each with their own preferences, and makes Java Server
    Pages more robust against poorly-behaved scripts.  (Programs still need
    to pass a security check to set these flags on an interpreter basis.)
  
   The  or format[,
    "Input"] function returns the expression in
   a machine-readable format, suitable for passing to Frink as input, and
   parsing with the 
   function.  This lets you easily save and load most Frink data structures
   (and programs,) send them over a network, etc., in a simple, safe and
   reversible way.
  
    a@"one" = 1
    a@"two" = 2
    [[one, 1], [three, 3], [two, 2]]  
    new dict[[["one", 1], ["three", 3], ["two", 2]]]Currently, objects created from a  specification will
    be output as a  with name-value pairs for all instance
    variables.  This may change.  This is currently done because there's no
    way to guarantee that the Frink interpreter on the other end has loaded
    the same  or a compatible version.  There are potential
    security and correctness issues if the classes are incompatible.  A
    malicious user could also modify the data to get around security or logic
    checks and create invalid or dangerous objects.  It's currently left up to
    the programmer to take these objects, validate their fields, and turn them
    back into the objects they want on the other end.  This may change.
    
   The Julian day parser can now parse rational numbers or date
    intervals, for example:
    # JD 212263942857555001/86400000000 ## JD [212263942933679/86400000, 70754647644893/28800000] #Java objects are not currently formatted usefully.  This may change,
    or not.
    
   When outputting dates in "input form", the date will be formatted as
    an exact Julian day (possibly an interval or an exact rational number as
    above) if necessary, or in a human-readable format in UTC, if
    sub-millisecond precision is not required, which allows exact round-trips
    of dates.

   Strings and identifiers (e.g. variable names, function names) will be
    encoded into an ASCII-safe form.  Characters outside the ASCII range will
    be escaped into ASCII-safe Unicode escapes.  If you have a Unicode-safe
    environment and want to preserve Unicode unmodified, use
    the inputFormUnicode formatter instead.

   Added  function to turn a string into
    a network and file-encoding safe ASCII-encoded equivalent.  This is
    useful if you don't want the full quoting of .

   Formatting options such as ,
    , , and
     and the  operator 
    do not apply in .
  
   The  or format[,
    "UnicodeInput"] function returns the expression in
   a machine-readable format, suitable for passing to Frink as input, and
   parsing with the 
   function.
  
   Unlike the  formatter described above, it
   does  escape Unicode characters outside the ASCII 32-127 range
   into escape codes.  It assumes that you have a working Unicode
   environment that will not be corrupted by intermediate tools.  For safety
   in other environments, use the  formatter instead.
  
   Frink has a powerful system for drawing graphics in a simple way.  Here are
   some of the features:
  Flexible coordinate system: You can draw your graphics to any
    coordinates you wish, and Frink will, by default, automatically scale and
    center them in your display device, eliminating the tedium and error of
    manual coordinate conversions, adjustment for different window or printer
    sizes, etc.

     Graphics can be specified with explicit
    lengths (such as "3 cm",) so exactly-sized drawings can be printed.
    (Well, as accurately as your printer's driver allows them to be!)

    Frink's graphics are primarily designed to
    work with shapes, not individual pixels, so they can be re-scaled perfectly
    to display with full resolution on printers, in resizable graphics
    windows, in image files, or in rescalable vector formats.
    
     Polygons and polylines are drawn with
    properly-joined, angled corners.

    Lines and shapes are anti-aliased, eliminating
    jagged edges.  (When running under Java 1.2 or later.  Frink's graphics
    will also run on Java 1.1, but without antialiased edges.)  Aliasing can
    now be controlled through the Antialiasing
    methods.

   Transparency (alpha channel): Allows transparent shapes and
    lines, and see-through shapes to be drawn on top of other shapes.
    Anti-aliased edges are drawn with proper transparency so they can be
    overlaid on any background color or image.  (Requires Java 1.2 or later for
    transparency.)

     Text can be written into any graphics
    object, with properly transparent anti-aliased edges.  Text may be scaled
    along with the image, or rendered at a constant size.

     All graphics can be translated, scaled,
    and rotated, making it very easy to draw objects to the coordinate system
    that is easiest to use, and translating it into larger drawings.  When
    graphics are scaled and rotated, Frink is smart enough to keep what you've
    drawn centered and scaled to fit on the screen or printed page!

    Graphics can be easily written to various
    file formats, including JPEG, PNG, HTML5 canvas, and Scalable Vector
    Graphics (SVG and SVGZ) formats.  PNG supports transparency (alpha channel)
    and allows antialiased, semi-transparent lines and shapes to be overlaid
    over other backgrounds or layers.  SVG format allows infinite rescaling and
    perfect rendering to high-resolution devices such as printers, and perfect
    import into other vector graphics programs.

   Easy display on different devices: The same graphics object
    can be created and then displayed on screen, printed to a printer, or
    written to a file, using a single command.
  
   Graphics are drawn and displayed in three steps:
  Create an object of type :
    Draw your shapes into the  object:
    
      g.line[1,100,100,1]
      g.line[1,1,100,100]
     Show (or print, or write your image to a file):
    
   That's it.  Frink takes care of the scaling and centering by default.  The
   coordinates that you choose can be whatever is most convenient and natural
   for you.  You can also create as many  objects as you
   want.  By default, when you call , each
   graphics object is displayed in its own resizable window. 
  
   Coordinates in Frink's graphics are very flexible.  There are a few things
   to note:
  Coordinates are specified as (x, y) with  being the
    horizontal coordinate and  the vertical coordinate.

   Horizontal coordinates increase as you move right.

   Vertical coordinates increase as you move down.  (Note that this is the
    common convention for almost all computer graphics, but is different than
    the usual mathematical conventions.  You can change this using a Graphics Transformation, but be warned
    that will vertically flip text as well.)

   Arbitrary-sized coordinates:  Coordinates can be as big or small
    as you want.  Any real number that Frink can represent is fine.

   Automatic centering and scaling: You don't need to worry about
    the size or location of your rendering window.  By default, all graphics
    are resized and centered to fit into your graphics device (whether it's a
    resizable window, a printed page, or a graphic file.)  This saves lots of
    time and effort when drawing most graphics.  Even if your graphics have
    been scaled, translated, and rotated, Frink will still ensure that what
    you've drawn is scaled and centered.

    Aspect ratio is preserved by default.  That is, if
    a rectangle is 2 units wide and 1 unit high, it will retain that shape on
    resizing.  (You can change that by multiplying all coordinates on one axis
    by a "dummy" dimension that isn't dimensionless and isn't a length.)

   Accurately-scaled drawings: Coordinates may have dimensions of
    length (e.g. "1 inch"), in which case they are treated specially.  In this
    case, the graphics are still translated to fit into your view window, but
    Frink will also attempt to render them at the specified size.  This is
    highly dependent on how your operating system reports its resolution.  It
    works very well for printers, but not as well for monitors (especially in
    Windows, which almost always reports its screen resolution as 96 dpi, no
    matter what it really is.)  This allows you to print exact-sized drawings
    to the accuracy allowed by your operating system and printer drivers.  See
    the notes below about dimensions.

    Including the special case for length,
    all coordinates can have any units of measure, as long as all
     coordinates along the same axis have the same dimensions.  However,
    both axes do  have to have the same dimensions as each other,
    and will be scaled to fit in the window (because preserving aspect ratio is
    meaningless if they don't have the same units.)
  
   For example, the following short program prints graph paper with a 1 mm
   grating:
  
g= new graphics
g.color[.7,.9,.7] 
for x=0 mm to 8.5 in step 1 mm
   g.line[x, 0 in, x, 11 in]
for y=0mm to 11 in step 1 mm
   g.line[0 in, y, 8.5 in, y]
   All of Frink's graphics are built out of a small number of basic shapes.
   These are drawn into a  object using the methods
   outlined below.  For example, you use them like the following:
  
    g = new graphics
    g.color[0,0,0]  
    g.fillEllipseCenter[0,0,10,10]
    g.fillEllipseCenter[0,0,9,9]
   A new  object can also be obtained by calling new
   color[] or .  Note that creating the color this way does not set the
   color in any graphics object.  That must be done separately with a
   call to .
  Sets the current
      drawing color.  All following drawings will be made using this color.
      The color is specified with its red, green, and blue
      components which are floating-point values which must range from 0.0 to
      1.0, with 0.0 being completely dark for that component, and 1.0 being
      the brightest value for that component.  In a new graphics object, the
      default drawing color is black.  This also returns the color object so
      you can later re-use it in a  method call.

    Also specifies a
      color, but with transparency.  The  component
      specifies the opacity of the color, and takes values from 0.0 to 1.0,
      with 1.0 being fully opaque and 0.0 being fully transparent.  (Note:
      transparency requires Java 1.2 or later.)  This also returns the color
      object so you can later re-use it in a 
        method call.

    Sets the current color to
      a color object that has been previously obtained from a call to
      , , or a call to the constructor new color[] or .
      
    Sets the
      background color of the graphics window or image file.  The color
      components are specified as above.  There should be only one
       method call in a 
      object, and it should be the first method called when drawing.  If more
      than one call to  is made, this will raise a
      warning.  (It will also replace any existing background color, but that
      behavior should not be relied on.)  By default, the background color is
      opaque white (or transparent when writing formats like SVG.)

    backgroundColor[]Sets the
      background color of the graphics window or image file to
      a color object that has been previously obtained from a call to
      , , or a call to the constructor new color[] or .  The
      warnings in the above  method also applies
      to this method.

    Sets the stroke width used to
      draw lines, polygon outlines, ellipses, and polylines.  If the width is a
      dimensionless number, (e.g. ) the stroke
      will be scaled along with the drawing.  If the stroke has units of
      length, (e.g. ) the lines will be
      rendered at that constant width regardless of how the image is scaled.
      (Note that the stroke width can not be changed in Java 1.1.)

    Sets the transparency (often
      called "alpha channel") of all subsequent drawing operations.  The
      opacity is a dimensionless number from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully
      opaque.)  This primarily allows you to draw transparent images, as
      transparency can already be specified when setting colors.  If a color
      already has a transparency, that transparency value will be multiplied
      by this global transparency.  (Note that the transparency can not be
      changed in Java 1.1.) 
      
    Draws a straight line
      segment between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the current color.
      
    fillRectSize[]drawRectSize[]Draws
    a rectangle (filled or outlined, depending on the method called) with top
      left coordinate (x,y) and the specified width and height.  If the width
      or height are negative, this draws the rectangle to the left or to the
      top of that point.
      
    fillRectSides[]drawRectSides[]Draws a
    rectangle (filled or outlined, depending on the method called) defined by
      its four sides.  The sides do not have to be in any particular order.

    fillRectCenter[cx, cy, width,
    height]drawRectCenter[]Draws a
    rectangle (filled or outlined, depending on the method called) defined by
    its centerpoint (cx, cy) and its width and height.
      
    fillEllipseSize[]drawEllipseSize[]Draws
      a filled or unfilled ellipse (or circle if width==height) with top left
      coordinate (x,y) and the specified width and height.  If the width or
      height are negative, this draws the ellipse to the left or to the top of
      that point.
      
    fillEllipseSides[]drawEllipseSides[]Draws
    a filled or unfilled ellipse (or circle if width==height) defined by its
    four sides.  The sides do not have to be in any particular order.

    fillEllipseCenter[]drawEllipseCenter[]Draws
    a filled or unfilled ellipse or circle defined by its centerpoint (cx, cy)
      and its width and height.
  
   Drawing a curve or a polygon out of  primitives might not
   give good results, as the lines don't know that they're supposed to be
   connected to each other.  To solve this problem, Frink has 
   ,  and 
   objects which produce high-quality, connected lines with properly-joined
   corners.  Drawing a polygon or polyline to a graphics object consists of a
   few steps:
  Create the graphics object (if you haven't done so already.)
    Create a polygon, filled polygon,  polyline.  (The sample
    below shows all three.  Pick one.)
    
     Alternately, you can pass in a list of points to any of the above
     constructors, in which case you can skip the next "adding points" step.
    
      a = [ [1,3], [7,4], [6,2] ]
      p = new polygon[a]
     
     Alternately, you can copy a polygon type to another polygon using the copy
     constructors:
    
      a = [ [1,3], [7,4], [6,2] ]
      p = new polygon[a]
      fp = new filledPolygon[p]Add an arbitrary number of points to the line or polygon using its
     method.  Each point represents a vertex in the
    polyline or polygon.
    
      p.addPoint[]
      p.addPoint[]
      p.addPoint[]
     
     Note that a  or  is
     .  You should  manually connect
     the last point back to the first by repeating it at the end of the list.
     You should only have as many  calls as there are
     vertices in your polygon.
    Add the polygon to the graphics object.  A polygon can be added to
    multiple graphics objects.  The drawing color and stroke width used in
    rendering the polygon are the ones which are active at the time of the
     call.  Note that no points should be added to the
     polygon after it is added to the graphics object!Show the graphics object (or print, or save it to a file, or keep
    drawing into it and show it later...)
    
   You can call the following methods on a ,
   , or .
  Adds a point to the polygon.
      
    Returns the area of the polygon, with
      appropriate dimensions.

    Returns the centroid of the polygon
      as an array [, ].
      
    Returns the points in the polygon as an
      array of [x, y] points.

    Returns  if
      the point  is inside the polygon, 
      otherwise.
      
    Displays the polygon using the default
      display method.
  
   A  allows you to create complex shapes consisting
   of straight lines, quadratic and cubic Bézier curves, arcs, and
   ellipses.  These paths can be filled or outlines, and can have multiple
   sub-paths that represent the "inside" and "outside" of an object.  For
   example, rendering a filled letter  in which one can see
   through the "hole" in the P can be obtained with a GeneralPath, and is not
   possible with a .
   The GeneralPath functionality is only available under
   Java 1.2 and later.  Attempting to draw with a GeneralPath in earlier
   releases will produce a warning and the GeneralPath will not be drawn.
  
   Using a  object consists of a few steps:
  Create the graphics object (if you haven't done so already.)
    Create a GeneralPath or a filledGeneralPath.  (The sample below shows
    both.  Pick one.)
    p = new filledGeneralPathAdd an arbitrary number of segments using the following methods on the
     class:
    Add the GeneralPath to the graphics object.  A GeneralPath can be added
    to multiple graphics objects.  The drawing color and stroke width used in
    rendering the GeneralPath are the ones which are active at the time of the
     call.  Note that no points should be added to
     the GeneralPath after it is added to the graphics object!Show the graphics object (or print, or save it to a file, or keep
    drawing into it and show it later...)
    
   For a sample of using the GeneralPath class, see GeneralPathTest.frink
   which demonstrates drawing a filled letter "P" with a properly-transparent
   hole.
  
   High-quality text with transparent anti-aliased edges can be added
   to any  object using the following methods:
  font[]font[fontName,
        style, height]Sets the current font that will be used to
      render text.  The arguments are:
      :  A string indicating the name of the
        font family.  For portability to all platforms and image types
        (including SVG files,) this should be one of "Serif", "SansSerif", "Monospaced".  However,
        any font name available on your system may be used if you don't care
        about portability.
        
       :  An string containing information about
        the font style.  This should contain one of "plain", "bold", "italic", "bold+italic".  (It's
        actually a case-insensitive substring search that just looks for
        "bold" and "italic" so this can be written in a lot of ways.) 
        
       : The height of the font in the current
        coordinate system.  Height is taken as the distance from standard
        baseline to the next standard baseline, not necessarily as the height
        of the tallest characters.  This fits the usual definition of font size
        used in most systems.

        
         If the height is a dimensionless number, (e.g. ) the font will be scaled
         along with the drawing.  If the height has units of length,
         (e.g.  or ) the font will be rendered at that constant height,
         regardless of how the image is scaled.  Note that using a height with
         dimensions of length might force the text out of the viewable area if
         the drawing is scaled too small to accommodate it.
        
       If you don't specify a font before drawing text, your system will use
       its default font, which may give different results when the same
       program is run on different systems or rendered to different devices.
       This behavior may change to specify a fixed default font in the future.
      Draws the specified text
       (vertically and horizontally) at the coordinates
      (x,y).  Since it's hard to predict how wide (or tall) text will be until
      it's rendered, centering is often the most useful option.

    Draws text as above,
      but also rotated by the specified angle (counterclockwise.)  The angle
      must have angular units, ( or )
      
    text[text, x, y, horizontalAlign,
       verticalAlign]Draws the specified text with one point specified
      by the (x,y) coordinates and the rest of the text aligned relative to
      that as specified by the  and
       parameters.
      
      
       The parameter  is a string
       containing one of: "left", "right", "center"
       indicating if the  coordinate indicates the left, right,
       or center horizontal position of the text.  For example, if the
       horizontal alignment is given as , the specified
        coordinate will be the right side of the text.
      The parameter  is a string
       containing one of: "top", "bottom", "center",
        "baseline" indicating if the  coordinate indicates
       the top, bottom, center, or baseline vertical position of the text.  For
       example, if the vertical alignment is given as , the
       specified  coordinate will be the top of the text.  The
        parameter indicates the bottom of most
       characters, but characters with descenders like "j", "p" and "q" may
       hang below the baseline.
      text[text, x, y, horizontalAlign,
       verticalAlign, angle]Draws text as above,
      but also rotated by the specified angle (counterclockwise.)  The angle
      must have angular units, ( or )
      
    caption[text, align="bottom", angle=0 degrees]
       Adds a quick caption text to the specified side of a
        graphic.   is optional but defaults
        to .  If specified,  must be
        one of the following
        strings: , , ,
        or  indicating the side of the graphic where the
        text will be placed.  The text may be rotated by the specified
        optional  (counterclockwise.)  The angle must have
        angular units, ( or ) It is suggested to set a font before drawing the
        caption, but either the last font or a font that is 1/20 of the
        graphic's height will be used if no font was specified.
    The following program draws a 5x5 grid of random
   characters.
  
g=new graphics
g.font["SansSerif", "bold", 10]   
   for y=1 to 5
      g.text[char[random[char["A"], char["Z"]]], x*10, y*10]
   A  object can be built up from multiple
    objects that are added to it.  These graphics can be
   added at their original size, or placed at a certain location and size.
   This makes it easy to create complex graphics from many different graphics
   objects that were rendered at their "natural" sizes and then automatically
   resized to fit where you want them, no matter what coordinates they
    were originally drawn to!
   When adding one  obect into another, the new graphics
   object added will be transformed according to the current state of the Graphics Transformation and global
   transparency (set by the  method listed
   above in the Shapes and Colors section.)
  
   Note that the object is fit according to its estimated bounding box;
   if the bounding box is estimated too large, then the graphic may not
   fill the entire region requested, and you may have to manually adjust
   the scaling.
   
   The following methods on a  object allow you to add
   other  objects to them.
  Adds another graphic
      expression of any type to this graphics object.  By default, the other
      graphic is added at its original coordinates and size unless a coordinate transformation has been set
      first.
      
       See the other  methods below to see how to add a
       graphic at a specified location and size.

    addCenter[, , ,
      , , ]Adds
      another graphic expression to this graphics object, attempting to place
      its center at the coordinates  and making it fit
      within the specified  and .  This
      allows you to easily compose a  object out of other
       objects, no matter what coordinates they were
      drawn to. 

      
       The aspect ratio of the graphic is maintained unless the optional
       argument  is set to 
       (default is ).
      addCenterRotate[, , ,
      , , ,
      ]Identical to 
      above, but the graphic is rotated around () by the
      specified angle (e.g.  or ).  Positive angles are clockwise.
      
    addSides[, , ,
      , , ]Adds
      another graphic expression to this graphics object, shrinking it or
      stretching it to fit into a rectangle with the specified sides.  The
      sides do not have to be in any particular order.

      
       The aspect ratio of the graphic is maintained unless the optional
       argument  is set to 
       (default is ).
      addSidesRotate[, , ,
      , , , ]
      Identical to  above, but the graphic is rotated
      around the center of its bounding box by the specified angle
      (e.g.  or ).  Positive
      angles are clockwise.

    addSize[, , ,
      , , ]Adds
      another graphic expression to this graphics object, shrinking it or
      stretching it to fit into a rectangle with top left coordinate (left,
      top) and the specified width and height. If the width or height are
      negative, this draws the graphic to the left or to the top of that
      point, allowing you to align a graphic to the left, right, top, or
      bottom of a point or line.

      
       The aspect ratio of the graphic is maintained unless the optional
       argument  is set to 
       (default is ).
      addSizeRotate[, , ,
      , , ,
      ]
     Identical to  above, but the graphic is rotated
      around the center of its bounding box by the specified angle
      (e.g.  or ).  Positive
      angles are clockwise.
  
   Frink allows you to rotate, translate, and scale graphics objects, allowing
   you to write simple code using the coordinate system that is most logical,
   and translate or scale it wherever you want.  Like all of Frink's other
   graphics, Frink ensures that whatever you draw is automatically scaled and
   centered into the display, and can be exported to various file formats.
  
   The current graphics transformation can be saved with a call to
    and should be restored with a
   corresponding call to .restoreTransform[].
  
   The following methods are available on a  object to
   transform the coordinates.  Each transform is appended to the previous
   transforms.  After making a transformation, all subsequent drawing or
    commands will use the current transform.
  Moves all
      subsequent drawing commands by the specified distance on the horizontal
      and vertical axes. (Positive  moves to the right,
      positive  moves down.)

       This corresponds to the matrix multiplication:
       
        which gives the equations:
       Scales all subsequent
      drawing commands around the point (0,0) by the specified scale on the x
      and y axes. A coefficient of 1 corresponds to no scaling on that axis.
      A negative coefficient indicates a flip on that axis.  (Note that this
      will also flip text!)

      
       Note that this function is not usually what you need; you usually want
       to scale around another point.  See the four-argument version of this
       function below.
       This corresponds to the matrix multiplication:
       
        which gives the equations:
       Scales all subsequent drawing commands around the point
       by the specified scales  on the x
      and y axes.  A coefficient of 1 corresponds to no scaling on that axis.
      A negative coefficient indicates a flip on that axis.  (Note that this
      will also flip text!)

      
       This is equivalent to the less-efficient:
      
        translate[cx, cy]
        scale[sx, sy] This corresponds to the matrix multiplication:
       
        which gives the equations:
       
         x' = sx x + cx (1 - sx)
         y' = sy y + cy (1 - sy)
        
         x' = sx (x-cx) + cx
         y' = sy (y-cy) + cy
        Rotates all subsequent drawing
      commands around the point (0,0) by the specified angle.  Positive angles
      are clockwise.

      
       Note that this function is rarely what you need; you usually want to
       rotate around another point.  See the three-argument version of this
       function below.
       This corresponds to the matrix multiplication:
       
        which gives the equations:
       
         x' = x cos[angle] - y sin[angle]
         y' = x sin[angle] + y cos[angle]
        Rotates
      all subsequent drawing commands around the point ()
      by the specified angle. Positive angles are clockwise.

      
       This is equivalent to the less-efficient:
      
        translate[cx, cy]
        rotate[angle] This corresponds to the matrix multiplication:
       cx (1-cos[angle]) + cy sin[angle] cy (1-cos[angle]) - cx sin[angle]
        which gives the equations:
       
         x' = x cos[angle] - y sin[angle] + cx (1-cos[angle]) + cy sin[angle]
         y' = x sin[angle] + y cos[angle] + cy (1-cos[angle]) - cx sin[angle]
        
         x' = (x - cx) cos[angle] - (y - cy) sin[angle] + cx
         y' = (x - cx) sin[angle] + (y - cy) cos[angle] + cy
        Performs an
      arbitrary affine transform on subsequent drawing commands, by specifying
      all relevant coefficients of an affine transformation matrix.

       This corresponds to the matrix multiplication:

       
       which gives the equations:
      
        x' = a x + c y + e
        y' = b x + d y + f
       
       See the technical notes for the above functions to see how various
       transformations are achieved by specifying the coefficients of this
       matrix.  Note also that this function can be used to create skews as
       well as rotations, translations, and scales.
       If you want to reverse this transformation, or
        any of the above transformations, the inverse equations are:
       
          x =  (c (f - y') - d (e - x')) / (a d - b c)
          y =           -(a (f - y') - b (e - x')) / (a d - b c)
        Saves the current state of the
      graphics transform so it can later be restored with a call to
      Restores the state of the
      graphics transform to the point where the last
       was called.
  
   To constrain the area in which graphics can be drawn, you can specify a
   clipping region on a  object.   you set
   a clipping region, subsequent drawing commands will only be drawn within
   that region.
  
   A cool thing about the clipping implementation is that, like all of Frink's
   graphics, you can draw to any coordinate system that makes sense to you,
   even if it's rotated, scaled, skewed, and clipped, and Frink will
   automatically center and scale that into your graphics window by default,
   greatly simplifying many graphics programming tasks.  In other words,
   clipping can be used to "zoom in" on a section of a larger graphic--just
   set a clipping region before drawing the graphic and only the section
   within the clipping region will be displayed.
  
   Each time you add a clipping boundary, it  the existing
   clipping boundary, and the clipping boundary will become the intersection
   of the previous clipping boundary and the new clipping boundary.
  
   Clipping boundaries can be saved and restored with the
    and
    methods.  Currently, these
   must be properly nested with
    and
   .restoreTransform[] calls.
  
   The following methods are on a  object.
  clipRectSize[left, top, width, height]Adds a new
      clipping rectangle with top left coordinate x,y and the specified width
      and height.   If the width or height are negative, the clipping
      rectangle is drawn to the left or to the top of that point.

    clipRectSides[x1, y1, x2, y2]Adds a new clipping
      rectangle with the specified sides.

    clipRectCenter[cx, cy, width, height]Adds a new
      clipping rectangle with the specified centerpoint, width, and height.

    clipEllipseSize[left, top, width, height]Adds a new
      clipping ellipse with top left coordinate x,y and the specified width
      and height.   If the width or height are negative, the clipping
      elipse is drawn to the left or to the top of that point.

    clipEllipseSides[x1, y1, x2, y2]Adds a new clipping
      ellipse with the specified sides.

    clipEllipseCenter[cx, cy, width, height]Adds a new
      clipping ellipse with the specified centerpoint, width, and height.

    Adds the specified shape to the
      current clipping boundary.  The shape may be either a rectangle, ellipse,
      , or . (The new clipping
      boundary is the  of the old boundary and the new
      boundary, always making the clipping boundary smaller.)

    Saves the current clipping region so
      it can later be restored with a call to .

    Restores the current clipping region
      to the state it had at the last call to .
      Currently, these calls must be properly nested with
       and
      .restoreTransform[] calls.
  
   By default, Frink's graphics are automatically scaled and centered in the
   display.  All of the graphics that you draw will automatically be visible,
   no matter what coordinate system you use.  However, sometimes you may want
   to have fine-grained control over the region that is displayed, even if you
   don't fill it entirely, or if you want to draw outside the region, or if
   you want to "zoom in" on just part of a graphic.
  
   If you want to constrain the viewport of a graphics object, you can do so
   by drawing a transparent rectangle (or other shape) to set the minimum
   size, and by clipping to a rectangle (or other shape) to set the maximum
   size.  This is intentionally somewhat vague because Frink's graphics
   operations allow for a wide variety of viewport settings with many shapes.
  
   For example, to set the viewport to a rectangle, do something like the
   following with your  object  drawing to
   it:
  
    g = new graphics[]
    g.color[0,0,0,0] 
    g.fillRectSides[, , , ] 
    g.clipRectSides[, , , ] 
    g.color[0,0,0]  
   You can also clip to other shapes, such as circles, ellipses,
   polygons, , etc.  You can also use other
   convenience methods such
   as , , , ,
   etc., if they are more convenient.
  
   By default, graphics and text are antialiased on most platforms.  That is,
   edges of lines and text are smoothed and slightly blurred to reduce jagged
   edges.  This may be unwelcome in some situations, such as when drawing many
   adjacent rectangles.  Antialiasing of graphics and text can be controlled
   by the following methods on a  object.

  If set to ,
      all subsequent shape drawing operations to that 
      object will no longer be anti-aliased.  (Note that this does not affect
      anti-aliasing of text, which is controlled separately by the
       function below.)  This may be turned on and
      off over the course of drawing a single  object.
      Not all graphics environments support control of anti-aliasing, as noted
      below:

      : The SVG specification does not directly allow control
        of antialiasing, but Frink sets the shape-rendering="crispEdges"
        rendering property (link opens in new window), which seems to turn off
        antialiasing in many rendering environments.
        
       :  The HTML5 canvas specification does not seem to
        allow any control of antialiasing, so this does nothing.
      If set to
      , all
      subsequent text drawn to that  object will
      no longer be anti-aliased.  This may be turned on and off over the
      course of drawing a single  object.  Not all
      environments support control of anti-aliased text, as noted below:

      : The SVG specification does not directly allow control
        of antialiasing, but this sets the text-rendering="optimizeSpeed"
        rendering property (link opens in new window), which seems to turn off
        text antialiasing in many rendering environments.
        
       :  The HTML5 canvas specification does not seem to
        allow control of antialiasing, so this does nothing.
      
   Once a  object has been constructed, it can be shown
   on-screen, printed, or written to a file using the following methods:
  Displays the graphic object using the
      default method.  On most platforms, this opens a new resizable window.
      Note that this method returns an object that can be used to repaint the
      graphics.  See the Animation section of the
      documentation for more.

    Displays the graphic object using the
      default method, specifying the insets as a value between 0 and 1 where 1
      means to use 100% of the window with the graphic (no borders.)  An insets
      value of 0.95 causes 95% of the window's width and/or height to be
      used by the graphic, and 5% as borders.  On most platforms, this opens a
      new resizable window.  Note that this method returns an object that can
      be used to repaint the graphics.  See the Animation section of the documentation for more.
      
    Displays the graphic
    object using the default method, specifying the width and height of the
     window as integers.  Note that this method returns an object that can be
    used to repaint the graphics.  See the Animation
    section of the documentation for more.

    show[]Displays the
      graphic object using the default method, specifying the width and height
      of the window as integers, and the insets as a floating-point value
      between 0 and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic
      (no borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 95% of the window's width
      and/or height to be used by the graphic, and 5% of the window's width
      and/or height to be borders.
      
    Prints the graphics object to a single page
      on a printer.  This will produce a print dialog that allows you to
      select the printer, and the orientation and margins for the page.
      
    Prints the graphics object to
      a single page on a printer.  This will produce a print dialog that
      allows you to select the printer, and the orientation and margins for
      the page.   is a floating-point value
      between 0 and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic
      (no borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 95% of the window's width
      and/or height to be graphics, and 5% as borders.  These insets are
       
      to any margins you set in the print dialog.  (Specifying insets is
      usually only necessary when rendering a background color that you want
      to have extend a certain distance around the graphic.)
      
    printTiled[]Prints the
      graphics object tiled across multiple pages on a printer.  This allows
      very large graphics to be printed.  The arguments indicate how many
      printer pages wide and high the graphic should be drawn.
      
    printTiled[pagesWide, pagesHigh,
       insets]Prints the graphics object tiled across multiple pages
      on a printer.  This allows very large graphics to be printed.  The
      arguments indicate how many printer pages wide and high the graphic
      should be drawn.  is a floating-point value between 0
      and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic (no
      borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 5% of the window's width
      and/or height to be borders. These insets are  to
      any margins you set in the print dialog.  (Specifying insets is usually
      only necessary when rendering a background color that you want to have
      extend a certain distance around the graphic.)

    Takes a  and
      returns a new  object in which the black colors are
      turned to white and the whites are turned to black, with all the colors
      near to gray inverted the same way.  This does not affect other colors;
      red remains red.  This is useful for making graphics that look like
      Wargames on-screen (black background with white lines) but don't destroy
      your printer ink budget.  A typical usage would be:

      
        g.invertGrays[].show[]  
        g.print[]  toBase64[]Encodes the
      graphic as a string which represents a base-64 encoded bitmap in the
      specified format ( formats include "jpg", "png") at the
      specified width and height.  This may be included in an HTML document as
      a  URI, included in an email, etc.
      
    write[]
      writeTransparent[]
      write[filename, width, height, insets]
      writeTransparent[filename, width, height, insets]
     Writes the image to a file with the specified width and height
      (usually in pixels).  The format of the file is guessed from the
      filename's extension.  If the  method is
      called, and if the image format supports it, the image will be rendered
      with a transparent background, allowing you to stack and create
      composite images with full anti-aliasing and background support.

      If exactly one of  or  are
       specified as , and the other is an integer, the size
       of the undefined axis will be calculated from the defined width or
       height and the aspect ratio of the
        that is being drawn.
      
       In the versions of these functions where  is
       specified, the value of that argument indicates how wide a border
       should be left when drawing.  When specifying  (indicating
       100%) to the  argument, the drawn image occupies
       100% of the width and height, with no border.  By default, only 95%
       (0.95) of the width or height is used, leaving a small 5% border around
       the drawn graphics.  Specifying the insets is important when rendering
       image files out at their original size.  See the Images section of the documentation for more.
       
      The file formats supported by
      your version of Java may vary, but the following should be supported:
      
      : Does not support transparency.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
       : (Portable Network Graphics) Supports transparency and
        full anti-aliasing of transparent graphics.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
       : (Scalable Vector Graphics) A vector format that is
        infinitely resizable.  Supports transparency.  By default, all
        backgrounds in SVG graphics are transparent.  Works in all versions
        of Java.    Due to a deficiency in the SVG standard,
        drawings with dimensions of length (e.g. "1 inch") may not work
        properly for some shapes, notably polygons, polylines, and GeneralPath.
       : (Scalable Vector Graphics, compressed with GZIP)  This
        is the same as the SVG format, but is compressed with the GZIP
        compression algorithm.  Since SVG files usually contain a lot of
        repetition, using this format will significantly reduce file size and
        should be parseable by most/all programs that can handle SVG files.
       : (HTML5 canvas support required)
        While HTML5 will not be a finalized specification until at least 2014,
        major modern browsers for desktop and mobile devices (Firefox, Chrome,
        Opera, Safari, IE) support the HTML5 features that Frink requires.
        Transmission of vector graphics in vector formats, allowing
          efficient, antialiased rendering of vector graphics.

         Bitmapped images are transmitted within the HTML document as
          embedded  URIs encoded in base-64, allowing you to
          send the entire graphic as a single HTML file.  Bitmapped images are
          transmitted at the end of the file, and displayed as they are loaded,
          allowing progressive display of documents containing multiple
          bitmaps.

         All of Frink's graphics primitives are supported, including
          bitmaps, , partially-transparent graphics,
          rotations, translations, and scaling.

         HTML5 is rendered to relatively simple, user-modifiable code.

         What doesn't work in HTML5 (future wish list):Drawings with dimensions ( a rectangle with width
            ) does not get rendered properly to HTML5.  I'm
            still doing research to see if we can get a reasonable resolution
            figure from the rendering environment.
            
           HTML5, for some ungodly reason, for a long time did not not
            support the even-odd
             winding rule for filling graphics, which becomes important
            when drawing an arbitrary  and
            self-intersecting or concentric filled polygons.  HTML5 only
            supported the rather stupid and useless nonzero winding rule which will make some 
            objects with "hollow" centers not render the same in HTML5 as they
            do in all other sane environments (e.g. Swing, AWT, Android, SVG,
            PostScript, PDF).
            
            
             However, this problem is being gradually addressed in current
             browsers, (but not yet in the official HTML5 Canvas spec!) but your browser
             needs to support the HTML 
             Canvas's  method for Frink's
             graphics to work properly now.  This appears to be supported in
             current versions of Firefox (21+), Firefox on Android, Chrome
             (27+), Opera (15+), Safari 8.0, and IE11 (according to this).

           Animation is not yet possible in HTML5.  It's not clear if this
            will be easy without porting all of Frink to JavaScript.

           All bitmapped graphics are embedded in PNG format.  These may
           be larger than the corresponding JPEG graphics, but they are
           lossless and allow alpha channels, which JPEG does not allow.  It's
           possible that there may be a switch in the future to embed bitmaps
           in JPEG format and to control the quality, or the renderer may get
           "smarter" and determine if alpha channels are present, and switch
           rendering formats for efficiency.

           When rendering just a portion of a bitmapped image to HTML5,
           the entire original bitmap file is transmitted in the HTML5
           document.

           If the browser doesn't support the HTML5 
           element, Frink could theoretically render a small thumbnail image
           (or full-resolution image, but that would be wasteful) showing the
           user what they're missing.  If the browser doesn't support
           , the user is warned about possibly needing to
            open the document in a newer browser.

           There appears to be no way to control antialiasing in the HTML5 spec
          writeFormat[filename, format, width, height]writeFormatTransparent[filename, format, width, height]
     Writes
      to a file, explicitly specifying the format.  The format should be a
      string containing one of "svg", "SVG", "svgz", "SVGZ", "jpeg",
       "JPEG", "jpg", "JPG", "png", "PNG", "html", "HTML", or possibly
      another format that your platform understands (like "" /
      "" on Android.)
      
    Renders the graphic as full-color ANSI terminal Unicode characters.
      The terminal must support true-color ANSI and Unicode block characters.
      This allows you to preview a graphic even over an SSH connection with no
      graphics capability.
  
   The following draws a partially-transparent circle, and then successively
   displays it on-screen, prints it, and renders it to various image files:
  
    g = new graphics
    g.color[0, 0, 1, 0.5]   
    g.fillEllipseCenter[0,0,10,10]
    g.print[]
    g.write["circle.jpg", 200, 200]
    g.write["circle.png", 200, 200]
    g.writeTransparent["circleTrans.png", 200, 200]
    g.write["circle.svg", 200, 200]
    g.write["circle.html", 200, 200]
   getBoundingBox[]Returns
      the coordinates of the bounding box for the graphics object in the form
      [left, top, right, bottom].  If the bounding box is empty
      (that is, there are no drawable elements in
      , this returns .
  
   Bitmap images can be loaded and drawn to a graphics object, displayed in
   their own window, resized, printed (including tiled across several pages,)
   drawn over, saved out to files, etc.  You can also load an image or create
   it in memory, and read or write the values of individual pixels, allowing
   image processing or analysis.
  Note that Java 1.1 and earlier did not have a portable, public way to
     read and write individial pixels of images, so many of these methods
     require Java 1.2 or later.
   To load an image, call , passing it a
   URL.  The URL can be of any type your Java platform understands, including a
    URL indicating a file on your local system:
  
    img1 = new image["http://futureboy.us/images/futureboydomethumb4.gif"]
    img2 = new image["file:yourfile.gif"]
   
   An image can also be loaded from a Java object that contains an
   already-opened : new
   image[].  This allows you to create images
   from open files, URLs, network sources, servlet containers, in-memory
   sources, etc., without writing their data to temporary files.
  
    To create a new (blank) image, specify the width and height in pixels:
  
    img3 = new image[640, 480]
   
   To copy an image, use the copy constructor:
  
   This will make a copy of all of the pixels in the image, so the copy can be
   modified without modifying the original.
  
   You can turn a  object into a bitmapped image in
   memory by using the method:
  .toImage[, ]
   
    new image[, , ]
   
   In both of the above functions, both 
   and  are dimensionless integers, or, if exactly one
   of  or  are specified
   as , and the other is an integer, the size of the
   undefined axis will be calculated from the defined width or height and the
   aspect ratio of the  that is being drawn.
  
   This gives you a readable/writable bitmap which allows you to read and
   write the individual pixels of the graphic.  For example, to create a
   graphic and then render it to a bitmapped image in memory, you may do
   something like:
  
    g = new graphics
    g.line[0,0,1,1]
    img4 = new image[g, 300, 300]
   
   Note that there are already methods to write graphics to a bitmapped file
   format.  Using this constructor is only necessary if you want to read or
   write specific pixels of the rendered graphic .
  
   The image can be then shown in its own window by calling the
    method:
  
   The following table summarizes the methods available on an
    object:
  Returns the height of the image in
        pixels.
        
    Returns the width of the image in
        pixels.
        
    Returns the dimensions of the image in
      pixels as a two-dimensional array .  You can thus call it like:[width,height]=.getSize[]Returns the pixel's color as an array
      of [red, green, blue, alpha] components between, each between 0 and 1
      inclusive.
        
    Returns the pixel's color as an
      array of [red, green, blue, alpha] components between, each between 0 and
      255 inclusive.
      
    Returns the pixel's color as
      a  object that can be passed to other methods that
      take color objects.
      
    Returns the pixel's grayscale
      value as an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive.  This is meant for
      quick processing and does not correctly perform any perceptual encoding.
      
    setPixel[x, y, red, green, blue, alpha]Sets the
      specified pixel's color to the color specified by the red, green, blue,
        alpha components, each between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
        
    setPixel[x, y, red, green, blue]Sets the
      specified pixel's color to the color specified by the red, green, blue,
      components, each between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  The pixel will be fully
        opaque.
        
    setPixelInt[x, y, red, green, blue, alpha]Sets the
      specified pixel's color to the color specified by the red, green, blue,
        alpha components, each between 0 and 255 (inclusive).
        
    setPixelInt[x, y, red, green, blue]Sets the
      specified pixel's color to the color specified by the red, green, blue,
      components, each between 0 and 255 (inclusive).  The pixel will be fully
        opaque.
        
    Sets the
      specified pixel's color to a color designated by the 
      object.
        
    averagePixels[left, top, right, bottom]Returns the
      average color of the pixels within the region specified by the given
      coordinates.  Each coordinate may be a floating-point value, and if an
      incomplete pixel is sampled, it is weighted accordingly.
      The return value is an array of [red, green, blue, alpha]
      components, each between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The values for the
      coordinates can range from 0 to ( or
      ,) inclusive, indicating, for example, the
      left and right side of the pixel (or subpixel) to be sampled.  For
      example, in a 2x2 pixel image, you'd want to sample [0,0,2,2] to average
      the whole image.
        
    Forces a loaded image to have an ARGB
      color model, that is, to have an 24-bit true color model with an 8-bit
      alpha channel that supports transparency.  By default, when loading an
      image, the color model is preserved and may not support true color nor
      transparency.
        
    Forces a loaded image to have a one-bit
      monochrome color model, if your platform supports it.  This may perform
      dithering on the image.

      : Currently, the Android Bitmap.Config
      class does not support monochrome images, so this does nothing on
      Android.
       
     - Write the image to the
      specified filename.  The format of the file is guessed from the
      filename's extension. The file formats supported by your version of Java
      may vary, but the following should be supported:
      
      : Does not support transparency.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
       : (Portable Network Graphics) Supports transparency and
        full anti-aliasing of transparent graphics.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
      Returns a base-64 encoded
      string which represents the bitmap in the specified image format
      ( "jpg", "png").  This may be included in an HTML document as
      a  URI, included in an email, etc.
            
    Flips the image horizontally and returns
      a new image.
      
    Flips the image vertically and returns
      a new image.

    Turns the bits of the image into
      a array of (probably 4)  objects (the class
      may change to be real values only) which correspond to the red, green,
      blue, and alpha channels.  This array can be turned back into
      an  using the constructor .

    Turns the bits of the image into a
      single grayscale 2-dimensional array of complex values, as
      a  object which can be
      transformed quickly with the Fourier
      transform functions.  The behavior of this method will probably
      change.
      
    toComplexArrayFromLog[]Assumes that
      this image contains magnitude and phase information (green encodes
      magnitude, red encodes phase) of a
      logarithmically-encoded Fourier
      transform of an image, and reconstructs a 2-dimensional
       with the values from the image.  In other
      words, this is the inverse
      of ComplexArray2D.toLogImage[].  The
      behavior of this method will probably change.  See the sample
      program FourierImage.frink
      for a sample of FFT transforming an image, writing it as a log-encoded
      image, reading it back, and inverse-transforming back to the original
      image.

      The boolean center/decenter parameter (default is false) will center
      the DC (zero-frequency) term in the the center of the image to mimic the
      convention used by many digital image processing texts.  In other words,
      if  is true, the DC term will be located at the x
      coordinate (width + 1) div 2 (for an image that is an even number of
      pixels wide, this is just width/2) and at the y coordinate (height + 1)
      div 2 (for an image that is an even number of pixels high, this is just
      height/2).  If  is false, the DC component will be at
      (0, 0) The same flag should be passed to
       and
      ComplexArray2D.toLogImage.
      
    Displays the image (by default, in its own
      window.)

    Displays the image (by default,
      in its own window) with the specified title.

    Prints the image to a printer.

    Prints the image to a
      printer.   is a floating-point value
      between 0 and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic
      (no borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 5% of the window's width
      and/or height to be borders.  These insets are 
      to any margins you set in the print dialog.

    printTiled[]Prints the
      image to a printer, tiled across several pages to make a very large
      image.

    printTiled[pagesWide, pagesHigh,
       insets]Prints the image to a printer, tiled across several
      pages to make a very large image.  is a floating-point value
      between 0 and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic
      (no borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 5% of the window's width
      and/or height to be borders.  These insets are 
      to any margins you set in the print dialog.

    Resizes an image to
      the new specified width and height and returns a new image.  It does not
      modify the original image.  If either  or
       are the special value  or
      , then one dimension is constrained and the other
      dimension is calculated to preserve the aspect ratio of the original
      image.

      
       This is generally  what you want to do when drawing an
       image into a  object.  You usually only want to
       do this if you're going to write the image to a file at a different
       size, or work with individual rescaled pixels.  To draw an
        into a  object at any given
       size, use one of the methods in the Drawing images into graphics
       section below.  This will preserve maximum resolution across devices.
    Automatically crops the sides of an
      image where the pixels are approximately equal.  This returns a new
      image.  If all of the pixels are identical, this returns a 1x1 image.

    Performs a Gaussian blur with
      the specified (1 sigma) width and returns a new image.

    Performs a circular blur with
      the specified radius and returns a new image.

    unsharpMask[width, amount]Performs an unsharp mask
      (sharpening the image) with the specified (1 sigma) width and amount
      (which is usually 1 for 100% sharpening but can be lower or higher) and
      returns a new image. 

    Applies an edge detect filter to an
      image and returns a new image.

    Applies an arbitrary
      filter / kernel to an image and returns a new
      image.   should be a 2-dimensional array of
      numbers with odd edge sizes.  For example, a sharpening filter is
      obtained by the array

      
        [[ 0, -1,  0],
         [-1,  5, -1],
       Note:  If the elements of the matrix sum to (approximately) 1, then the
       average brightness of each pixel in the result should be about the same
       as in the original image, and pixel values outside the range [0,255]
       will be clamped to that range.  However, if the elements of the matrix
       do  sum to 1, the color channels will be normalized so that
       they fall within the range [0,255] so the result is displayable.
       The relative brightness of each color channel is now preserved.
      applyKernel[, ]Same
      as  above, but allows the user to decide if the
      brightness levels of the image are going to be normalized by setting the
      boolean value .  If  is
      false, values outside the range 0 to 255 will just be clamped to fit in
      that range.  This may result in a blank image!  However, some
      implementations of, say, edge detect filters do not normalize their
      output and this allows results to look more like other implementations.
      If  is true, the ranges will be normalized to fit
      into the range 0 to 255, possibly decreasing contrast.
      
    Normalizes the brightness levels of an
      image so that color brightnesses range from 0 to 255.

    Renders the graphic as full-color ANSI terminal Unicode characters.
      The terminal must support true-color ANSI and Unicode block characters.
      This allows you to preview a graphic even over an SSH connection with no
      graphics capability.
  
   Images can be drawn onto a  object with the following
   methods on the  object:
  draw[image, left, top, width, height]Draws
      the specified image onto the  object with the
      specified top left coordinates and the specified width and height.  Note
      that this method does  specifically preserve the image's
      aspect ratio and thus may distort the image if the width and the height
      are not in the same ratio as in the original image.  To preserve the
      aspect ratio automatically, use one of the methods below.
      
    draw[image, left, top, width, height, leftSrc,
       topSrc, rightSrc, bottomSrc]Like  above, but
      draws  of the specified image.  The parameters ending in
       contain the pixel values of the image to include.
      To preserve the aspect ratio automatically, use one of the methods below.
      
    fitCenter[image, cx, cy, width, height]Draws
      an image onto the  object with the specified center
      coordinates (cx,cy), making it fill the specified width and height as
       much as possible without modifying the aspect ratio. This will thus
      preserve the proportions of the image.

    fitCenter[image, cx, cy, width, height, leftSrc,
       topSrc, rightSrc, bottomSrc]Like  above,
      but draws  of an image. The parameters ending in
       contain the pixel values of the image to include.

    fillCenter[image, cx, cy, width,
       height]Draws an image onto the  object with
      the specified center coordinates (cx,cy), making it completely fill
       the specified width and height without modifying the aspect ratio.
      Note that this may cut off part of the image!fillCenter[image, cx, c,y width, height, leftSrc,
       topSrc, rightSrc, bottomSrc]Like  above,
      but draws  of an image. The parameters ending in
       contain the pixel values of the image to include.
      Note that this may cut off part of the image!
   See the rewriteImage.frink
   sample program for an example of loading an image, writing a
   semi-transparent watermark over it, and then saving the image out to
   another file at its original size.
  
   Animation is performed by calling
   the  method on a graphics window
   (obtained by ) which replaces the
   graphics object with a new graphics object and repaints the window.
  A short sample of animation is available in
   the animate.frink
     sample program.
     
  
   An on-screen graphics window can be repainted as items are added to
   its  object.  Repainting is not done automatically,
   but is under the programmer's control.  This allows the screen to be
   repainted only when desired.
  
   The  method returns an object with a
    or  method
   that instructs the graphics window to be painted.   don't save
   this object if you're not planning on doing incremental animation, or set
   the variable to some value such as  when animation is
   complete.  This will allow the window's resources to be garbage-collected
   as soon as possible.
  
    g = new graphics
    window = g.show[]
    {
       g.fillRectCenter[x,0,1,1]
    }
   
   Frink can combine a series of  objects into a single
   animated GIF image very simply.  The series of steps is:
  Create an object of type , optionally setting the
    frame rate.  The frame rate can be specified as either a time or a
    frequency, for example,  or  or
    .

    Create a  object for each frame and draw into it
    using the methods described above.

    g = new graphics
      ......
     Add the  object to the 
    object using its  method:

    Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each frame of your animation.

   Write the animated image to a file at any resolution using the
    .write[] method:

    a.write["animation.gif", 400, 400]Adds a new frame to the
      animation, represented by the  object.  This may
      also be an .
      
    write[filename, width,
       height]write[filename, width, height, insets]Writes the
      animation to the specified filename.  Currently, no matter what filename
      is specified, the format will be an animated GIF.  
      and  are integers.  If the insets are
      specified, they must be a number between 0 and 1 indicating how much of
      the image is filled by the graphics.  If  is 1, the
      graphics will fill the entire image with no border.

    Turns the animation
      into a base-64 encoded string in animated GIF format.
  
   Below is a small list of simple but interesting and powerful programs that
   demonstrate Frink's graphics.
  Prints graph paper with 1 cm and 1 mm grids.  Demonstrates
      exactly-sized printing.

    Loads a bitmap image and writes a semi-transparent
      watermark on it and then saves it back out to a file.  Demonstrates
      image loading, drawing over images, and saving image files
      at their original size.
      
    Draws a parabola and focal point for a small solar cooker that you can
    cut out and use to make a precisely-shaped mirror for cooking hot dogs and
    such.

    Draws simple, colorful spirals.  Fiddle with the numbers to make
      different, interesting patterns.

    
   Temperature scales that have their zero point (kelvin, Rankine) at absolute
   zero can be multiplied and converted normally.
  
   Temperature scales like Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Reaumur cannot be
   represented as normal multiplicative unit definitions because their zero
   point is not at absolute zero. 
   Thus, to avoid ambiguous "do what I mean" interpretation, you must use the
   functions  or the shorter
   ,  or the shorter
   , and  to convert to/from these
   temperature scales: 
  
   To represent a Fahrenheit temperature:
   or 505.9277777777778 K (temperature)
   To convert another temperature scale to Fahrenheit:
   or 
   To represent a Celsius temperature:
   or 
   To convert another temperature scale to Celsius:
   or 
   To convert between scales (short version):Fahrenheit[98.6] -> Celsius
   or
   This is equivalent to saying:Celsius[ Fahrenheit[98.6] ]
   or
   Except this way  turn the result into a string like the
    operator does.
   The units  and  only
   indicate the difference in the  of a degree in these various
   scales.  They should only be used when you're indicating the
    between two temperatures, (say, how much energy to
   raise the temperature of a gram of water by 5 degrees Celsius,)
    for absolute temperatures.  Conversely, the conversion
   functions above should  be used when the 
    between temperatures in two scales should be compared.
  
   The International System of Units (SI) considers the thermodynamic
   temperature in kelvin and the size of a degree in the kelvin system to have
   the same units.  See Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM
    (1967/68).  This means that you can use  as either an
   absolute thermodynamic temperature, or a temperature difference.  However,
   this implies that Frink can't automatically guarantee that "do what I mean"
   calculations with temperature are correct, as it would have to magically
   guess what you mean.
  
   One of the main design goals of Frink was to allow new sources of data to
   be added in very easily.  These special sources are not necessarily defined
   in the data file.  The three data
   sources listed below retrieve data on demand from up-to-the-minute data on
   the Internet (and thus require connection to the Internet.)
   This feature requires connection to the
   internet.  If you are using Frink on a handheld device, you may incur
   connection charges.  Also, since I cannot guarantee the availability of any
   internet sites, this feature is intended only as a bonus that may not work
   reliably if at all.  You may also require some
   proxy configuration if you use an FTP
   proxy server to access the web.
  
   The units "dollar" or "USD" indicate the value of a 
   U.S. dollar (which is arbitrarily chosen as the standard unit of currency.)
   Historical price data is available to allow comparisons between the
   historical "buying power" of U.S. currency.  This allows you to adjust
   historical prices for inflation.  These are represented by specially-named
   units containing both the currency and the year, separated by an
   underscore, for example:
  
   Since the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of
   Labor Statistics no longer maintains a machine-readable Consumer Price
   Index file, the file is fetched from the St. Louis Federal Reserve,
   specifically by
   parsing this file.
   The new data is also cached in each Frink jar file in case you don't have
   network connectivity.  Note that as of 2024-06-30, this file has been
   changed from a nice text file to a giant, poorly-formatted HTML file that
   is 10 times larger so it will cost everyone more time and money to
   download. They said this is "to make the table more accessible for our
   users."
  
   Data from 1700 to 1912 is based on some general economists' guesses and
   should be taken with a grain of salt.  U.S. data before 1700 is not
   available, and probably wouldn't be meaningful unless you could convert
   between the value of pelts, tinder, and tallow.
   The BLS web and FTP servers seem to have frequent
   outages, and historical data will not be available if the servers are down,
   or if you are not connected to the Internet.  Frink contains an internal
   cache of the CPI data in this case.
  
   From 1913-present, you can even use monthly resolution by indicating the
   month after the year.  Months are 2 digits and padded with zeros:
  
   Historical currency values can be converted to the current value.  For
   example to find today's cost of Mark Twain's passage to Europe and the Holy
   Land on the steamship  at a cost of $1250 in 1867
   (detailed in , the conversion of which was one of my first web projects):
  1250 dollar_1867 -> dollar
   And, you can add the 5 dollars/day in gold that they were encouraged to
   bring along to cover expenses for the 6-month trip:
  1250 dollar_1867 + 5 dollars_1867/day 6 months
    -> dollar
   You can translate from one year and month to another, if you have a
   DeLorean, and want to watch a Reagan movie:
  50 cents_1955_11 -> dollars_1985_10
   The units  or  or
    or  or
    or , or
    or  or 
   (the ISO-4217
   code for the U.K. Pound) indicate the  pound (but don't use
    by itself--that's a measure of mass.)  The exchange rate
   between the pound and all other world currencies, see below, is fetched
   live from the Internet.
  
   Historical price data is available to allow comparisons between the
   historical "buying power" of British currency, both pre- and
   post-decimalization.  Data goes back to the year 1245.  I don't know if
   data before this would be very meaningful.
  
   Historical currency values are represented by specially-named units
   containing both the currency and the year, separated by an underscore.  All
   can be used in the plural, ( or
    or  are all valid).  The
   following are examples of the plethora of values up to and including 1970
   (from 1971 on, it just became pounds and pence):
  A pound plus a shilling
      (21/20 pounds)
    13/6d (that is 13
      shillings and 6 pence) or 27/40 of a pound
    2 shillings or 1/10 pound
    1/12 shilling or 1/240 pound
    
   No wonder they went to decimalization.  It was either that or go to
   base-960 math.  
  
   To form combinations you can add them (using parentheses when necessary).
   For example, to convert a historical rate per day to current dollars/year:
  (4 pounds_1860 + 3 shilling_1860 + 5 pence_1860) / day
    -> dollars/year
   I acknowledge that's a bit cumbersome.
  
   So, you can find out what a great amount of money was
   involved when the British Parliament announced a 20,000 pound prize in 1714
   for solving the 
   Longitude Problem:
  20000 pound_1714 -> dollars
   Thanks to Dan Weiler who loaned me the above book which I never returned
   (and passed along to my Grandpa.)  Sorry, Dan, I'll buy you a book of your
   choice.
   This feature requires connection to the
   internet.  If you are using Frink on a handheld device, you may incur
   connection charges.  Also, since I cannot guarantee the availability of any
   internet sites, this feature is intended only as a bonus that may not work
   reliably if at all.  Java versions 1.6 and before may not be able to use
   this due to cryptography limitations (Java versions 1.6 and before cannot
   negotiate Diffie-Hellman key exchanges larger than 1024 bits.)  You may
   also require some proxy configuration if
   you use an HTTP proxy server to access the web.
  
   Current exchange rate between almost all of the world's currencies is
   available.  Exchange rates are fetched live from an allegedly zero-delay
   source on the Internet.  The currency can either be specified by the name
   of the country, by the 3-letter ISO-4217
   code for the currency, or by one of the combinations shown below.  The
   following examples all work:
  yen (this works because only Japan has a currency called "yen")
   United_Arab_Emirates_currency
   United_Arab_Emirates_Dirham
   
   To list all of the currencies, you can use:
   or, for a more nicely-formatted table with the currency names 
   their values:
  formatTable[unitsWithValues[currency]]
   So, I'm watching "The Amazing Race" and seeing a team pay 600 Baht in
   Thailand for a hotel room.  How much is that in a currency I'm familiar
   with?
  
   I could have also used  or 
   in the above example.
  
   You can also get the current trade rates of various precious metals
   (normalized from the obscure troy weights that these values are measured
   in.)  These are referenced using the  name (lower case
   brings up element properties for now... this will all be addressed when I
   add object-oriented behavior to Frink) or the 3-letter ISO code (which is
   an X followed by the chemical symbol):
  8765.9010519364188896 kg^-1 USD (price_per_mass)
   Note that this is in units of currency/mass (the international exchange
   rates for these are specified in dollars/troyounce, (but try to find that
   written somewhere)), but you can use any units of mass you want:
  7952291.666666666667 USD (currency)
   Or find out how much it would be worth to melt down that necklace:
  19.723277366856942501600 USD (currency) If you want to set a different base currency in your units
   file, and if you want currency conversions to still work, you should now)
   define the base currency as its 3-letter ISO-4217 currency code (say, "EUR"
   or "JPY").  This will allow the currency converter to unambiguously figure
   out which currency you mean.  The following special cases work as well:
  Euro symbol (Unicode )
    Japanese Yen symbol (Unicode )
    U.K. Pound symbol (Unicode )
  
   Frink has the magical ability to perform rigorous interval arithmetic
   throughout calculations.  So what is interval arithmetic?  Well, you can
   think of it as a "new kind of number" that represents a fuzzy range of
   values.  For example, you may know that a value lies between 1 and 2, but
   you're not quite sure where the value lies in that interval.  Depending on
   your philosophy, you can think of an interval as specifying a fuzzy error
   bound, or you can think of an interval as simultaneously taking on all
   values within its bounds.
  
   Frink can take this uncertain interval and propagate the uncertainty
   through its calculations, giving you the ability to see how the initial
   uncertainties in your values affect your final calculations.
  
   Currently, the way to indicate that something is an interval is to use the
    syntax (although something more concise will
   likely be added later, and the output format may change.)
  
    a = new interval[2,3]
    b = new interval[5,7]
   
   The intervals can then be manipulated in mathematical expressions, either
   with ordinary scalar variables or other intervals:
  
   Intervals may also have a "middle" or "main" value which indicates the
   best-known value.  Note that values should be specified in increasing
   order.
  
    d = new interval[2, 2.5, 3]
    e = new interval[7, 8.2, 9.4]
   Of course, all intervals used in a calculation must have "main" values or
   the main value will be dropped, creating an interval with only upper and
   lower bounds.
  
   Note:  The boundaries and "main" values for intervals must be real
   numbers.  (These numbers can also have dimensions like feet, meters, etc.)
   Although there is a theory of complex intervals, it's much harder and may
   not get implemented any time soon, (although a very generous Frink user sent
   a copy of a rare $200 textbook on complex interval arithmetic which will
   help that situation!  Thanks, Joshua!)
  
   Lest you think that intervals are simpler than they are, I find that people
   better understand them when they consider the following case:
  
   Now, let's square x.  Note that the values at each endpoint are equal to 4.
   However, over the range [-2,2], the value of x ranges from 4,
   down to 0 (at x=0), and back up to 4.  Frink does the right thing for the
   values over this whole range:
  
   Yeah, that  cool.  Frink tracks appropriate boundaries for
   intervals throughout all of your calculations.
  
   Frink's interval arithmetic is also rigorous in its treatment of error
   bounds.  It painstakingly controls the rounding direction of arithmetic
   operations so that the boundaries are guaranteed to include the
   next-largest or next-smallest representable floating-point number that
   contains the interval.  (See notes below on implementation status.)  This
   is subtle, but I have spent a lot of work ensuring that the boundaries came
   out trustable, and no bigger than need be. For example:
  m = new interval[3,6]
    1.0/m[0.16666666666666666666, 0.33333333333333333334]
   Note that the bottom bound is rounded down, and the top bound is rounded
   up.
  
   Currently, almost all functions have been made interval-aware.
   Implementing all functions  will take quite
   a bit of effort.  Of course, that would be much slower, too.  Error bounds
   are unfortunately not "sharp" for all operations (meaning as tight as they
   could possibly be with limited precision.)  I've noted them as such in the
   Interval Arithmetic Status section
   below.
  
   Not all operators such as  make unambiguous sense
   when applied to intervals, so Frink has introduced new operators to
   disambiguate these cases, and will implement other operators to work with
   intervals.  See the Interval
    Comparison Operators section below for more details.
  
   By default, degenerate intervals which have the same upper and lower bounds
   are "collapsed" into a single real number.  If you want to maintain them as
   intervals, call the function  before
   constructing or performing mathematics on those intervals.
  
   As everyone uses Interval Arithmetic for the first time, they come upon two
   characteristic problems in the field:  the dependence problem and the
   overestimation problem.  These are common to all interval analysis, and not
   just to Frink, and are covered in extensive detail in the Interval Arithmetic section of the
    Frink FAQ.
   For more information about the field of Interval Arithmetic, please visit
   the Interval Computations
   website. (Link opens in new window.)

  
   Interval arithmetic is an incredibly powerful feature that allows programs
   that weren't necessarily written with intervals in mind to track error
   bounds throughout your calculations, and can be magically applied to
   programs that are already written.  For example, let's take some
   calculations to find the volume and density of a sphere:
  
    circumference = eval[input["Enter circumference of a sphere: "]]
    mass = eval[input["Enter the mass of the sphere: "]]
    diameter = circumference / pi
    radius = diameter / 2
    density = mass / volume
    println["The density is: " + (density -> "g/cm^3")]
   
   Now, you can run the program and enter something like "9.1 inches" for the
   circumference and "5.1 ounces" for the mass and find out the density of your
   baseball.  No surprises there.  But when you read the rules of Major League
   Baseball, you'll find that section 1.09 states:
  
    "The ball shall be a sphere formed by yarn wound around a small core of
    cork, rubber or similar material, covered with two stripes of white
    horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together. It shall weigh not less
    than five nor more than 5 1/4 ounces avoirdupois and measure not less than
    nine nor more than 9 1/4 inches in circumference."
   
   So, using your exact same program above, and a little interval input,
   Frink can calculate the effects of these allowed variations and show you
   the allowed range of densities of  legal baseball:
  Enter circumference of a sphere:new interval[9, 9+1/4] inchesEnter the mass of the sphere:new interval[5, 5+1/4] ouncesThe density is: [0.64720283343427980773,
    0.73778085086685322066] g/cm^3
   The output indicates the range of uncertainties.  Note that two different
   intervals were used to perform this calculation, and the effects of their
   uncertainties was automatically tracked throughout all calculations.  All
   this in a program that wasn't even written with intervals in mind.
   Unscrupulous teams may also not that the official definition allows for a
    variation in allowable densities of baseballs, which could
   be manipulated to your advantage.
  
   Also note that I put the units of measure (e.g. inches, ounces) outside the
   brackets.  You could put them inside the brackets, but you'd just have to
   write them twice in this case.  Intervals can, of course, contain units of
   measure.
  
   By the way, I'm working on a more concise notation for specifying
   intervals.
  
   The relational operators (e.g. , etc) work with
   intervals, but there are many ambiguous cases.  These operators try to Do
   The Right Thing when applied to intervals.  If you compare intervals that
   do not overlap, they return the appropriate result.  If, however, the
   intervals  overlap, they terminate the program with an error
   similar to the following:

  
    Comparison expression: Using operator > to compare intervals [1, 3]
    and [2, 4]
    This operator is only defined if there is no overlap between intervals.
    Please modify your program to use interval-aware comparison operators.
   
   To handle the overlapping cases, Frink defines operators like "certainly
   less than" () and "possibly less than" ().
   These operators can directly replace the normal relational operators.
   These new operators also work with normal real numbers, so you can still
   write programs that run using either intervals or real numbers as input.
  Certainly less-than-or-equal-to
    Certainly greater-than-or-equal-to
    Possibly less-than-or-equal-to
    Possibly greater-than-or-equal-to
  
    a = new interval[1,3]
    b = new interval[2,4]
   The “possibly” and “certainly” operators are related to each other by the
   following property: The “possibly” operator is the inverse of the opposite
   “certainly” operator. For example,  (possibly less than) is
   the inverse of the  (certainly greater than or equal)
   operator.  That is, when 
   returns ,  returns  and
   vice versa.
  
   As noted above, not all functions are implemented for intervals.  The
   following table notes the status of the implementation of various operators
   and functions.  If a function does not appear on this list, it may still
   return values for interval arguments, but you shouldn't trust it because I
   haven't evaluated it for discontinuities or non-monotonicity yet.

    a = new interval[now[], now[] + 3 days]
    b = new interval[#1969-08-19#, #2005-06-11#]
   Missing a function that you need?  Frink can directly call Java code to let
   you take advantage of any Java library that's in your classpath.  Thus, you
   can use your favorite graphing package, connect to a database, perform
   lower-level networking, and more, directly from within Frink.
  
   Java objects can be manipulated just like Frink objects, by calling their
   methods or accessing their fields:
    Note that method calls on Java objects use square
   brackets, as they do in all Frink function and method calls:
  
   Java objects that implement the interfaces
   , , or
    can be used as a Frink enumerating
   expression, allowing them to be used in  loops or other
   places that allow enumerating expressions.
  
   The Java  will be converted to/from the Frink type
   .
  
   New Java objects can be created with the 
   and newJava[classname, argList] functions.  These call Java
   constructors with the specified arguments.  If the constructor takes a
   single argument,  can be a single value, otherwise it
   should be an array of values.  If the constructor takes no arguments, then
   the last argument can be eliminated entirely.  The following creates a new
   Frame and calls some methods on the Frame to display it.  Note that the
   method calls require square brackets.
  f = newJava["javax.swing.JFrame", "Frink Rules!"]
    f.setSize[200,200]
    f.toFront[]
   Arrays of Java objects, including primitives, can be constructed with the
   newJavaArray[, ]
   method.
  
    d = newJavaArray["byte", 1024]
    d@0 = 0x65
   
   The classname should
   be a string containing either be a fully-qualified classname
   (e.g. ) or a primitive type name,
   (e.g.  or ).  Elements of Java
   arrays are addressed the same way as other arrays.
  
   Multi-dimensional arrays of Java objects can be created by the same
   function, but with an array of integers specifying the size of each
   dimension.  For example, the following creates a two-dimensional array of
    with dimensions 3 by 4:
  
    d = newJavaArray["double", [3,4]]
    d@0@0 = 3.14
   
   The initial value of all of the elements of a new Java array can be
   specified with the three-argument version of the
   function: newJavaArray[, , ]:
  
    d = newJavaArray["double", [3,4], 3.14]
   Yes, this is  simpler than doing the same thing in Java!
  
   The methods on a Java object can be listed using the
    function:
  
    f = newJava["javax.swing.JFrame", [] ]
    sort[methods[f]]
   
   This makes it easy to experiment with Java libraries without writing
   extensive unnecessary boilerplate code, recompiling, etc.  Frink has been
   called "an easier Java than Java."
  
   If you don't have an instance of the class, you can call static methods in
   Java classes using the callJava[classname, methodname, argList]
   function.  The following uses the  class to
   generate a random number.
  n = callJava["java.lang.Math", "random", [] ]
   If the method requires no arguments, as in the above example, the last
   argument can be eliminated:
  n = callJava["java.lang.Math", "random"]
   Lame example, huh?  Especially when Frink can already generate random
   numbers.  The same syntax can be used to get a database driver, or
   something more interesting.
  
   You can access static variables in a class without having an instance of
   the class by calling the staticJava[classname, fieldname]
   function.
  green = staticJava["java.awt.Color", "GREEN"]JavaObject:java.awt.Color
   You can then call methods on that object:
  
   If you've constructed a Frame as in the Creating Java Objects section above, you
   can set its background color by:
  
   As of the 2014-04-21 release, Frink turns values returned from
    into their corresponding Frink types.  If you need
   the original, raw Java object (say, for code that checks object identity,)
   then you can call the three-argument version of the function, passing
    as the third argument (this indicates that the value
   should  be mapped to a Frink type):
  staticJava["javax.swing.SwingConstants", "LEFT"]staticJava["javax.swing.SwingConstants", "LEFT", false]JavaObject:java.lang.Integer
   Sometimes you may have to call functions or methods by name.  For example,
   calling a method called  on a Java object
   is impossible in Frink because  is a reserved word and
   produces a syntax error!  To get around this, use the
   callByName[, , ]
   function.
  callByName[iterator, "next", [] ]
   If the first argument (normally an object) is , then the
   function with the specified name will be called.
  
   If the argument list is empty, as above, you can eliminate it entirely:
  callByName[iterator, "next"]
   If the argument list is a single element, you don't have to pass it as a
   list: 
  callByName[undef, "println", "yo"]
   Similarly, you can get a reference to a function by calling
   getFunction[, ] which returns a
   reference to the function with the specified name (specified as a string)
   and number of arguments.  This can then be assigned to variables, or called
   as noted in the Anonymous Functions
   section of the documentation.
  
   The  loop can be used to iterate over the contents of most
   Java collections, including , ,
   , , ,
   , (which includes ,
   ,  etc.), 
   (which includes almost  types in Java,
   and anything that can be used in Java's  statement)
   
   For most Java collections, you can iterate through the contents using a
    loop (which is really just a "for each" loop.)
  
    for a = 
       println[a]
   If the Java class implements the  interface (this
   includes classes like , ,
   , etc), it can be treated like a Frink dictionary.  This includes enumerating over
    pairs:
  
    for [key,value] = 
       println["$key maps to $value"]
   All of these Java collections can be treated as enumerating expressions in
   Frink, so all of the functions and methods that can operate on enumerating
   expressions can operate on Java collections.  For example, Java collections
   can be converted to other types using functions like
   , , , or
   manipulated with functions like , etc.
  
   If you are using a Java data structure that puts Frink or Java data types
   into a data structure that needs a  to
   perform the comparisons (,)
   you can get Frink's default Comparator (which follows the same semantics as
   Frink's three-way
   comparison operator,) by calling .
   Frink's default comparator will also compare Java objects that implement
   the  interface so it can be used for Frink
   and Java data types.
  
   You can also implement a  that uses a
   Frink function to perform the comparison.  The function should take two
   arguments  and return -1 if a<b, 0 if a==b, and 1 if
   a>b
  c = new Comparator[ {|a,b| a <=> b } ]
   If additional data is needed to perform the comparison, you can pass an
   arbitrary expression as the second argument of the Comparator constructor.
   This data will be passed as a third argument to the function.  For example,
   the following Comparator sorts the elements by their distance from 20.
  c = new Comparator[ {|a,b,data| abs[a-data] <=> abs[b-data] }, 20]
   Not only can you call Java from Frink, but you can call Frink from Java.
   It's quite easy to embed a Frink parser into any Java program and give
   those programs all of the power of Frink.  It can take just a few lines of
   Java:
  //At the top of your file...
    import frink.parser.Frink;
    Frink interp = new Frink();
    // Enable security here?  Currently commented-out.
    // interp.setRestrictiveSecurity(true);
    {
       results = interp.parseString("2+2");
    }
    catch (frink.errors.FrinkEvaluationException fee)
    {
       // Do whatever you want with the exception
    }: Frink is a Turing-complete programming language, and
    evaluates a string as a complete program.  A
   Frink interpreter normally has the ability to read your filesystem, call
   arbitrary Java code, execute infinite loops, allocate infinite amounts of
   memory, write large amounts of output, and do other things which may
   compromise your security.  Thus, if you're taking input from
   untrusted users, it's critical to call:

  .setRestrictiveSecurity(true);
   before parsing any user input.  This will enable the highest
   level of security, prohibiting all untrusted actions.
  
   There are more methods for calling Frink from within a Java program.  One
   of the major problems is that converting from Frink types to Java types is
   almost always a narrowing operation.
  
   For example, if you try to put a Frink value into a Java integer:
  It could be a non-integer (rational number, floating point).

   It may have wrong unit types.

   It could be something else like a String or an Object.
  
   As a result, all of these interface methods throw a variety of exceptions.
  
   If you're interested in integrating Frink into your company's products,
   please contact Alan Eliasen.
  
   The following sections demonstrates some of the real-world calculations I've
   made with Frink.
  
   Let's say you wanted to fill your bedroom up with water.  How much water
   would it take?  Let's say your room measures 10 feet by 12 feet wide by
   8 feet high.
  10 feet 12 feet 8 feet -> gallons552960/77 (approx. 7181.298701298701)
   It would take approximately 7181 gallons to fill it.  Note that you get
   both an exact fraction and an approximation.  (If you don't want to see the
   fraction, put a decimal point in any of the numbers, like 
   or  .)
   How much would that weigh, if you filled it with water?  Frink has the unit
   "water" which stands for the density of water.
  10. feet 12 feet 8 feet water -> pounds
   So it would weigh almost 60,000 pounds.  What if you knew that your floor
   could only support 2 tons?  How deep could you fill the room with water?
  2. tons / (10 feet 12 feet water) -> feet
   So you could only fill it about 0.53 feet deep.  It'll be a pretty sad pool
   party.
  
   You can set variables on the fly, by using the assignment
    operator.  Let's say you want to define a new unit
   representing the amount of alcohol in a can of (quality) 3.2 beer.  Keep in
   mind that 3.2 beer is measured by alcohol/weight, while almost all other
   liquors (and many beers) are usually measured in alcohol/volume.  The
   density ratio between water and alcohol is given by:
  
   Water is thus 1.267 times denser than alcohol.  3.2 beer (measured by
   weight) is thus actually 4.0 percent alcohol as measured by volume.  Now
   let's set that variable in terms of a beer's density of alcohol per volume
   so we can compare:
  beer = 12 floz 3.2 percent water/alcohol
   Then, you wanted to find out how many beers a big bottle of champagne is
   equal to:
  magnum 13.5 percent -> beer
   You probably don't want to drink that whole bottle.  Now let's say you're
   mixing Jungle Juice (using a 1.75 liter bottle of Everclear (190 proof!))
   and Kool-Aid to fill a 5-gallon bucket (any resemblance to my college
   parties is completely intentional.)  What percent alcohol is that stuff?
  junglejuice = 1.75 liter 190 proof / (5 gallon)
    junglejuice -> "percent"8.78372074090843481138500000 percent
   It's really not  strong.  About 8.8%.  But if you drink 5 cups
   of that, at 12 fluid ounces each, how many beers have you had?
  5 12 floz junglejuice -> "beer"
   Maybe that's why people were getting punched in the head.  
   Some more useful calculations, most thanks to the lovely Steve Clymer:
  
   How many cases in a keg?  (A keg is a normal-sized keg, what those in the
   beer industry would call a "half barrel," or  in
   Frink notation.  I don't think they sell full barrels.  I've never seen
   one.  It would weigh 258 pounds.  A "pony keg" is a "quarter barrel" or, in
   Frink notation,  or )
  62/9 (approx. 6.888888888888889)
   How many 12 fluid ounce drinks ( cans o' beer) in a keg?
  496/3 (approx. 165.33333333333334)
   What is the price in dollars per fluid ounce of alcohol when buying a keg of
   3.2 beer?  (Remember that 3.2 beer is measured in alcohol/weight, so we
   correct by the density ratio of  to get alcohol by
   volume:)
  (60 dollars)/(keg 3.2 percent water/alcohol) -> "dollars/floz"
   A bottle of cheap wine?  (A "winebottle" is the standard 750 ml size.)
  (6.99 dollars)/(winebottle 13 percent) -> "dollars/floz"
   A big plastic bottle of really bad vodka?
  (13.99 dollars)/(1750 ml 80 proof) -> "dollars/floz"0.59104811225625 dollars/floz
   In the movie , the alien mother ship is said to be
   500 km in diameter and have a mass 1/4 that of earth's moon.  If the mother
   ship were a sphere, what would its density be?  (The volume of a sphere is
   4/3 pi radius)
  1/4 moonmass / (4/3 pi (500/2 km)^3) -> water
   This makes the ship  denser than water.  This is 36 times
   denser than iron and more than 12 times denser than any known element!  As
   the ship is actually more a thin disc than a sphere, it would actually be
   even denser.  Since it contains lots of empty space, parts of it would have
   to be much, much denser.
  
   If the object is this dense and has such a large mass, what is its surface
   gravity?  Surface gravity is given by G mass / radius, where G
   is the gravitational constant (which Frink knows about):
  G 1/4 moonmass / (500/2 km)^2 -> gravity
   The surface gravity of the spaceship is thus at least 
   earth's gravity--and that's on the rim where gravity is weakest.  It
   would actually be much higher since it's much, much flatter than a sphere.
   I hope you're not the alien that has to go outside and paint it.
  
   You can calculate the day that your company will run out of cash, based on
   their financial statements.  The following is an example for a real company,
   based on SEC filings, which read as the following:
  Cash and Cash Equivalents (in thousands)
   To make this more readable, you can define variables to hold values:
  burnrate = (#2001-06-30# - #2000-12-31#) / ((86481 - 41601) thousand dollars)
   You can calculate the number of days until the money runs out at this rate:
  41601 thousand dollars / burnrate ->
    "days"
   Using date/time math, starting from the last report date (June 30,
   2001) you can find out the exact date this corresponds to:

   Just in time to see the cinema release of the first  movie with your last six bucks.  Will they know it's
   Christmas Time at all?
  
   At the moment, I'm watching CNN which is discussing some land-mines used in
   Afghanistan.  They showed a very small mine (about the size of a bran
   muffin) containing "51 grams of TNT" and they asked how much destructive
   force that carries.  Frink's data file includes how much energy is in a
   mass of TNT, specified by the unit "TNT".  How many feet in the air could
   51 grams of TNT throw me, assuming perfect efficiency, and knowing
   energy = mass * gravity * height?
  51 grams TNT -> 185 pounds gravity feet
   Yikes.  937 feet.  But the only difference between explosives and other
   combustible fuels is the rapidity of combustion, not in the quantity of
   energy.  How much gasoline contains the same amount of energy?
  51 grams TNT -> "teaspoons gasoline"1.2903255 teaspoons gasoline
   1.29 teaspoons?  That's not much at all.  You're buying a huge amount of
   energy when you fill up your car.

   I can't watch  (or lots of other television shows)
   without having Frink at my side.  This week the team has to float a
   submerged half-ton Cooper Mini... how many oil barrels will they need to
   use as floats?
  half ton -> barrels water
   They're trying to hand-pump air down to the barrels, submerged "2
   fathoms" below the water.  If the guy can sustain 40 watts of pumping
   power, how many minutes will it take to fill the barrel?
  2 fathoms water gravity barrel -> 40 watts minutes
   And how many food Calories (a food Calorie (with a capital 'C') equals 1000
   calories with a small 'c') will he burn to fill a barrel?
  2 fathoms water gravity barrel -> Calories
   Better eat a Tic-Tac first.
  
   I've seen lots of figures about how much heat the human body produces.  You
   can easily calculate the upper limit based on how much food you eat a day.
   Say, you eat 2000 Calories a day (again, food Calories with a capital "C"
   are equal to 1000 calories with a little "c".)
  2000 Calories/day -> watts
   So, your average power and/or heat output is slightly less than a 100-watt
   bulb.  (Note that your heat is radiated over a much larger area so the
   temperature is much lower.)  Many days I could be replaced entirely with a
   100-watt bulb and have no discernible effect on the universe.
  
   I'm heating up yummy mustard greens in my microwave, but I don't want to
   overheat them.  I just want to warm them up.  If I run my 1100 watt
   microwave for 30 seconds, how much will their temperature increase?  I have
   a big 27 ounce (mass) can, and I'll assume that their specific heat is about
   the same as that of water (1 calorie/gram/degC):
  1100 W 30 sec / (27 oz 1 calorie/gram/degC) -> degF
   30 seconds should raise the temperature by no more than 18 degrees
   Fahrenheit, assuming perfect transfer of microwave energy to heat.
  
   Knowing this, I could see how efficiently my microwave 
   heats food.  I could heat a quantity of water and measure the temperature
   change in the water.  I'll do that sometime if I can find my good
   thermometer.
  
   Superman is always rescuing school buses that are falling off of cliffs,
   flying to the moon, lifting cars over his head, and generally showing off.
   So why does he still allow so many accidents to happen?  Shouldn't he be
   able to rescue  who has a Volkswagen parked on their
   chest?
  
   While searching for answers, I found out three interesting things about
   Superman:
  He's 6 feet 3 inches tall.
   He gets his strength from being charged up with solar energy.
  
   This is enough information to find some answers.  Frink has units called
    (the total power radiated by the sun) and
    (the distance between the earth and the sun.)  Thus,
   we can find the sun's power that strikes an area at the distance of the
   earth (knowing the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi radius):
  earthpower = sunpower / (4 pi sundist^2)
   This is about 1372 watts per square meter.  Superman is a pretty big
   guy--let's say the surface area he can present to the sun is 12 square
   feet.  (This is probably a bit high--it makes him an average of 23 inches
   wide over his entire height.)  This allows Superman to charge up at a power
   of:
  chargerate = earthpower 12 ft^2
   Superman thus charges up at the rate of 1530 joules/sec or 1530 watts.  At
   this rate, how long does he have to charge up before he can lift a 2 ton
   truck over his head?  (Knowing energy = mass * height * gravity)
  2 ton 7 feet gravity / chargerate -> sec
   So, charging up for 25 seconds allows him to save one dumb kid who is acting
   as a speed bump.  So his power is huge but not infinite.  He couldn't
   sustain a higher rate (unless he showed off less by lifting the car only a
   foot or two.)  Lifting a truck every 30 seconds or so isn't bad,
   though.  He could be saving a lot more people.  So why doesn't he?
  
   Well, we've all seen the movie.  He's using his super-powers to pick up
   chicks.  Literally.  Superman decides to take a break from saving lives and
   takes Lois Lane up in the sky for a joyride.  So how long does he have to
   charge up with solar energy to fly himself and Lois Lane (let's say she
   weighs 135 pounds) up to 15,000 feet?
  (225 + 135) pounds 15000 feet gravity / chargerate -> minutes
   So, Superman has to charge up with solar energy for an  to
   cart Lois up there.  With the same energy, he could have saved over 120
   trapped kids.  Keep in mind that Lois could do her part, too.  If she left
   her camera or big clunky shoes behind, he'd have more energy left over
   to save people.  If she would manage to leave behind just two pounds of
   cargo weight, Superman would have enough energy to save another kid's life.
  
   Sure, he's a great guy, and, sure, he's the Defender of Truth, Justice, and
   the American Way, but can't he find a better use for his super-powers than
   schlepping some shiksa into the stratosphere?  Shovel my walk, he could, in
   3 seconds--and me with the sciatica.
  
   I received one of those endlessly-forwarded e-mails of dubious but
   "interesting facts" which said "if you fart continuously for 6 years and 9
   months, you'll have enough gas to create the equivalent of an atomic bomb."
   Hee hee.  Cute.  (Thanks to Heather May Howard... being unable to easily
   calculate the veracity of this statement was one of the primary influences
   that showed how existing programs were too limited and inspired the
   creation of Frink.)  But I didn't believe it and wanted to check it.  The
   Hiroshima bomb had a yield of 12.5 kilotons of TNT, which is a very small
   bomb by today's standards.  How many horsepower would that be?
  12.5 kilotons TNT / (6 years + 9 months) -> horsepower
   Can  produce a 329-horsepower blowtorch of a fart?  I doubt it.
   That's the power produced by a Corvette engine running just at its melting
   point.  A one-second fart with that much power could blow me 1000 feet
   straight up.  To produce that kind of energy, how much food would you have
   to eat a day?
  12.5 kilotons TNT / (6 years + 9 months) -> Calories/day
   Ummm... can  eat over 5 million Calories a day?  (Again, note
   that these are  Calories with a capital 'c' which are equal to
   1000 calories with a small 'c'.)  If you were a perfect fart factory,
   converting food energy into farts with 100% efficiency, and ate a normal
   2000 Calories/day, how many years would it  take?
  12.5 kilotons TNT / (2000 Calories/day) -> years
   17,000 years is still a huge underestimate; I don't know how much of your
   energy actually goes into fart production.  Oh well.  To continue the
   calculations, let's guess your butthole has a diameter of 1 inch (no,
    go measure it.)  Let's also guess that the gas you actually
   produce in a fart is only 1/10 as combustible as pure natural gas.  What
   would be the velocity of the gas coming out?
  12.5 kilotons TNT / natural_gas / (6 years + 9 months)
    / (pi (.5 in)^2) 10 -> mph
   Nobody likes sitting next to a 280-mile-per-hour fart-machine.
    Even the smallest atomic bombs are  powerful and whoever originally calculated this isn't any
   fun to be around if they really fart that much.
  
   Fart jokes.  Sheesh.  If Frink isn't a huge success, it's not because I
   didn't pander to the Lowest Common Denominator.
  
   The above order-of-magnitude estimate shows how far off the mark that the
   fart e-mail was.  Not content with that, I found some medical studies that
   allowed me to do a more detailed analysis of the average person's available
   fart energy.
  
   What do you think are the most flammable gases in a fart?  Most people
   think it's methane, but I found some medical studies that disprove this.
   Most people hardly have  methane in their intestines.  For
   example, one study stated that only 4 out of 11 people had any detectable
   methane in their intestines!  So what's the rest of the gas?
  
   These studies also note that the average person has 100 milliliters of gas
   present in their intestinal tract at any given time.  The average person
   expels 400-2000 ml of gas daily (and I'm not talking about through the
   mouth and nose.)
  
   Okay, that's almost enough information to figure out available fart energy.
   Now all we need to know is the energy of combustion of the flammable gases.
   Of the above, only hydrogen and methane are readily combustible.  Looking
   up their energies of combustion:
  Energy of Combustion in kJ/mol
    
   Okay, that's plenty enough information to find out how much energy is
   released in a day of farting!  Say you're on the farty end of the scale,
   and you produce the 2000 ml of gas each day.
  
   Note that the energies above are given in kJ/mol, but we have volumes in
   milliliters.  As you may have learned in chemistry class, a mole of any gas
   at standard temperature and pressure takes up the same volume.  Frink knows
   this as .
  
   The total energy in the hydrogen (keeping in mind that hydrogen makes up
   19% of the 2000 ml volume) is given by:
  h2energy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 19 percent * 285.8 kJ/mol4845.3656205695224816 m^2 s^-2 kg (energy)
   The combustible hydrogen thus produces 4800 joules (per day.)  Now, for the
   methane, which makes a smaller percentage, but releases more energy per
   mole:
  methaneenergy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 3.2 percent * 890.8 kJ/mol2543.5537223989278488 m^2 s^-2 kg (energy)
   The energy in the combustible methane is thus about 2500 joules (per day),
   about half the energy produced from the hydrogen.  Thus, the grand total of
   energy produced by combustible farts by a farty person in a day, in food
   Calories (with a capital C, remember--these are what a physicist would call
   a kilocalorie) is:
  methaneenergy + h2energy -> Calories
   Which gives a result of about 1.76 Calories/day of energy available from
   burning your farts.  (About 1.16 Calories from hydrogen, and about 0.60
   Calories from methane.)  This is out of the 2000 Calories that an average
   person eats a day.  Or, one part in about 1133 of the energy in the food
   you eat is available in fart energy, (again, for a gassy person.)
  
   Thus, a good estimate to the problem stated above is that a real (gassy)
   human would need to save their farts for:

  12.5 kilotons TNT / ((methaneenergy + h2energy) / day)
    -> years
   or about  to make the equivalent of the energy in
   a (small) atomic bomb!  So the estimate given in that e-mail is off by a
   factor of at least 2.8 million!
  
   Now, you know the true facts about farts.  Frink is now complete, and I
   couldn't be prouder.  Umm... thanks, Heather May.
  
   That e-mail has a higher density of incorrect facts than just about
   anything I've seen.  Below are several more examples.
  
   "The cruise liner, Queen Elizabeth II, moves only six inches for each gallon
   of diesel that it burns."
  
   From a page of
   facts about the QE2, we find that the ship consumes 18 tons of fuel per
   hour at a service speed of 28 knots.  By legislation in many areas, diesel
   fuel must have a density no higher than 0.85 kg/liter (if it were watered
   down, it would be higher.)
  18 tons/hour / (28 knot) / (.85 kg/liter) -> feet/gallonWarning: reciprocal conversion
    33.52338503156235
   They're very, very wrong.  It actually travels about 33.5 feet per gallon,
   or 157 gallons/mile.  They're only off by a factor of 67.  Still not great
   gas mileage, though.
  
   The same e-mail states "pound for pound, hamburgers cost more than new
   cars."
  
   Let's see... let's try with a medium-expensive, light car.  A
   2001 Corvette Z06 weighs 3,115 pounds and costs $48,055.
  (48055 dollars) / (3115 lb) -> dollars/lb1373/89 (approx. 15.426966292134832)
   I know  don't pay $15/lb for hamburger.
  
   Let's try with a light, very cheap car.  A quick lookup showed that a 2001
   Hyundai Accent costs $10,184 and weighs 2255 pounds.  That's still $4.51 a
   pound.  Do  pay that much for hamburger?  Maybe a finished
   hamburger in a good restaurant, certainly not for hamburger.  This is
   deceptive if not outright wrong.
  
   By the way, did you ever notice that in the movie  that
   Gordie  gets ripped off for hamburger?  Supposedly set in
   1960, Gordie buys "a buck and a half of hamburger" which is slapped down in
   a tiny wrapper that couldn't contain more than 3/4 of a pound.  Probably a
   half pound--it looks like all wrapper.  (You estimate it.)  Converting to
   modern prices:
  1.50 dollars_1960 / (.75 lb) -> dollars/lb
   Gordie paid a modern equivalent of $27/lb for that hamburger.  Perhaps a
   smarter shopper  have gotten more for Vern's 7 cents.
  
   The same e-mail says "the longest word that can be typed using only the
   left hand is 'stewardesses'."  Well, Frink is good for doing word stuff
   too.  Using the single word list from the 
   Moby wordlist,
   the following program finds lots of 12-letter alternatives, and several
   longer:
  
    infile = ""leftPattern = %r/^[qwertasdfgzxcvb]+$/i
    matches = select[lines[infile], leftPattern]
    sort[matches, { |a,b| length[a] <=> length[b] } ]
       println[length[line] + ": $line"]
   
   (Actually, my original program was only 2 lines, but this is easier to
   read.  The program could be written lots of ways.)  Some of the results are:
  
    12: stewardesses
    12: desegregates
    12: watercresses
    12: decerebrated
    12: desegregated
    12: tessaradecad
    12: reaggregated
    12: reverberates
    12: aftereffects
    13: aftercataract
    17: redrawerredrawers
   I have no idea what that last word means.
  
   So you want to build an ark, do you?  And not an Ark of the Covenant, but
   the boat.  How bad was that flood?
  
   The bible is also quite precise in its measurement of the flood.  Genesis
   7:19-20 states that "And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth;
   and all the mountains, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
   Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
   covered."
  
   Okay, so the highest mountains of the earth were covered, plus an extra 15
   cubits (approx 27 feet) for good measure.  The current measurements for
   highest mountain is Mt. Everest at 29030.8 feet (according to the highly
   dubious and utterly non-trustable 2002 Guinness Book of World Records.)  I
   know that Everest is growing slowly, (best estimates are 2.4 inches/year)
   so we'll discount for that.
  
    depth = 29030 feet + 15 biblicalcubits - (2.4 inches/year 4000 years)
   
   About 28257 feet of water.  This was deposited over 40 days.  The rainfall
   was thus:
  rainfall = depth / (40 days)
   Or about 353 inches/hour, or 29 feet/hour.  A good rain around here is
   about an inch an hour.  The very rainiest places on earth like Cherrapunji
   get about this much rain in a .  (I'm campaigning Colorado
   farmers to sin a bit more...)
  
   Everyone knows Einstein's E=mc equation, but to apply it is
   often very difficult because the units come out so strange.  Let's see, I
   have mass in pounds, and the speed of light is 186,282
   miles/second... ummm... what does that come out to?  In Frink the
   calculation becomes transparently simple.
  
   If you took the matter in a teaspoon of water, and converted that to
   energy, how many gallons of gasoline would that equal?
  teaspoon water c^2 -> "gallons gasoline"3164209.862836101 gallons gasoline
   Unbelievable.  The energy in a teaspoon of water, if we could extract it,
   is equal to burning more than 3  gallons of gasoline.
  
   The November 2001 edition of  magazine has a
   charming article called "Stellar Guides for Your Birthday" by Jeff
   A. Farinacci (p. 63), which provides a list of "nearby" stars and their
   distances in light-years or light-days.  This allows you to look at the
   light coming from a star that was emitted the day you were born.  It
   includes a 28-line
   BASIC program,  to calculate how many days old
   you are on a certain date. 
   As you know by now, the essential calculation can be done in one line of
   Frink.  For example, the bright star Pollux is about 33.7 light-years away
   (12314 days, based on the Hipparcos satellite's parallax measurement of
   96.74 milliarcseconds) and the light it emitted on the day I was born will
   finally reach earth on the date:
  #1969-08-19# + 12314 daysAD 2003-05-07 12:00:00.000 AM (Wed) Mountain Daylight Time
   or, to calculate the date directly from the parallax, we can use the
   following, where  is an astronomical unit (the average
   distance between the earth and the sun,) and  is the speed of
   light, the values of which are known to Frink:
  #1969-08-19# + au / (96.74 milliarcsec) / c
   This gives the same date as the calculation above (May 7, 2003.)  I was
   amazed to find that the universe has conspired to produce a beautiful
   conjunction on this date.  Pollux will form a straight line with the moon
   and Jupiter in the western sky on that night:
  
   (Note:  The three objects aren't as close together as it may look in this
   picture.  The sky is big.)  These screenshots show how it will look at 10 PM
   Mountain Daylight Time.
  
   Below is a 45-degree chunk of sky looking due west.  This will give you a
   better idea of how the sky will look as you face west.  You'll probably see
   Pollux and Castor quite clearly.  Castor is the bright star directly
   to the right of Pollux.  Castor and Pollux will appear to make a horizontal
   line at this time.
  
   It shouldn't be hard to find.  Look west.  The moon will be the brightest
   object in the sky, and Jupiter will be the second-brightest.  Follow the
   line from Jupiter to the moon.  Pollux is by far the brightest star along
   that line (it has a dimmer twin Castor, which will be on the right.)  The
   moon is in the center and Jupiter and Pollux are equal distances on either
   side of the moon.  Follow the wise men.  Bring gold.  I already have lots
   of frankincense and myrrh.
  : This article also underlines one of the
   things I am growing to miss in most physical equations and all programs
   written in other languages... the loss of units.  Everything is an
   unexplained number, and inscrutable conversion factors are strewn liberally
   throughout.  This is exactly the type of thing that Frink was designed to
   address.  For example, a line in the article indicates:
  The parallax-to-distance formula is simple: d=1/p, where p is the
    parallax angle in arcseconds and d is the distance in parsecs (3.26
    light-years).
   This description is unfortunate.  1 divided by an angle (which is
   dimensionless) is still dimensionless,  a distance.  This is
   better specified by saying that the formula is distance=(orbital
   radius)/(parallax angle).  Since the parallax angles are specified with
   respect to Earth's orbital radius, you can write the equation as
   . "" is an astronomical
   unit, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is included
   in Frink's standard data file.  Then, p can be specified in 
   angular units and distance can be automatically converted to light-years or
   light-days instead of parsecs (or into feet, if you want).  As always,
   Frink makes the units of measurement transparent, and helps to ensure
   that your calculations make sense. So, using the Hipparcos
   satellite's measurements for the parallax of the closest star, Proxima
   Centauri (okay, second-closest, smartypants):
  au / (.7723 arcsec) -> lightyears
   This way, we learn something about the  of the physical
   calculation which we can generalize, rather than having an equation that
   only works with one weird system of measurement.  (Although professional
   astronomers like to use parsecs, I think it's a horrible, intentionally
   exclusive, geocentric measurement and they're just being difficult.  There
   was even an article in  a while back which
   intimated that some astronomers would sneer and giggle at you if you used
   light-years in a professional publication or speech.)  Using our deeper
   knowledge, we can see how much more accurate the Hipparcos satellite would
   be if it were put into Jupiter's orbit, or how accurate its instruments
   need to be to achieve a certain accuracy in distance measurements.  We've
   learned something more general.
  
   Below is the same program as in Sky & Telescope, but more flexible.
   You can enter the exact second of your birth using any of the date formats that Frink
   recognizes. You enter the desired age as "12314 days" or "1 billion
   seconds" or any other duration.  The program uses the  function to calculate the
   target date with leap seconds accounted for.  So you don't
   celebrate on the wrong second within the minute.
  
    birthdate = parseDate[input["Enter your birthdate: "]]
    str = input["Enter desired age: "]
    println["You will be $str old on " + addLeap[birthdate,age]]1969-08-19 04:54 PM MountainYou will be 1 billion seconds old on AD 2001-04-27
     06:40:15.653 PM (Fri) Mountain Daylight Time
   
   Now you want your own star, don't you?  You might take a look at a list of
   the
    brightest stars in the sky
   and look the stars' distances in light-years.  This will give you an idea
   of the bright stars, and give you their Hipparcos catalog numbers.  Using
   the Hipparcos catalog number given in that table, you can look up that star
   from 
   this
    Hipparcos search form, find its Geometrical Parallax (field H11, which
   is probably given in milliarcseconds) and plug that number into the
   equation shown above.  At some point, I may make a Frink Server Page that
   automates this.  But you might learn more just by doing the calculations
   yourself.
  
   Whether you have a kid who is 8.6 years old (for Sirius which is the
   brightest star in the sky and 3141 light-days away,) someone turning 11.4
   (Procyon), turning 16.8 (Altair) or someone turning 65.1 (Aldebaran,) a
   star is a great gift and  might just start a love of astronomy.  I can't
   promise that the moon and the planets will line up for ,
   though.
  
   Note that there is some uncertainty in measuring parallaxes, often several
   percent, and thus the dates are somewhat uncertain, so it's a gift you can
   give  time around the date.  For example, the standard error
   for the parallax of Pollux is 0.87 milliarcseconds (parallax error is field
   H16 in the Hipparcos catalog, specified in milliarcseconds) which leads to
   an actual date that can vary from around January 17, 2003 to August 27,
   2003 -- a range of over 7 months.  Just have fun and celebrate your stars
   when you want!
  
   This one is fun.  I didn't have a grasp of the size difference between the
   Earth and the Moon so I wanted to make a little scale model in my home.  It
   would be best to use spheres of the appropriate sizes, but I don't have
   that many balls.  Instead, I decided to cut circles out of paper.  My
   deciding dimension was the size of the piece of paper I used to cut out the
   pieces.  I could only get a 7-inch diameter circle for the Earth (3.5-inch
   radius), so this defined my scale, which I saved in a variable for use in
   later calculations:
  scale = earthradius / (3.5 inches)
   The standard data file contains information about the dimensions of the
   planets,  being one of those.  Now how big should
   the Moon circle be?
  moonradius / scale -> inches
   Okay, using my rolling ruler, I cut out a circle with radius 0.95 inches
   (diameter 1.9 inches).  There's the Moon.  It's interesting to see the
   difference in size between the Earth and Moon:
  
   Now, to place them properly... how far away should they be at that scale?
  
   Okay, stick the Earth to one wall, and then measure a distance 17.5 feet
   away, and stick the Moon to that.  
   From each vantage point, you can see how big the other actually looks from
   that distance.  Standing by the Earth, you can see how big the Moon looks
   (you've seen the Moon, but it's a smaller angle than you might guess... the
   Moon really doesn't take up much sky, only about half a degree in
   diameter.)  You can verify this by holding a fingernail out at arm's
   length, comparing it to the size of your Moon model, and then going outside
   and doing the same to the Moon, if you can see it.
  
   Now walk over to the Moon and look at the Earth.  It would be pretty big!
   Earth would appear about 3.66 times wider in diameter (in Frink notation,
   , or 13.4 times larger in area (
   pi earthradius^2 / (pi moonradius^2) ).
  
   Just to verify, I wanted to make sure that the visible angles in my model
   match real life.  The visual angle of an object which does not subtend a
   large angle can be expressed as .  The
   angle normally comes out in radians if width and distance are in the same
   units, but this is Frink.  You can get the answer out in degrees, or
   arcminutes if that's where your heart lies:
  1.9 inches / (17.5 feet) -> arcminutes
   Yep, that's just the right number of arcminutes.  From Earth, the Sun and
   the Moon both appear just over half a degree in diameter, or about 32
   arcminutes (an arcminute is 1/60 of a degree).  It all works out.  Note
   that in the standard data file, radians are dimensionless units (a radian
   is defined as "1".)  This is because radians are dimensionless units, but
   you can convert values in radians to other angular units.
  
   By the way, a more accurate angular formula that is valid for large
    small angles subtended by a sphere with a given radius at a
   specified distance is:
  2 arcsin[/( + )] -> degrees
   Note that inverse trigonometric functions (,
   , ) have their output in radians.
   This is easily converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You
   don't see that the output is in radians (if you use the standard data file)
   because radians are dimensionless numbers.  You just gotta be a bit careful
   here, or make the minor change in your units file to make radians a
   fundamental dimension.  (Read the documentation in the units file... the
   units file is otherwise radians-correct.)
   I remember a cool black-and-white movie we saw
   in my Kindergarten class about making a scale model of the solar system.
   It involved a  vertical circular sign representing the Sun
   that somebody had built for the film and a car driving a measured distance
   away to look at it.  (A bit confusing, though.  I remember them saying
   "here we are, 93 million miles away!" and they were still in the same
   park.)  Good stuff, and I'm glad I finally made my own model.  It helps me
   understand how cool the Apollo missions were.  But my enthusiasm is
   tempered by the fact that I'm just now figuring out stuff they tried to
   teach me in Kindergarten.
  
   Now go make your own model.  Pick your own scale to fit your surroundings
   and materials.  It's fun.  In my model, Jupiter would have to
   be a sphere 6.59 feet in diameter, placed about 5.5 miles away right now.
   I'll have to get a bigger place.
  
   Now that you know how to calculate the size in Frink yourself, I've gone
   ahead and built a Frink Server Page that lets you
     In your model, figure and/or plot the following:
  Orbit of the Space Shuttle (about 300 km above the surface of the
    Earth)  Wow.  That's barely up there.
   Orbit of a geosynchronous satellite (42164 km from the 
    of the Earth, or about 22300 miles from the  of the Earth.)
    Stand this far away from the Earth circle... that's how big it would look.
   The sizes of the Sun, other planets, and their moons.
   The speed of light in your model.
  
    "The MCO [Mars Climate Orbiter] MIB [Mishap Investigation Board] has
    determined that the root cause for the loss of the MCO spacecraft was the
    failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file,
    "Small Forces," used in trajectory models.  Specifically, thruster
    performance data in English units instead of metric units was used in the
    software application code titled SM_FORCES (small forces)." --Mars
    Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board, Phase I Report
   This is not to take away from the designers of a wonderfully complex
   spacecraft that can travel to Mars; that's an incredibly difficult problem,
   and I couldn't do it.  However, this is just the type of error that Frink
   was designed to help avoid, and because  make these type of
   errors a lot, I've designed this tool to help me.  Frink tracks units
   through  calculations and makes conversions between them
   transparent.  This is why I'm working toward making Frink a feasible
   solution for calculations of this type.
  
    "I ran across Frink, and as a member of the MCO review board, I
    appreciate your efforts.  Note, however that more than just language
    support is necessary.  First, you'd have to have conventions on data
    I/O -- the misinterpreted data was from a file, not from another
    function in the program.  Also, there was an issue of software reuse
    -- the errant portion of the system had been used before on a previous
    mission, and in that case it was used in a non-critical,
    non-navigational way.  It was not properly reviewed because the team
    did not realize that in MCO it became critical."
   
   The points above are well-taken.  Proper parsing of units can be easily
   achieved in Frink with a simple, appropriate comment in the data file. unittable.frink shows
   how Frink can parse a file containing units of measure.  All that is needed
   is to add a  to the data file that contains the
   units of measure of each data column.  Frink then reads each column with
   the appropriate units of measure and scale, using any units of measure that
   Frink knows about as input, and Frink parses them and works with them
   properly.  See its sample data file.
  
   Frink and its  function could always trivially handle
   the case where each number in a file has its units of measure specified
   with the number, e.g. "".  That's literally
    effort to parse with Frink, and is slightly less compact, but
   that's a very small price to pay, compared to mission failure.
  
   Of course, there's no simple solution for someone completely not reading
   the specification documents, but the fact that a file completely omits any
   units of measure would be a good warning flag to double-check your sources,
   I'm growing to fear and avoid any system that treats every physical
   measurement as an unexplained dimensionless number, as most programming
   languages have for the past few decades.  We can do better.
  
   Keep in mind that the syntax represented in this document 
   change as Frink evolves.  The current parser just makes it easier for me to
   test certain features, and I intentionally refuse to spend a lot of time on
   it at this point.  The internals of the language should be the first
   concern, and the external representation is free to change.  Frink should
   be equally usable whether you want to load and save your data in the
   current mathematical notation, in a (LISP-like) prefix notation, in a (HP
   calculator-like) Reverse-Polish postfix notation, from a
   visually-based GUI, in MathML, TeX, XML, or whatever other
   flavor-of-the-month format the kids are crazy about these days.  The
   internals of the language are intentionally agnostic on this point, as they
   should be in a flexible design.
  
   On the other hand, I always want to keep Frink easy to use and transparent
   for the quick calculations as it is now.  Turning it into a language that
   forces an encumbering programming paradigm is out of the question.
  Alan's Unsolicited Advice: Anytime you're involved with a project
   where you hear people saying "we want to use 'X' technology" before they've
   even thought about representing the problem they're trying to solve, look
   up for the cloud of doom, which floats nigh.  It's like hiring a carpenter,
   who, before he knows what you want to make, insists on using
   mortice-and-tenon joints.
  
   They made me say that.  The included part is the Jakarta ORO regular
   expression library.  I hacked it significantly so that it would compile and
   run on a Java 1.1 platform (so that Frink can be used on small devices
   running PersonalJava 1.1 and run in the JVM in just about any browser out
   there.)
  
   JavaCUP is included under the following licensing terms:  JavaCUP
   license.  Note that the JavaCUP package itself is not included in
   Frink, but is used to generate a parser class.
  
   Frink's lexical analyzer is generated by JFlex.  Since this was generated from
   Frink's own specification, Frink may use the generated code without
   restriction according to JFlex's
   licensing terms.  The JFlex package itself is not included in Frink--it
   is only used to generate a lexer class.
  
   If you've gotten this far, hopefully you've seen something you liked.  If
   you find Frink useful, I'd appreciate if you took a look at some of the
   ways you can donate to Frink's development.
   Thanks!

Airport officials say "some flights" will resume tonight, with full operation beginning Saturday morning. Passengers are being told not to travel to the airport until their airlines give them the green light to do so. Europe's busiest airport was closed on Thursday night by a power outage caused by a fire at an electrical substation. The blaze is being investigated by counter-terror police, but they have said there are no indications of foul play.  The head of British Airways says it will be a major logisitical challenge for airlines to resume their flight schedules, as aircraft and crews may not be in place to fly when Heathrow reopens.

The findings were part of a pair of studies conducted by researchers at the two organizations and have not been peer reviewed. 

San Francisco-based OpenAI sees the new studies as a way to get a better sense of how people interact with, and are affected by, its popular chatbot. "Some of our goals here have really been to empower people to understand what their usage can mean and do this work to inform responsible design," said Sandhini Agarwal, who heads OpenAI's trustworthy AI team and co-authored the research.

In a memo released February 28, the USPTO further restricted access to inter partes review, or IPR—the process Congress created to let the public challenge invalid patents without having to wage million-dollar court battles.If left unchecked, this decision will shield bad patents from scrutiny, embolden patent trolls, and make it even easier for hedge funds and large corporations to weaponize weak patents against small businesses and developers.IPR Exists Because the Patent Office Makes MistakesCongress created IPR in 2012 to fix this problem. IPR allows anyone to challenge a patent’s validity based on prior art, and it’s done before specialized judges at the USPTO, where experts can re-evaluate whether a patent was properly granted. It’s faster, cheaper, and often fairer than fighting it out in federal court.The USPTO is Blocking Patent Challenges—AgainInstead of defending IPR, the USPTO is working to sabotage it. The February 28 memo reinstates a rule that allows for widespread use of “discretionary denials.” That’s when the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) refuses to hear an IPR case for procedural reasons—even if the patent is likely invalid. The February 28 memo reinstates widespread use of the  rule, under which the USPTO often rejected IPR petitions whenever there’s an ongoing district court case about the same patent. This is backwards. If anything, an active lawsuit is proof that a patent’s validity needs to be reviewed—not an excuse to dodge the issue.In 2022, former USPTO Director Kathi Vidal issued a memo making clear that the PTAB should hear patent challenges when “a petition presents compelling evidence of unpatentability,” even if there is parallel court litigation. That 2022 guidance essentially saved the IPR system. Once PTAB judges were told to consider all petitions that showed “compelling evidence,” the procedural denials dropped to almost nothing. This February 28 memo signals that the USPTO will once again use discretionary denials to sharply limit access to IPRDiscretionary Denials Let Patent Trolls Rig the SystemCongress Created IPR to Protect the Public—Not Just Patent Owners]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Announces AITER For ROCm To Help Boost AI Performance</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-AITER-AI-Performance-ROCm</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 18:53:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AMD has been on a software / container / documentation spree recently around ROCm and today are announcing another software addition to the ROCm portfolio: AITER...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>unRAID&apos;s flexibility is why I love it so much (follow up to my failing drive post)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1jgoens/unraids_flexibility_is_why_i_love_it_so_much/</link><author>/u/daggah</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 18:52:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - UnRAID</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks back, one of my 6 TB WD Reds started showing reallocated sectors.

The AI assistant adds a layer of automation and personal guidance to the , providing convenience, efficiency, and enhanced accessibility. With this added feature to the TOMI Wallet, users can now send funds and soon will be able to swap tokens, check prices and token details, monitor balances, and view transaction history via voice commands. The TOMI wallet, with the AI voice assistant, is available to download for  and .\
As AI features increasingly find their way into crypto platforms, products, and services, there is rising interest in utilizing advanced AI technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) within Web3 wallets.\
Progress is being made to integrate AI voice commands into crypto wallets, but the industry hasn’t yet provided Web3 users with an all-encompassing solution. For example, Tether’s  is expected to provide enhanced security features, but it's only in the developmental stage and only caters to Bitcoin holders.\
TOMI’s new AI-powered voice assistant provides hands-free convenience to users, allowing them to engage with digital assets as they go about their daily routines. The AI voice assistant enables faster, mistake-free onboarding with its AI-driven step-by-step direction and contextual understanding, reducing the possibility of sending tokens to the wrong address or selecting the wrong network.\
By managing crypto through TOMI’s intuitive voice interface, users can save time by eliminating the need to navigate multiple screens. The TOMI Wallet’s AI voice assistant is the product of a technical collaboration with , a platform for creating advanced AI agents, who built and integrated the feature.\
The TOMI Wallet’s voice assistant integrates with users’ contacts, offering them the convenience of addressing a contact by name while the AI links them to the right address on the correct network. In the future, TOMI will extend these AI-powered capabilities to manage more aspects of the user experience across TOMI’s broader ecosystem. This could include identity verification, assistance engaging with DeFi protocols, handling NFT transactions, and more.“By embedding AI at the core of the TOMI Wallet, we aim to provide a more unified, intuitive, and smooth user experience,” says Moshe Hogeg, Founder and senior consultant at TOMI. “Soon, our users will be able to not only send crypto through AI voice assistant, but also check market data, interact with DeFi or NFT features, and more. As the first true AI voice assistant to be integrated into a crypto wallet, we aim to redefine the standard for crypto wallets going forward by emphasizing the UX.”TOMI is on a mission to increase digital freedom and build a more democratic and decentralized internet - where users have full control over their data, transactions, and communications.\
Through TOMI, messaging and crypto payments come together, enabling seamless intuitive financial interactions. By making transactions as easy as chatting, tomi is redefining how people connect and transact in the digital age. For more information, visit: :::tip

It comes after another day of airstrikes and ground operations in northern Gaza. Earlier on Thursday, Hamas fired rockets at central Israel. Israel said it had intercepted one of the missiles and that the others caused no injuries.
In Gaza, Palestinians face life-threatening food, fuel, and medical supply shortages, all exacerbated by the Israeli military's resumption of strikes.

Despite the delisting of over 100 Ethereum addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals list, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized continuing concerns about North Korea's digital asset theft operations. 

"We remain deeply concerned about the significant state-sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign aimed at stealing, acquiring, and deploying digital assets for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," Treasury stated. Roman Storm, Tornado Cash co-founder, still faces a July criminal trial for his alleged development role.

            Mathup uses four of MathML’s token elements (identifiers
            , operators , numbers
             and text ). Mathup
            recognizes which of these you mean when you write simple
            expressions.
          <>
  <>1</>
  <>+</>
  <>1</>
</>
<>=</>
<>2</>

            Mathup will also recognize most of the unicode characters you’ll
            write. If a character comes from one of the mathematical operator
            code blocks it will wrap it in an  tag,
            otherwise it will be wrapped in an  tag.
            Additionally  will be wrapped in an
             tag if it obviously a part of a
            differential.
          
            Numbers are usually what you think they are (including unicode
            numerals like Ⅻ or ↋). However if you want to write a number
            in an odd way (like spelling it out, as a hex string, or as a roman
            numeral) you can prepend a string with , (e.g.
            ) or—if your number includes a non alphanumeric
            character—prepend a backticked fence (like in markdown)
            …like so:  or
             to make  a number.
          
            Anything in the , , ,
            , , , ,
            , or  unicode categories is considered
            an operator. Additionally the symbol character or alphanumeric
            string immediately following a backslash  will become
            an operator (). If you need more then one
            symbol character, or more then one word, as a single operator in the
            operator (e.g. ), you can
            fence it following markdown semantics; (e.g.
             or  for
            ).
          The following will also map to the respective operator.
            Anything not a number, operator, or text is considered an
            identifier. This includes latin, greek or arabic letters
            (, , ) or even emoji. Each
            character is considered a separate identifier unless they spell out
            a word found in the tables below or the operator table above.
          
            You can force any sequence of characters to be a single idendifier
            by surrounding them in fences (e.g.  yields
             and
             yields )
          The following will also produce a single identifier:
            You can surround anything in double quotes () and it will get displayed as text. If your text annotation
            contains a quote mark you can surround it with more quotemarks (just
            like with backtick fences). That is
             will give you
            <mtext>"text string"</mtext>.
          
            MathML has an element called . Two or
            more spaces in a row will be translated into that element where it
            makes sense. The width of the space will be:
          
            Where  is the number of subsequent spaces and
             is in units of  which is
            the height of the  character in your font.
          
            In addition  will add 1.65 
            of space to the left of the open parenthesis.
          
            In MathML you enclose fractions in an
             element. In Mathup you simply separate
            the numerator  and the denominator
             with a slash ().
          
            Mathup tries to be smart about what you mean as numerator and
            denominator by looking at the spaces you surround your
            subexpressions with, so
             is  the same thing as
            . Generally a space between the
            subexpression and the slash will apply the entire subexpression,
            while no space only aplies what immediately precedes or follows.
          
            The underscore will impose the following expression as a subscript
            on the preceding expression ( ⇒
            ), the ascii caret will impose a superscript ( ⇒
            ), and the (expression, underscore, caret) / (experssion, caret,
            underscore) sequence (/) will
            impose a sub and superscript on the first expression yielding
            .
          
            Over and underscripts follow a similar pattern exept with
             for underscripts and  for
            overscripts. Also  will put  as an
            underscript, and  and  will
            put  and  as under and
            overscripts.
          
            Unlike fractions, sub/super and under/overscripts are
            right-associative
            and take precedence over fractions. You can strategically place
            whitespace between the sub/sup, or under/over character and the
            surrounding sub expressions just like with fractions, e.g.
             yields
            
            , while  yields
            
            .
          
            We can use parenthesis to group terms together. An any unicode open
            parenthesis (unicode category ) starts a fence, and
            any closing parenthesis (category ) closes it. Note
            that parenthesis don’t have to match, but they do have to come in
            open/close pairs.
          
            You denote an unfenced group with  and
            . You are free to surround the contents of the
            unfenced group with arbitrary operators and the will become the new
            fence. For example if you need an open parenthesis to close a group,
            you can cast them to operators and manually fence the group like so:
          
            Finally, inside groups—along with your normal seperators like
            —you can use the special  as group
            separators. This is especially handy to write
            bra-ket notation:
          
            Matrices are fenced groups with at least one row separator
            () For example
             is a 2×3 matrix and
             is

            . A trailing row break is allowed so you can write a single row
            matrix as . A new-line character can also be
            used as a row separator.
          
            All this does is put the outer brackets as a fence around the table
            inside, so if you want case assignment you can write:
          |x| = { x, if x >= 0 ; -x, otherwise :}
            To write tensors or any other complex indices you can start a group
            with either a hat  or an underscore
             character. The following expression will be your first
            upper or lower index respectively. Every following  or
             will start a new index  for
            . If you want your index on a new column you can add a
             before the  or :
            . You can repeat the previous index position by omitting the
             or  after a comma:
            .
          
            You can also add prescripts by immediately following with an
            expression. 
            or both . Prescripts take priority.
          
            If you want to add sub- or superscripts to your indices, you can
            surround the entire index with parenthesis
             ⇒
            . And if you want to use a comma or a parenthesis as an index, you
            can escape it with a backslash .
          
            MathML has  and
             tags for roots. Mathup similarly provides
             and  (or
             if you prefer) for the squared root of
             and the -th root of  respectively.
          
            The following commands will add accents over or under the following
            expression or add other types of highlighting:
          
            You can change the color or background of a portion of your
            experssion simply by typing that color. Backgrounds are prefixed by
            . If you don’t like that color
            variant, you can overwrite it using the
            --mathup-color-<colorname> or
            --mathup-background-<colorname>CSS custom properties. For example:
          
            If you have an emoji keyboard you can use the colored circle emoji
            (🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣🟤) for color and the colored square emoji
            (🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫) for the background. Black and white circles use the
            medium variant (⚫⚪), and black and white square use the large
            variant (⬛⬜).

Male circumcision is done for religious, cultural or medical reasons.

In Africa, the WHO used male circumcision in the fight against AIDS. But more and more doctors say that the harm done by the procedure outweighs any medical benefits, and that this surgery is performed far too often.
Those affected are increasingly daring to go public, demanding that boys, too, be protected from circumcisions that are not medically necessary. Advocates say their right to physical integrity must be preserved. 
But few take it as far as Florian. He’s sure that his circumcision as a child wasn’t medically necessary. Moreover, his parents were not informed about alternative options. He’s taking his case to court.
The film explores the question of when circumcision actually makes  medical sense, and critically questions the ethics of this millennia-old practice.

Years of rapid glacier retreat mean many are unlikely to survive the 21st century. With glaciers shrinking, this event is less of a celebration, and more of a reckoning. Glaciers and mountain ice caps store about 70% of global freshwater resources. In recent years, glacier ice has receded at a record rate. The loss ranges from 2% in the Antarctic to almost 40% in Central Europe. 

DW caught up with well-traveled photographer Sean Gallup, whose pictures over the past nine years show the stark transformation in the landscape.

Sounds good to me!" Trump wrote in response to the report. has reached out to the Commonwealth for comment via email Friday afternoon.The Commonwealth is primarily comprised of former British colonies or dependencies, born out of the breakup of the British Empire in the mid-20th century. Joining such a group could be seen as a different tact to Trump's other messages on groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations (U.N.), which he has been skeptical of.According to the king is expected to make the offer to make the U.S. the 57th member of the Commonwealth at a time when America's relationship with the European Union (EU) has been strained over Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia.The offer is being seen as a way to bolster the U.S. and United Kingdom's so-called "special relationship", despite America having famously split from British rule in the 1700s. The two countries have frequently worked together on foreign policy in the 20th and 21st centuries.While joining the Commonwealth would largely be symbolic, as the group does not affect governance of its member nations, the move could be used to help avoid the heightened tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump has promised, according to .Trump has shown his support for the British royal family for many years and visited Buckingham Palace as part of a state visit during his first term in the White House. The idea to join the Commonwealth was first floated during that 2017-2021 term.The king invited Trump back to the U.K. for another visit in a letter hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on his trip to the White House. At the meeting, Trump described King Charles III as "a beautiful man."King Charles III in a statement on Commonwealth Day on March 10: "In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship...The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today."While it's not clear if the U.S. would definitely join the Commonwealth, neighbors Canada are part of the group of nations, and at a time of heightened cross-border tensions, being part of the same collective could help ease matters.Update 3/21/25, 12:56 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Think Before You Link: Security Risks of Microchip Implants</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/think-before-you-link-security-risks-of-microchip-implants?source=rss</link><author>Zac Amos</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:36:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ability to control electronics without touching them or paying with a swipe of the hand may seem like sci-fi, but it’s a growing reality. Microchip implants have existed in some form for decades, and technology is now advanced enough to make them practical. Still, this field carries significant security concerns.The Growing Field of Implanted MicrochipsVeterinarians have implanted radiofrequency identification chips in pets since the 1990s. Human microchips  for medical use, though the technology did not catch on at the time.\
Fast-forward to today, and several leading tech companies and startups are researching microchip implants. Most famously, Elon Musk’s Neuralink has begun trials for brain-computer interfaces, which let users control electronic devices with their thoughts. Simpler chips that use RFID or near-field communication to store information or manage electronic payments are already available for commercial use.\
These chips can stand in for debit cards, give doctors access to vital medical information or work as keycards to access digital locks. Though they may not necessarily be widespread yet, they’re becoming increasingly prevalent.Cybersecurity Risks of Microchip ImplantsWhile chip implants can be highly convenient, they also open the door to unique cybersecurity risks. People should consider these potential dangers before proceeding with the technology.Contactless payments are one of the most practical ways to use an implanted microchip. However, this application means users are theoretically always vulnerable to skimming. Cybercriminals could intercept financial information if they get close enough to the implant, and because it’s essentially part of the user’s body, physical protections are minimal.\
Thankfully, while skimming has garnered much attention from RFID-blocking wallets, it’s not a common threat. NFC is even more secure, as it can  of the chip, making it difficult for criminals to get close enough. Still, the possibility may worry some consumers.A more concerning threat is the risk of cybercriminals installing malware onto an implanted chip. Researchers have proved that , even when the chip does not connect to an actively running device. Attackers may still need to get close to do so, but the damage might go far beyond skimming card details.\
Malware could cause a chip to malfunction. Depending on what people use their microchips for, that could leave them locked out of rooms or unable to access some electronics. The malware could also spread to anything that connects to the implant, including smart home devices or users’ phones.Finally, storing sensitive data in a wirelessly accessible chip in people’s bodies raises privacy questions, especially when it comes to BCIs. A BCI could theoretically , even including users’ thoughts if technology advances enough.\
A breach at a business storing its customers’ brainwaves could give criminals access to a massive amount of highly sensitive information. Even outside such an event, targeted advertising based on brain data may feel like a privacy violation. The possibility of government bodies accessing this information further complicates the ethical implications.Given these risks, implanted chips should implement a few extra security measures to protect their users. More best practices will emerge as the technology develops, but there are still a few must-have options to include.The companies offering microchip implants must adhere to zero-trust policies. Government agencies , and private businesses would be wise to adopt the same standards.\
Zero-trust architecture treats every transaction as a possible breach, verifying all data transmissions before allowing them. It also restricts access permissions as much as possible. That level of attention and responsiveness is crucial for anything involving as much sensitive information and potential complications as a chip in users’ bodies.Implementing stronger defenses for accessing the microchip and its connected services is also critical. Even a PIN is better than nothing. Hackers can , but they would still have to get within centimeters of an implanted NFC chip to do so.\
Setting and changing a PIN and managing the information and permissions of an implanted chip should require more robust protections. Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication are essential. Services should also restrict access attempts to stop unauthorized users from changing what it takes to get into an implant-based system.Finally, microchip implants will be more secure when they do less. While some organizations may not want to sacrifice functionality, limiting what a chip can do minimizes the ways an attacker can take advantage of it. Restricting long-range communications is vital for protection.\
The most robust defense implanted chips have today is that they only work within a few centimeters. A microchip with remote accessibility or Wi-Fi functionality suddenly becomes vulnerable to a much wider range of attacks and potential entry points. Maintaining a relative air gap by relying on NFC or RFID and restricting the kinds of data a chip can access and transmit make them far safer.Microchip Implants Are Exciting But Potentially RiskyDespite being around since the ‘90s, implanted microchip technology is still in its infancy. As this field grows and develops, its possibilities will expand, but so might its potential dangers.\
Cybersecurity considerations must come before expanded functionality and adoption. When these systems follow a security-by-design approach, people can use them confidently and safely. Failing to consider such risks in design and implementation could lead to catastrophic consequences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How much trust do you put into the containers you run?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jgl3zo/how_much_trust_do_you_put_into_the_containers_you/</link><author>/u/SnooDoughnuts9361</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:36:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Self Hosted</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am considering deploying a stack and uploading my personal data to it, but it has me thinking on the security part of it.

As someone who has worked primarily with Typescript over the last few years, learning Golang was challenging as much as it was stimulating.Recap: What are interfaces?Interfaces ensure consistent behavior without focusing on implementation details.Interfaces in TypeScript are structuralTypeScript is a  type system, one way it achieves this is using interfaces.\
They allow you to define the structure of objects you expect to handle within your code. Let’s take a common example of a  object.interface Person {
    name: string
    talk(text: string): void
    walk(to: string): string
}

const john: Person = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    talk: function (text: string): void {
        console.log('Speaking: ', text)
    },
    walk: function (to: string): string {
        return `${this.name} is at ${to}`
    },
}
Go’s interfaces are behavioralGo uses , meaning a struct matches an interface as long as it has matching method signatures.In Go, there is , all structs implicitly implement interfaces. The compiler deduces this during build time.// interface to be implemented by the Person struct
type PersonLike interface {
 Walk(string) string
 Talk(string)
}

// a `Person` struct
type Person struct {
 Name string
}

// Talk implements PersonBehavior.
func (p Person) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

// Walk implements PersonBehavior.
func (p Person) Walk(text string) string {
 return p.Name + "is at " + text
}

func main() {
 // declare `john` of PersonLike type
 var john PersonLike
 // assign an instance of the Person
 john = Person{}

 // invoke `.Walk` on the object
 println(john.Walk("home"))
}
In the above example, a struct is first created and then the methods are implemented on it.The compiler automatically detects the implementation of the interface by the  struct. Any struct having the method signature will satisfy the interface type\
The example below demonstrates how the same object instance can satisfy multiple interfaces, each containing a subset of its method signatures.package main

// interface to be implemented by the Person struct
type PersonLike interface {
 Walk(string) string
 Talk(string)
}

// interface that only has `Walk`
type Walker interface {
 Walk(string) string
}

// interface that only has `Talk`
type Talker interface {
 Talk(string)
}

// a `Person` struct
type Person struct {
 Name string
}

func (p Person) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

func (p Person) Walk(text string) string {
 return p.Name + "is at " + text
}

func main() {
 // declare `john` of PersonLike type
 var john PersonLike
 // assign an instance of the Person
 john = Person{}

 var johnWalker Walker
 // assign to object to `Walker` type
 johnWalker = john
 // invoke `.Walk`
 johnWalker.Walk("home")
 // Error below: johnWalker.Talk is undefined (Walker does not have Talk method)
 johnWalker.Talk("I am home")

 var johnTalker Talker
 johnTalker = john
 johnTalker.Talk("How do I get home?")

 // invoke `.Walk` on the object
 println(john.Walk("home")) // "John is at home"
 println(john.(Person).Name) // John
}
 allows you to create interfaces that have no methods declared i.e., it can hold a value of any type without any restrictions.The  equivalent would be the  typeconst empty: unknown = {}
Empty interfaces come in handy when the programmer knows the type but it is unknown to the type system. A common example would be de-serializing unknown types.func parse(val interface{}) (string, error) {
 // Gets the type of `value`
 switch value := val.(type) {
 case string:
  return string(value), nil
 default:
  return "", fmt.Errorf("unsupported data %#v", value)
 }
}
Methods in Go can have either Pointer receivers or value receivers. Depending on what is used the compiler treats them differently while matching interfaces.The following code won’t be compiled because of the error in line 39.package main

// interface that only has `Talk`
type Talker interface {
 Talk(string)
}

// a `PersonPtr` struct that has a pointer receiver for `Talk`
type PersonPtr struct {
 Name string
}

// Add implements PersonBehavior.
func (p *PersonPtr) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

// a `Person` struct that has a value receiver for `Talk`
type Person struct {
 Name string
}

// Add implements PersonBehavior.
func (p Person) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

func main() {
 // assign an instance of the Person
 var john Talker

 johnny := PersonPtr{}
 johnny.Talk("I can talk")

 // Error: PersonPtr does not implement Talker (method Talk has pointer receiver)
 john = johnny

This can however be fixed by replacing the assignment that  with:Since  is implemented only for , passing a pointer () to , ensuring it satisfies the interface.Go interfaces enable implicit implementation, reducing boilerplate and improving flexibility. allows structs to satisfy interfaces automatically if method signatures match.Multiple interface satisfaction lets a struct conform to different behaviors dynamically. provide a way to handle unknown types, useful for generics.Pointer vs. value receivers impact interface satisfaction - choosing the right one is key.Hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. \n If you think this will be of help to someone?

This set the stage for the catastrophic LA fires in January 2025. Two years of heavy rainfall spurred rapid vegetation growth, only for eight months of extreme drought to transform that vegetation into a tinderbox. When high winds swept through, all it took was a spark for LA to ignite.

But Mexico has fallen behind in its water payments due to drought conditions in the arid north of the country.US farmers and lawmakers complain that the neighboring country has waited until the end of each cycle in the past and has come up short in the latest period.A year ago the last sugar mill in southern Texas shut down, blaming a lack of water deliveries from Mexico.After 18 months of negotiations, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement in November, days after Trump’s election, to improve deliveries.Hailed then by the Biden administration, the understanding calls for Mexico to work with the United States to deliver water in a more timely way, including earlier in each five-year cycle.Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Thursday before the state department announcement that the water issue was “being dealt with” through the two countries’ boundary and water commission.“There’s been less water. That’s part of the problem,” she told reporters.Tijuana, a sprawling city on the border with the US state of California that has become a hub for manufacturing, depends on the Colorado River for about 90% of its water and has suffered waste from creaky infrastructure.The Colorado River, also a major water source for Los Angeles and Las Vegas, has seen its water levels shrink due to drought and heavy agricultural consumption in the south-western United States, with around half of its water going to raise beef and dairy cattle.In southern Texas, farmers have voiced fear for the future of cotton, citrus and other farming products without more regular water deliveries from across the border in Mexico.Brooke Rollins, the US agriculture secretary, on Wednesday announced $280m in relief funds for Rio Grande valley farmers.“Texas farmers are in crisis because of Mexico’s noncompliance,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on X, praising the state department’s water decision.“I will work with the Trump administration to pressure Mexico into complying and to get water to Texas farmers.”The water dispute comes as Trump takes a tough approach to Latin American countries, especially on migration.Trump on returning to office has vowed to end arrivals of undocumented migrants, who largely come from Central America and Venezuela but transit through Mexico.Trump deployed troops to the border and announced painful tariffs on Mexico, although he has since put them on hold until 2 April.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IronRDP: a Rust implementation of Microsoft&apos;s RDP protocol</title><link>https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP</link><author>mikece</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:35:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apparently I get a helper while cleaning the rack</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1jgjlf5/apparently_i_get_a_helper_while_cleaning_the_rack/</link><author>/u/nebbywan</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:32:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mindset Shift You Need When Transitioning From Employee to Leadership</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmYD9gcIQK4</link><author>That Career Coach - Kendall Berg</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WmYD9gcIQK4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:30:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ1a2a26kcwJiomdJR8N0g">Podcast - Career Coach</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to transition from employee to leader, you need to shift your mindset.

My primary uses will be media storage, Plex, "*arr" apps and maybe Home Assistant.Component choice is limited where I live (Iceland), but I have come up with what I think is a decent spec that will allow for expansions later and would appreciate any feedback/advice anyone may have.The Node 304 is the only ITX/MATX small-ish case available here with more than 4 3.5" bays.I went for the 12400 as I wanted an Intel iGPU for transcodes (rarely needed, but nice to have) and the 14400 costs more.The motherboard is overkill, but it's the only ITX board available here that has 2.5GBE built in and allows PCI bifurcation, which seems like a good idea given the single PCI slot (thinking I may want/need to add more M.2/SATA later, or maybe a 10GB NIC). Also, it has both NVMe slots on the front side (I was worried about overheating with one on the back of the board in the Node 304).RAM/Cooler are just the cheapest available that will do the job (and RAM is on the QVL for the motherboard).PSU - cheapest modular PSU available here that has at least 6 SATA connections. Also, the SFX form factor will allow a little more space in the case.My plan (from my initial reading - will try to learn more before I actually set it up) is to use the WD Blue NVMe drives mirrored as a cache for appdata/docker/VMs/transfer cache (is it OK to do all of this from one pool or would I be better splitting them and using them differently?).Regarding the drives, the WD Red Plus 12TB (WD120EFBX) are actually quite expensive here but I want to try to minimise noise. I figure I can start with 3 (single parity drive) and then add more data drives as needed and another parity drive at some point.I could get Ironwolf Pro 16TB (ST16000NE000) or Toshiba MG08 16TB (MG08ACA16TE) for the same as the 12TB Red Plus or could get Ironwolf 12TB (ST12000VN0008) or MG07 14TB (MG07ACA14TE) for less.My understanding is that all of these options are louder (or have a more annoying noise) than the Red Plus though?Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions/thoughts!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft is exploring a way to credit contributors to AI training data</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/microsoft-is-exploring-a-way-to-credit-contributors-to-ai-training-data/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:15:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is launching a research project to estimate the influence of specific training examples on the text, images, and other types of media that generative AI models create.

Earlier, the Israeli government had approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to remove the domestic intelligence head from his post. The court's recent temporary freeze enables petitions against Bar's dismissal. Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in Bar long ago, while Bar himself had previously hinted he might resign after taking responsibility for intelligence failures over the October 7 Hamas terror attacks.

This blockchain-based technology has also come to the forefront thanks to projects such as BAYCs whose images have been purchased by celebrities and traded at very high prices as reported by several media. In this paper, we analyzed the phenomenon of NFTs, focusing on the class related to PFPs. We chose 18 projects based on our knowledge in the field and based on their importance in terms of volumes traded, users, and social activity. It was illustrated through analysis of social activity how the concept of social community is essential to ensure liquidity and value of PFP projects, i.e., used as social icons. The centrality and influence of the community related to BAYCs was demonstrated, that despite being second to CryptoPunks in terms of volumes traded, social activity is much higher and central to every other project in the industry. This work aimed to lay the groundwork for more in-depth future studies on understanding whether patterns and causality conditions may exist between elements such as the number of tweets, average price of a collection, Twitter users, and Ethereum wallet.[1] Oluwaseun Ajao, Jun Hong, and Weiru Liu. 2015.

The legal action follows an investigation that uncovered and eliminated more than 10,000 illegitimate listings. 

The investigation began after a Texas business reported an unlicensed locksmith impersonating them on the platform. Google discovered the scams primarily targeted "duress verticals" -- services needed in urgent situations like locksmiths and towing companies. "Once we're alerted to the actual fraud, we take extreme efforts to identify similar fraudulent listings," said Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel. 

The scammers used tactics including bait-and-switch schemes and intercepting calls to legitimate businesses through "lead generation services." They also sold fraudulent positive reviews to suppress negative feedback.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Intel/AMD GPU Features, Apple Touch Bar Drivers &amp; Other Likely Changes For Linux 6.15</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-Likely-Features</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:52:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With the Linux 6.14 stable kernel likely debuting on Sunday, the Linux 6.15 merge window will then open for kicking off the next development cycle.

WSJ explains why economists believe this strategy will end up hurting U.S. consumers.

For the past 6 months I've been working on an open source python library that implements differentiable geometric optics in PyTorch. It's very experimental still, but eventually the goal is to use it to design optical systems with a state of the art optimization framework and a beautiful code based API. Think OpenSCAD, but for optical systems.Not only is PyTorch's autograd an amazing general purpose optimizer, but torch.nn (the neural network building blocks) can be used pretty much out of the box to model an optical system. This is because there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in a so-called sequential optical system. So the magic is that we can stack lenses as if we were stacking Conv2D and ReLu layers and everything works out. Instead of Conv2D you have ray-surface collision detection, instead of ReLu you have the law of refraction. Designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network.You should be able to `pip install torchlensmaker` to try it out, but I just set it up so let me know if there's any trouble.I was part of the Winter 1'24 batch at the Recurse Center (https://www.recurse.com/) working on this project pretty much full time. I'm happy to talk about that experience too!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stop wasting time putting silly numbers at the beginning of your folders to sort them - manual order them with simple drag and drop instead.

Prince William asked whether there was still a stigma when it comes to talking about mental health problems in the armed forces. "It's going in the right direction," welfare officer Amy-Jane Hale replied.While touring the facilities, the prince managed to try his hand at pool and table football. That quickly became a game between his team Aston Villa and a supporter of their rivals Birmingham City.On Thursday, hundreds of local Estonians waited in the cold to meet the prince in Tallinn, lining the railings to shake his hand or to take a selfie. He was warmly welcomed to this small, tech-savvy country, which increasingly relies upon its allies.Estonia has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, sharing a border with Russia and having been under Soviet rule in the past. All around the capital there are Ukrainian flags flying alongside the Estonian blue, black and white tricolour.Many Ukrainian families have taken refuge in Estonia. During a visit to a school in Tallinn for Ukrainian child refugees, Prince William praised Ukraine's strength. "The Ukrainian resilience is everywhere," Prince William told the students.

ABSTRACT
Why are companies quietly using languages like Elm, OCaml, and Haskell?

No development department gets in trouble for going with industry standard languages, but that also means there is sometimes space to gain a considerable advantage over your competetion through language selection.

Drawing from notable success stories like Jane Street, Standard Chartered, Corvus, and Vendr, we will evaluate typed functional languages from a business perspective: What are the concrete business advantages gained by the companies using typed functional languages? When are these advantages likely (and unlikely) to translate to other businesses? And how can a business responsibly evaluate if the same advantages are available in their particular case? [...]

The hashtags - that are words preceded by the # symbol such as #NFT - are in fact the most common method used by Twitter users to create\
specific groups and streams of communication. We identified 60,060 different hashtags and thus constructed a weighted undirected graph where: each node represents a hashtag and each connection between two nodes represents the presence of a tweet in which both corresponding hashtags were used. As the weight of each node was assigned the number of tweets in which the corresponding hashtag was present, and as the weights of each connection the number of tweets having the two corresponding hashtags in common. Figure 6a illustrates in descending order which are the 20 most used hashtags: NFT, cryptopunks, and BAYC are the most significant ones. Beyond the 20th, namely art, the weights are much lower. Overall, the properties of the graph thus formed are shown in Table 3a: the graph consists of 762,950 connections, with an average weight of about 29,634 common tweets. The average clustering coefficient and the relatively significant number of connected components (that is 439) suggest the presence of highly specialized communities within this content graph. However, edge density is extremely low in this case, being hashtags mainly connected with some central hashtags (see below). Most likely for this reason, modularity has a low value. While\
Figure 6b illustrates in descending order which are the 20 hashtags with highest pagerank. Again, the values beyond the 20-th (famorie, related to the CryptoMories) the weight is much lower. Figure 4b illustrates the graph taking into account only these 20 hashtags, where the size of the nodes is proportional to the pagerank: again, as can be observed, the hashtags NFT, cryptopunks and BAYC are the most in"uential. We also performed a commonality analysis for the hashtags: this was summarized in Table 3c. As can be observed, the NFT hashtag is the one that is most common to all. The hashtags nftart, nftartist, and nftcollection are neither close to cryptopunks nor BAYC: this indicates how for more generic topics, and not only related to PFP, the discourses are less polarized on cryptopunks and BAYC.Figure 7 shows trends in volume, average price, tweets, and users (wallets and Twitter accounts) for a number of very different projects from the date of creation until April 14, 2022. BAYC, CryptoHodlers, Mekaverse, and mfers were considered. As can be seen, the BAYC built up a continuous engagement on Twitter where within a year the number of unique users talking about them grew exponentially, as did the average price, which went from 0.08ETH to more than 100ETH in less than a year. There are projects, such as CryptoHodlers, on the other hand, where although the creators try to build an ecosystem around their project by distributing comics or developing a new reserved NFT, the community has not grown, impacting the average price and liquidity (in terms of daily trades) of this project. Mekaverse and mfers, summarize these concepts: for the former we see how a high number of tweets in the early stages of the project resulted in an initial high exchange value where the figurines traded for a minimum price of 8ETH, then went to 10 times less as the number of tweets dropped. For the latter, on the other hand, we see that engagement in terms of daily tweets coincides with an increase in average price, and this occurs gradually and constantly after their release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AlexNet Source Code Is Now Open Source</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/alexnet-source-code</link><author>Hansen Hsu</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81ODM2NzgzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTUyOTc1Nn0.OQfBJOPQ7LvjN2mFru5XJOFO88BJTwYUvGspfN81dtA/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First released in 2012, AlexNet sparked a revolution in AI and computer vision]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Sees Last Minute Fix For A Two Year Old Regression Causing A 30% Performance Drop</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-Sched-2-Year-Regress</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Submitted today ahead of the Linux 6.14 stable release expected Sunday is a lone scheduler fix for the kernel.

On his first day back in office, Trump issued an order stating that the government would recognize only two sexes: male and female.A new section has been added under Denmark's visa rules for entry into the United States. It states that when applying for a U.S. visa, there are only two gender options available, male or female.If your passport has the gender designation X, or if you have changed your gender, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises contacting the American embassy before traveling for guidance on how to proceed.The change was made after LGBT+ Denmark contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting an update to the travel advice, per RadioIIII.Meanwhile in Finland, the advisory notes that if the gender on an applicant's passport differs from the gender confirmed at birth, U.S. authorities may deny entry. It's recommended to check the entry requirements with U.S. authorities in advance.Additionally, Finnish passports do not include an "X" gender marker. If a dual citizen holds a passport with an "X" marker, it's advisable to verify entry conditions with U.S. authorities beforehand, according to the new guidance.It comes after Trump also signed an executive order outlining steps to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, a policy currently facing legal challenges. A Pentagon memo issued in late February directs military branches to identify and discharge transgender service members within 30 days.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth later issued a memo stating that transgender individuals would no longer be allowed to enlist in the military while emphasizing that service members with gender dysphoria who are already serving would be "treated with dignity and respect."Federal Judge Ana Reyes blocked Trump's executive order prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military.Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has updated its travel guidance for British citizens planning to visit the country, warning of potential arrest or detention if travelers fail to comply with entry requirements.Head of secretariat LGBT+ Denmark Susanne Branner Jespersen told RADIO IIII: "We are worried that people will be stopped at the airport and denied entry, or that they will be exposed to something that is transgressive and unpleasant at the airport, says Susanne Branner Jespersen."At LGBT+ Denmark, however, they want a very clear answer to what to expect if you as a transgender person want to apply for entry to the United States. Therefore, they will contact the American embassy directly."It is expected that more European nations will update travel guidance as President Trump reshapes America's domestic and foreign policy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>European Central Bank Chief Economist Warns of US Financial Dominance</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/03/21/0658224/european-central-bank-chief-economist-warns-of-us-financial-dominance?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane warned that Europe must develop a digital euro to counter growing American influence over the continent's financial system [alternative source] amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Lane specifically cited Europe's "current dependence on US payment-card providers Visa and Mastercard, as well as technology companies including PayPal, Apple and Google" as a vulnerability requiring urgent action. 

His comments come as President Donald Trump's administration promotes dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide as part of a broader cryptocurrency strategy, alarming European officials. ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau recently cautioned that "the US risks bringing about the next financial emergency through its support of cryptocurrencies."

The milestone demonstrates growing market demand for AI that can operate autonomously without human oversight. Processing two billion tokens daily is equivalent to approximately half of Wikipedia's content, generating 7.9 million images, or processing over 2,100 hours of video content per day."This growth confirms we're addressing the critical barrier to AI's transformative potential," said Karan Sirdesai, Co-founder and CEO of Mira. "Today's AI remains constrained by the need for human verification—we're removing that bottleneck to enable truly autonomous intelligence capable of operating independently in high-stakes scenarios."Enabling the Shift from 'Baby AI' to Autonomous IntelligenceCurrent AI systems excel at generating content and solving problems, but their probabilistic nature makes them fundamentally unreliable. This creates a paradox: the more powerful AI becomes, the more human hours are required to verify its output, severely limiting AI's potential.\
Mira is addressing this challenge through decentralized verification that enables AI systems to operate autonomously in consequential domains. By transforming the verification process from a human bottleneck to a scalable, trustless system, Mira is paving the way for AI's next evolutionary leap.Applications Demonstrating the VisionThis vision is coming to life through several applications built on Mira's verification infrastructure:Klok — A multi-LLM chat application providing access to leading AI models including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.3 70B Instruct within a unified interface. Klok treats each AI model as a trustless independent node, with verification features set to roll out in coming weeks.WikiSentry — An AI agent that autonomously fact-checks Wikipedia articles against verified sources, identifying hallucinations, biases, and misinformation—a task previously requiring extensive human oversight.Astro — A guidance platform helping users navigate life's important decisions through personalized, AI-powered insights that leverage verified information for reliable advice.Amor — A supportive AI companion offering conversation and emotional connection for those seeking meaningful interaction, with verification ensuring consistent and trustworthy responses.Public Testnet Enables Developer InnovationMira has today launched its Public Testnet, enabling developers, enterprises, and users to explore its blockchain-based verification network at , where all AI inferences are recorded as transparent, verifiable events.

Working on apps serving millions of users taught me it’s about way more people, who have to be included when building scalable Angular apps.\n One of the main goals of us, frontend software engineers, is to make sure the apps we build are accessible to as many people as possible. There are many ways to ensure that, for example having great designs, but also being really focused on how the app works. Testing it in multiple browsers, on multiple resolution, screen orientations and so on.\
But the term “accessibility” isn’t really about it, but, as Wikipedia says:Web accessibility, or eAccessibility,[1] is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, more users have equal access to information and functionality. ()\
What we can recognize as the user oriented needs for web accessibility can be grouped into multiple categories:cognitive and intellectual\
And we tend to think these issues only affect some minor group. So we apply WCAG rules not always as part of the general process. It’s rather something that is either taken care of to some extend during the whole design and development process, or at some point as a separate task.\
By the way, my name is Tom Smykowski, I’m an expert in building scalable, enterprise Angular applications and in this series I’ll be teaching you how to do it!\
Approaches to accessibility depend on many factors, including legal requirements. But from the people perspective, what can be surprising, that actually accessibility isn’t about a narrow group of people.\
Just to five some examples. Around 8% of men have what is called congenital red–green color blindness. It means that they can’t to various extend to differentiate some pairs of colors:\
It seems to not affect UI development, until you have a list of alerts and notifications. When alert and notification icons are similar and small, people won’t be able to recognize what is what leading to problems or to considerable inconvenience that will drive them away from your app.\
And we’re not talking about some minor group. It’s 8% of men. An inaccessible app in that matter can be a blocker for 8% of potential users. If someone came and said, he can increase adoption by around 8%, he would be called a charlatan, but here accessibility itself can do it without any impact on business and marketing processes if initially the app isn’t accessible in that matter.\
Another set of disorders that affects if people can use apps is motor difficulties. For example essential tremor. It’s a motor neurological disorder causing involuntary, rhythmic shaking of hands that affects almost 1% of global population.\
People with essential tremor, but also other motor disorders find many difficulties in life, also in the area of digital life where apps that should help them, not always do it. Too small buttons, located too close to each other are only a tip of an iceberg of thigs that can lock out people with disabilities from these areas from your application.\
Moving fast forward to intellectual and cognitive conditions, just for selective example, we have around 1% of people affected by intellectual disabilities, and separately and not connected, 10% of global population affected by autism spectrum.\
Complex and overloaded interfaces, ambiguous icons, wording, non consistent navigation, jargon or complex language, no clear feedback, poor readability are just some of elements that affect negatively people with intellectual and cognitive conditions.\
Again, a quite large proportion of people globally that will find it hard to use your app if it’s not accessible. What’s interesting, especially for MVP driven startups this is essential, because the app shouldn’t only do the one thing that people want, it should also allow them to do it.\
As you can see, accessibility isn’t only for few people, it’s for a quite large proportion of all people. Around one of three people has a condition that makes using apps difficult.\
Inaccessible app isn’t just an inconvenience and in highly competitive market it’s a deal-breaker. No one will use an app if they can go to competition that allows them to do just what they need to do despite their various conditions.\
In terms of scalable Angular apps, it means we should focus on accessibility and treat it as essential process of design and development. I’d say even more, we should sacrifice other design goals if they lower accessibility, because there’s no sense in building pretty things that people can’t use.\
The goal of architecting scalable Angular apps is to build ones that are widely used, and prepared for global usage horizontally and vertically. In the process terms a good design system and component library are places where accessibility can be provided organisation-wide.\
But it also requires training and including accessibility in all processes affecting user interface, from requirement phase, through design to implementation and maintained, because everyone involved in these processes has to be aligned to reach for the same goal.\
That way we don’t build accessibility debt. Compared to technical debt, accessibility debt affects our users every day. Way more people than we think.\
I’ve prepared a free checklist how to make your Angular app scalable and ready for enterprise demand. If you’re interested, you can get this checklist for .\

As the first analysis, we analysed the growth that occurred on this ecosystem in terms of number of transactions and tweets, and in terms of number of unique Twitter users and Ethereum wallets who participated in the various project communities. The data reported in Table 2, and summarized in Figure 2, shows how in one year the PFP interest on Twitter went from 50 daily tweets in the beginning of January 2021 to more than 50,000 daily tweets in mid April 2022 by considering only the 18 selected projects. In the same period the number of daily unique Twitter users passed from 50 to more than 20,000 with a peak of 60,000, onboarding during the whole period more than 1 million unique active users. Interestingly, from Figure 2 (c) and (d) both the new and cumulative Twitter users and Ethereum wallets follow the same trend: this means that owning one of these NFTs implies therefore also participating in social activity on Twitter.In order to identify the interactions and connections that were formed across the communities of each project, we performed as a first analysis one that aimed to identify common Twitter users and Etehereum wallets. For each collection we defined: (i) the list of Twitter users who have posted at least one tweet attributable to a collection (i.e., mentioning the official account, or using one of the hashtags defined in Table 1), (ii) the list of Ethereum wallets that have purchased at least one of the tokens in the collection. Figure 3a depicts a matrix showing for each cell (8, 9) the number of common Twitter users between the project shown in the i-row and the one shown in the j-column. The matrix can be read row by row: for each row i, the total number of users is given by the cell on the diagonal (i,i), the cells on the i-th row are then normalized to this. Similarly, it can be read column by column. The same considerations can be made when considering the Ethereum wallets that are illustrated in Figure 3b. From both of these figures we can see that the projects that dominate in terms of Twitter users and Ethereum wallets are the CryptoPunks, BAYC, Cool Cats, Gutter Cat, World of Women, and Doodles. A second type of analysis that we performed was to analyze the tweets in common between pairs of projects and represent this information as an undirected weighted graph. The graph was constructed by defining a node for each project and defining a weighted arc between projects where the weight. As the weight of each node was assigned the number of tweets and as the weight of each arc the number of common tweets\
(i.e., counting the number of tweets that concern the two projects at the same time). The resulting graph is shown in Figure 4a, while the structural statistics of the graph are summarized in Table 3a. The graph consists of 18 nodes (the number of projects), and 153 arcs in a single connected component. All the nodes are connected with the remaining 17 (see average degree, transitivity and edge density): this indicates how the social community, although polarized toward a few projects, is highly connected (i.e. average clustering equal to 1). For this reason, modularity is equal to 0, i.e. having a single cluster there is no di#erence among edges within groups and edges expected on the basis of chance [11]. We successively performed a pagerank analysis to identify which nodes were the most in"uential: results are reported in Figure 5b and we can see that the most in"uential ones are BAYC, CryptoPunks, Cool Cats, Gutter Cat, World of Women, and Doodles. These are the same ones that were identi!ed in the previous analysis and, as can also be seen from Figure 6a, also the ones with the highest number of associated tweets. For each project we then tried to identify commonality with the others by going to identify the heaviest graph arcs. In other words, for each project we identi!ed the three most related by going for the ones with the most tweets in common. Table 3b summarizes these results: you can see that the BAYC are most often present and most connected with the other projects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Recruiters, We Need to Rethink Code Tests in Technical Hiring</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/recruiters-we-need-to-rethink-code-tests-in-technical-hiring?source=rss</link><author>Edward Aslin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:58:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Code tests filter for a specific type of candidate; those with encyclopedic knowledge of syntax, algorithms, and computer science theory…or just those who are good at completing logic puzzles in time-critical environments.\
Examined critically, preliminary code tests and whiteboard coding rarely assess real-world problem-solving, collaboration and system integration. Yet, they can dictate who gets hired.\
The use case, for the kind of programmer that these tests identify, has been shrinking for some time now. The skills that define 'great' programmers, today, extend far beyond rote memorisation. Being able to apply context, bringing unique perspectives, understanding a bigger picture, and integrating components effectively are now, more than ever, far more valuable than simply grinding out code.The rising popularity of AI interview assistantsThe emergence of AI interview assistants that can help you solve complex coding problems in real time underscore this issue nicely. See LeetCode Wizard, ParakeetAI and Ultracode.\
These tools can help candidates solve complex coding problems in real time, effectively automating the skill set that coding interviews historically prize, sometimes with near-perfect results.\
If AI can pass these tests; then what exactly are we evaluating in human candidates?The ability to solve isolated code problems is becoming a cheap trick\
In an era where AI can handle syntax and debugging, the value of a developer increasingly lies in the ability to think critically, adapt and apply technology in meaningful ways.Why code tests are likely exclusionaryIn recent history, tech has been exclusionary, in both perception and practise.\
From perception of computers, to education and then surviving the culture. The field has long been built around a narrow definition of who belongs.\
We also know, in the UK, 1 in 7 are considered neurodiverse. Neurodiversity is a wide spectrum including dyslexia, ADHD & Autism, and at its core is a difference in how the brain thinks. Assessing many neurodivergents via code test alone, would be to do them a great injustice. Many will often struggle with time-constrained, high-pressure coding tests, even if they possess strong real-world programming skills.\
This is all backed up by the fact, that anonymous code tests do not remove bias. While theoretically, AI marking of code tests could be tweaked to eliminate bias, this would do nothing to address the systematic barriers that dictate who excels at this type of test in the first place.How Cheating with AI Could Shift The ParadigmInterestingly, these new AI assistants could level the playing field.\
Candidates who might have been previously excluded for failing an isolated code test may now have a better shot. Either because;A) they use these tools to cheatB) those applying using these tests to assess candidates may realise their futility\
While we are all taught cheating is not a good thing, do you expect people who are disproportionately discriminated against in the hiring process not to use these tools to their advantage? Especially when they have spent any length of time in industry, they will witness the kind of behaviour often required to rise to the top of the tree. And know that cheating in a code test doesn't come even close to that in terms of morality.None of this, means that understanding code is becoming obsolete. Understanding algorithms, data structures, complex code and system architecture will remain crucial for making informed decisions. But people can have these abilities, and still fail a code test. A classic example being Max Howell, creator of the beloved dev tool homebrew. Who in 2015 tweeted…Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f* off\
An experienced hiring manager, with relevant technical experience, should be able to gauge somebody's ability from less formal interviews, and walk through of similar code the candidate has written, and products that they have worked upon.\
Further steps to assess a candidate could includeTake home coding projects; giving the candidate a chance to complete the test in a safe environmentPair programming interviews; assessing collaboration and communicationSystem design interviews; testing the ability to plan and scale architecture theoretically\
Although in all of these cases, you would still need to be mindful about how each could potentially discriminate against different subsets of the population.While there cannot be an over reliance on AI, we are already seeing that encyclopedic knowledge is no longer the primary currency. Instead, the ability to leverage AI, connect ideas and solve problems in a nuanced, meaningful way is taking centre stage. Code tests alone will not help you assess this.\
As large language models continue to advance, we will witness a fundamental shift in the profile of the “typical coder”. AI will handle the grunt work, while human developers focus on the strategy, creativity and execution; the elements that drive true innovation.\
If the core skill set of a software developer moves toward applied knowledge rather than recall and traditional CS background, we could see a broader, more diverse group of technologists entering industry and shaping the future.\
By breaking away from rigid, exclusionary hiring practices, we stand a greater chance of making software that works for everyone, not just the few.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Effective Platform Engineering • Ajay Chankramath, Nic Cheneweth, Bryan Oliver, Sean Alvarez &amp; We...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_IiMhxqec</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bo_IiMhxqec?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:50:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club.

Yes, you might discover that a Senior FPA Analyst II earns the same as a Product Marketing Director I, but why does that matter?  It’s a coincidence.  It’s like saying with $3.65 I can buy either a grande non-fat latte or a head of organic lettuce.  What matters is the fair price of each of those goods in the market — not they that happen to have the same price.  So I object to the whole notion of levels across the organization.  It’s not canonical; it’s coincidence.Most leveling systems are too granular, with the levels separated by arbitrary characterizations. It’s makework.  It’s fake science.  It’s bureaucratic and encourages a non-thinking “climb the ladder” approach to career development.  (“Hey, let’s develop you to go from somewhat-independent to rather-independent this year.”)It conflates career development and salary negotiation. It encourages a mindset of saying, “what must I do to make L10” when you want to say, “I want a $10K raise.”  I can’t tell you the number of times people have asked me for “development” or “leveling” conversations where I get excited and start talking about learning, skills gaps, and such and it’s clear all they wanted to talk about was salary.  Disappointing.That said, I do believe there are three meaningful levels in management and it’s important to understand the differences among them.  I can’t tell you the number of times someone has sincerely asked me, “what does it take to be a director?” or, “how can I develop myself into a VP?”It’s a hard question.  You can turn to the leveling system for an answer, but it’s not in there.  For years, in fact, I’ve struggled to find what I consider to be a good answer to the question.I’m not talking about Senior VP vs. Executive VP or Director vs. Senior Director.  I view such adjectives as window dressing or stripes:  important recognition along the way, but nothing that fundamentally changes one’s level.I’m not talking about how many people you manage.  In call centers, a director might manage 500 people.  In startups, a VP might manage zero.I am talking about one of three levels at which people operate:  manager, director, and vice president.  Here are my definitions:Managers are paid to drive results with some support. They have experience in the function, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support.  They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision (“set and forget”). Directors know how to do the job.  They can make a project’s tactical plan in their sleep.  They can work across the organization to get it done.  I love strong directors.  They get shit done.VPs are paid to make the plan. Say you run marketing.  Your job is to understand the company’s business situation, make a plan to address it, build consensus to get approval of that plan, and then go execute it.The biggest single development issue I’ve seen over the years is that many VPs still think like directors. [1]Say the plan didn’t work.   “But, we executed the plan we agreed to,” they might say, hoping to play a get-out-of-jail-free card with the CEO (which is about to boomerang).Of course, the VP got approval to execute the plan.  Otherwise, you’d be having a different conversation, one about termination for insubordination.But the plan didn’t work.  Because directors are primarily execution engines, they can successfully play this card.  Fair enough.  Good directors challenge their plans to make them better.  But they can still play the approval card successfully because their primary duty is to execute the plan, not make it.VP’s, however, cannot play the approval card.  The VP’s job is to get the right answer.  They are the functional expert.  No one on the team knows their function better than they do.  And even if someone did, they are still playing the VP of function role and it’s their job – and no one else’s — to get the right answer.Now, you might be thinking, “glad I don’t work for Dave” right now — he’s putting failure of a plan to which he and the team agreed on the back of the VP.  And I am.But it’s the same standard to which the CEO is held.  If the CEO makes a plan, gets it approved by the board, and executes it well but it doesn’t work, they cannot tell the board “but, but, it’s the plan we agreed to.”  Most CEOs wouldn’t even dream of saying that.  It’s because CEOs understand they are held accountable not for effort or activity, but results.Part of truly operating at the VP level is to internalize this fact.  You are accountable for results.  Make a plan that you believe in.  Because if the plan doesn’t work, you can’t hide behind approval.  Your job was to make a plan that worked.  If the risk of dying on a hill is inevitable, you may as well die on your own hill, and not someone else’s.Paraphrasing the ancient Fram oil filter commercial, I call this “you can fire me now or fire me later” principle.  An executive should never sign up for a plan they don’t believe in.  They should risk being fired now for refusing to sign up for the plan (e.g., challenging assumptions, delivering bad news) as opposed to halfheartedly executing a plan they don’t believe in and almost certainly getting fired for its failure later.  The former is a far better way to go than the latter.This is important not only because it prepares the VP to one day become a  CEO, but also because it empowers the VP in making their plan.  If this my plan, if I am to be judged on its success or failure, if I am not able to use approval as a get-out-of-jail-free card, then is it the right plan?That’s the thinking I want to stimulate.  That’s how great VPs think.[1] Since big companies throw around the VP title pretty casually, this post is arguing that many of those VPs are actually directors in thinking and accountability.  This may be one reason why big company VPs have trouble adapting to the e-staff of startups.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ASUS ROG Flow Z13 Improvements For Linux, RGB Controls For The ROG Ally</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/ASUS-Z13-ROG-Ally-RGB</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:46:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A set of eleven patches being worked on for the ASUS HID and platform drivers work to enhance the support for the AMD Strix Halo powered ROG Flow Z13 (2025) laptop as well as adding RGB control support for the ROG Ally gaming handheld...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Claude Plays Pokémon - A Conversation with the Creator // David Hershey // #294</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Claude-Plays-Pokmon---A-Conversation-with-the-Creator--David-Hershey--294-e2vo053</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/99401315/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-2-5%2F396004276-44100-2-fc824b74e90d6.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:40:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I Let An AI Play Pokémon! - Claude plays Pokémon Creator // MLOps Podcast #295 with David Hershey, Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn  Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter // AbstractDemetrios chats with David Hershey from Anthropic's Applied AI team about his agent-powered Pokémon project using Claude.

Since every project or use case may require a specific date format, this pipe provides the flexibility to meet those needs effortlessly.{{ value_expression | date [ : format [ : timezone [ : locale ] ] ] }}
\
DatePipe runs only when it detects a pure change in the input value. A pure change occurs when a primitive value is modified or the object reference changes. Modifying a Date object does not trigger the pipe to re-render. To ensure the pipe executes, a new Date object must be created.\

Install angular if it is not already installednpm install -g @angular/cli
\
Create an angular app and change to directoryng new angular-examples
cd angular-examples
\
Generate new component in the components folderng generate component date-pipe-example src/app/components

Adding a direct route  in the  file to the example component for testing purposesimport { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { DatePipeExampleComponent } from '../app/components/date-pipe-example/date-pipe-example.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
    {
        path: 'datepipe',
        component: DatePipeExampleComponent
    }
];
\
Now, let's add  to the component date-pipe-example.component.ts and include various date formats in the template.import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-date-pipe-example',
  imports: [DatePipe],
  templateUrl: './date-pipe-example.component.html',
  styleUrl: './date-pipe-example.component.scss'

Testing Across Time Zones with Chrome DevToolsThis guide provides insight into how the Angular Date Pipe works with different formats. However, a common challenge is testing across various time zones and locales to see how the dates appear in the UI. In such cases, we can leverage developer tools' sensor settings for live testing.\
Google Chrome Developer Console Sensor ToolsThe Google Chrome Developer Console Sensor Tools allow developers to simulate different environmental conditions for testing web applications. These tools are part of the Chrome DevTools and are useful for testing scenarios like geolocation, device orientation, and accelerometer values.Depending on your operating system, press the following to open the  first then .On Windows, Linux, or ChromeOS, Control+Shift+IOn Windows, Linux, or ChromeOS, Control+Shift+P\n Alternatively, we can open the, click the three-dot menu, go to , and select , as shown in the screenshot below.\
By default Sensors will  option selected.\
Next, open the Location dropdown, where you’ll find several predefined locations to override. Select a location from the list, refresh the page, and observe the changes in the result.\
We could also add new locations by clicking on  button then ‘ in the Locations settings panel.\
At times, the user or browser location may not be available, which can also be tested using the  dropdown with option  \n \
The full repository for this guide project can be found here.In this post, we explored the power of Angular’s DatePipe and its flexibility in formatting dates and times to meet the varying needs of different projects. We built a simple Angular component to show various date formats and explained how to use Google Chrome Developer Tools’ sensor features to test date displays across different time zones and locales.\
For large scale projects that cover multiple time zones and have users from all over the world, handling dates and times correctly is important to providing a smooth and reliable user experience. Angular’s DatePipe eases this challenge by providing customizable formatting options and a smooth integration with different time zones and locales.  Using Chrome’s DevTools to test date formats in different environmental conditions, developers can ensure that the applications they build are correct for users around the world and, in turn, make the application more usable and reliable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Enhance Your Code Architecture With SOLID Principles (with Swift Examples)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/enhance-your-code-architecture-with-solid-principles-with-swift-examples?source=rss</link><author>Maxim Egorov</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:33:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Good architecture is not just about writing working code, but about creating code that is easy to extend, test, and maintain. This is exactly why the SOLID principles were formulated - five key foundations of object-oriented design proposed by  (Robert C. Martin).\
Following these principles helps achieve several important benefits:, making modifications easier.Minimizes the risk of errors when making changes.Makes the system more flexible and easily extensible. and automation.SOLID is an acronym consisting of five principles:S - Single Responsibility Principle - Each object should perform only one task and have only one reason to change.O - Open/Closed Principle - Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.L - Liskov Substitution Principle - Subclasses must fully replace the parent class without altering its behavior.I - Interface Segregation Principle - Classes should not be forced to implement methods they do not need.D - Dependency Inversion Principle - Modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.\
In this article, we will break down each of these principles using Swift code examples, explore common mistakes that violate these principles, and learn how to fix them. The examples will be easy to understand, so no complex language constructs will be used.\
Grab some coffee, cookies, and let's dive into SOLID! 🚀S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)According to this principle, each object should have only one responsibility, and that responsibility should be encapsulated within it.\
 The User class contains both user logic and email-sending logic.final class User {
    let name: String
    let email: String

    init(name: String, email: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    }

    func sendEmail(message: String) {
        print("Sending email to \(email) with message: \(message)")
    }
}

let user = User(name: "Tim", email: "ceo@apple.com")
user.sendEmail(message: "Hello!")
Separate responsibilities between  and .final class User {
    let name: String
    let email: String

    init(name: String, email: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    }
}

final class EmailService {
    func sendEmail(to user: User, message: String) {
        print("Sending email to \(user.email) with message: \(message)")
    }
}

let user = User(name: "Tim", email: "ceo@apple.com")
let emailService = EmailService()
emailService.sendEmail(to: user, message: "Hello!")
Now  is responsible , while  handles email sending. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend.O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)This principle states that code should be open for extension but closed for modification.\
: The function uses conditional checks to determine the payment method. Adding a new payment method requires modifying this code.final class PaymentProcessor {
    func processPayment(type: String, amount: Double) {
        if type == "credit_card" {
            print("Pay amount: \(amount) with credit card")
        } else if type == "paypal" {
            print("Pay amount: \(amount) via PayPal")
        } else {
            print("Unknown payment method")
        }
    }
}

let processor = PaymentProcessor()
processor.processPayment(type: "credit_card", amount: 100.0)
processor.processPayment(type: "paypal", amount: 200.0)
Instead of using  statements, we can  - the  protocol. This allows adding new payment methods .protocol PaymentMethod {
    func pay(amount: Double)
}

final class CreditCardPayment: PaymentMethod {
    func pay(amount: Double) {
        print("Pay amount: \(amount) with credit card")
    }
}

final class PayPalPayment: PaymentMethod {
    func pay(amount: Double) {
        print("Pay amount: \(amount) via PayPal")
    }
}

final class PaymentProcessor {
    func processPayment(method: PaymentMethod, amount: Double) {
        method.pay(amount: amount)
    }
}

let processor = PaymentProcessor()
let creditCard = CreditCardPayment()
let paypal = PayPalPayment()

processor.processPayment(method: creditCard, amount: 100.0)
processor.processPayment(method: paypal, amount: 200.0)
\
Now, if a new payment method (e.g., ) is introduced,  - we just add a new class implementing .L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)Subclasses should replace the parent class without changing the program's logic.\
: The base class  has a  method, but if we create , it should not be refueled with gasoline - it should be charged instead.final class Car {
    func drive() {
        print("Drive")
    }

    func refuel() {
        print("Refuel")
    }
}

class GasolineCar: Car { }

class ElectricCar: Car {
    override func refuel() {
        fatalError("Can't fuel an electric car with gasoline!")
    }
}

func refuelCar(_ car: Car) {
    car.refuel()
}

let tesla = ElectricCar()
refuelCar(tesla) // ❌ Runtime error
\
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  that a subclass should  replace its parent class without breaking functionality. Here, the function  expects any  to be refueled, but .Separate interfaces for refuelable and chargeable vehicles.class Car {
    func drive() {
        print("Drive")
    }
}

protocol Fuelable {
    func refuel()
}

protocol Chargeable {
    func charge()
}

final class GasolineCar: Car, Fuelable {
    func refuel() {
        print("Refuel")
    }
}

final class ElectricCar: Car, Chargeable {
    func charge() {
        print("Charge")
    }
}

// We have a function that only works with fuelable cars
func refuelCar(_ car: Fuelable) {
    car.refuel()
}

let bmw = GasolineCar()
refuelCar(bmw) // ✅

let tesla = ElectricCar()
// refuelCar(tesla) // ❌ Compile-time error, which is good! Now we can't mistakenly pass an electric car.
Now there is no LSP violation:Subclasses of  are compatible. can be refueled with gasoline.does not inherit the unnecessary method but uses  instead.:::tip
If you have classes that behave differently, it's better to separate them through interfaces rather than forcing them to inherit methods they don’t need. This not only adheres to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) but also improves code readability and maintainability.I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)The principle states that classes should not be forced to implement methods they don’t need.\
: We have a  interface that contains methods for all types of transport - , , and . However, a car cannot fly, and a boat cannot drive on the road.protocol Vehicle {
    func drive()

: Depend on , not concrete classes.By applying SOLID principles, you create code that remains stable, adaptable, and resistant to unnecessary complexity. These principles help prevent projects from turning into unmanageable chaos as they grow. Writing code with SOLID in mind ensures better organization, making it easier to maintain, test, and extend over time.\
This leads to a more structured and predictable development process.\
Although SOLID is not a rigid set of rules, it helps developers design scalable and flexible architectures.

From a report: At Nvidia's "Quantum Day" event, part of the company's annual GTC Conference, Huang admitted that his comments came out wrong. "This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong," Huang said. 

In January, Huang sent quantum computing stocks reeling when he said 15 years was "on the early side" in considering how long it would be before the technology would be useful. He said at the time that 20 years was a timeframe that "a whole bunch of us would believe." In his opening comments on Thursday, Huang drew comparisons between pre-revenue quantum companies and Nvidia's early days. He said it took over 20 years for Nvidia to build out its software and hardware business. 

He also expressed surprise that his comments were able to move markets, and joked he didn't know that certain quantum computing companies were publicly traded.

GPT-4’s price tag? A cool $169 million. That’s the reality of today’s AI ecosystem, where giants hold the keys to the computational kingdom. However, centralized AI is a house of cards.Costs are astronomical: Startups and researchers? They’re locked out.Scalability is a myth: Demand for compute grows faster than Moore’s Law.Single points of failure: One AWS outage can paralyze industries.\
Decentralized platforms like Nidum.ai, bittensor challenge this status quo by redefining access to computational power. By aggregating underutilized hardware—idle GPUs in gaming rigs, decommissioned mining farms, and regional data centers—these networks create a global resource pool that operates on principles of shared efficiency. For startups and researchers, this isn’t just about affordability—it’s about survival in a market where OpenAI’s $100 million training runs set an untenable precedent.How Decentralization Unshackles AIEnter blockchain—the tech behind Bitcoin—and its rebellious ethos. Imagine a global network where anyone can contribute compute power, like Airbnb for GPUs. By distributing computational resources across a global network of nodes, decentralized AI can reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance transparency. More and more companies have realized the importance of AI - bitsCrunch just acquired Nidum.ai a few weeks ago, which is one of examples of this movement, providing a decentralized AI computing platform that connects developers with distributed resources worldwide. \
Below is a flowchart showing how data and computational resources move in centralized systems versus decentralized systems (e.g., Nidum, Aleph Cloud). Decentralized network of nodes to provide high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities for AI developers, and it allows developers to embed AI-driven features—predictive analytics, personalized recommendations—directly into smart contracts. The result is a new class of hybrid applications.\
Each node’s contribution is logged on-chain. No more shadowy data sources. No more biased models escaping scrutiny. It’s accountability, baked into code. But here’s the real magic: tokenized incentives. Contribute compute power, earn crypto. This isn’t just tech utopianism—it’s a self-sustaining economy where everyone wins.Decentralized networks rely on tokenized incentives to sustain participation. Contributors who lease idle GPU capacity earn cryptocurrency, creating a circular economy where resource providers fund their own AI projects. While this model has critics—some argue it risks commodifying compute power—it mirrors proven sharing-economy principles. Airbnb and Uber demonstrated that underutilized assets (homes, cars) can be productized at scale; decentralized AI applies this logic to silicon.\
Picture this: A chatbot that spills the raw truth about a smart contract, running on your device or our decentralised setup. Or a DeFi platform tapping into heavy-duty insights from a censorship-free engine, all powered by an infrastructure that’s open to everyone.\
This isn’t sci-fi—it’s happening now. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge, up from 10% in 2021. Decentralized architectures are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this shift. For example, a manufacturer using Nidum’s edge nodes can deploy AI to monitor assembly line defects in real time, analyzing sensor data on-site without exposing proprietary information to third-party clouds.The AI revolution isn’t about building god-like models—it’s about who controls them. Decentralization isn’t a buzzword; it’s the antidote to corporate capture.\
The road ahead is complex, but the direction is clear: AI’s future isn’t just decentralized. It’s inevitable.\
So, next time you hear “AI,” think beyond ChatGPT. Think about farmers, doctors, and Reddit mods reclaiming power. Because the future of AI isn’t a server farm—it’s a community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Want AI to Actually Understand Your Code?

CocoIndex is a tool to help you index and query your data. It is designed to be used as a framework to build your own data pipeline. CocoIndex provides built-in support for code base chunking, with native Tree-sitter support.Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library, it is available in Rust 🦀 - GitHub. CocoIndex has built-in Rust integration with Tree-sitter to efficiently parse code and extract syntax trees for various programming languages.\
Codebase chunking is the process of breaking down a codebase into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks. CocoIndex leverages Tree-sitter's capabilities to intelligently chunk code based on the actual syntax structure rather than arbitrary line breaks. These semantically coherent chunks are then used to build a more effective index for RAG systems, enabling more precise code retrieval and better context preservation.\
Fast pass 🚀 - you can find the full code here. Only ~ 50 lines of Python code for the RAG pipeline, check it out 🤗!Please give CocoIndex on Github a star to support us if you like our work. Thank you so much with a warm coconut hug 🥥🤗. If you don't have Postgres installed, please refer to the installation guide. CocoIndex uses Postgres to manage the data index, we have it on our roadmap to support other databases, including the in-progress ones. If you are interested in other databases, please let us know by creating a GitHub issue or Discord.Let's define the cocoIndex flow to read from a codebase and index it for RAG.\
The flow diagram above illustrates how we'll process our codebase:Read code files from the local filesystemSplit code into semantic chunks using Tree-sitterGenerate embeddings for each chunkStore in a vector database for retrieval\
Let's implement this flow step by step.1. Add the codebase as a source.​@cocoindex.flow_def(name="CodeEmbedding")
def code_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    """
    Define an example flow that embeds files into a vector database.
    """
    data_scope["files"] = flow_builder.add_source(
        cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path="../..",
                                    included_patterns=["*.py", "*.rs", "*.toml", "*.md", "*.mdx"],
                                    excluded_patterns=[".*", "target", "**/node_modules"]))
    code_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()
In this example, we are going to index the cocoindex codebase from the root directory. You can change the path to the codebase you want to index. We will index all the files with the extensions of , , , , , and skip directories starting with ., target (in the root) and node_modules (under any directory). will create a table with the following sub fields, see documentation here. (key, type: ): the filename of the file, e.g.  (type:  if  is , otherwise ): the content of the file2. Process each file and collect the information.​First let's define a function to extract the extension of a filename while processing each file. You can find the documentation for custom function here.@cocoindex.op.function()
def extract_extension(filename: str) -> str:
    """Extract the extension of a filename."""
    return os.path.splitext(filename)[1]
\
Then we are going to process each file and collect the information.    # ...
    with data_scope["files"].row() as file:
        file["extension"] = file["filename"].transform(extract_extension)
\
Here we extract the extension of the filename and store it in the  field. for example, if the filename is , the  field will be .2.2 Split the file into chunks​Next, we are going to split the file into chunks. We use the  function to split the file into chunks. You can find the documentation for the function here.\
CocoIndex provides built-in support for Tree-sitter, so you can pass in the language to the  parameter. To see all supported language names and extensions, see the documentation here. All the major languages are supported, e.g., Python, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, etc. If it's unspecified or the specified language is not supported, it will be treated as plain text.  with data_scope["files"].row() as file:
    # ...
      file["chunks"] = file["content"].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=file["extension"], chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=300) 
We will use the  function to embed the chunks. You can find the documentation for the function here. There are 12k models supported by 🤗 Hugging Face. You can just pick your favorite model. def code_to_embedding(text: cocoindex.DataSlice) -> cocoindex.DataSlice:
    """
    Embed the text using a SentenceTransformer model.
    """
    return text.transform(
        cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
            model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"))
\
Then for each chunk, we will embed it using the  function. and collect the embeddings to the  collector.\
We extract this codeembedding function instead of directly calling transform(cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(…)) in place.\
This is because we want to make this one shared between the indexing flow building and the query handler definition. Alternatively, to make it simpler. It's also OK to avoid this extra function and directly do things in place - not a big deal to copy paste a little bit, we did this for the quickstart project.    with data_scope["files"].row() as file:
        # ...
        with file["chunks"].row() as chunk:
            chunk["embedding"] = chunk["text"].call(code_to_embedding)
            code_embeddings.collect(filename=file["filename"], location=chunk["location"],
                                    code=chunk["text"], embedding=chunk["embedding"])
2.4 Collect the embeddings​Finally, let's export the embeddings to a table.    code_embeddings.export(
        "code_embeddings",
        cocoindex.storages.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=["filename", "location"],
        vector_index=[("embedding", cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
3. Setup Query Handler for your index​We will use the SimpleSemanticsQueryHandler to query the index. Note that we need to pass in the  function to the  parameter. This is because the query handler will use the same embedding model as the one used in the flow.query_handler = cocoindex.query.SimpleSemanticsQueryHandler(
    name="SemanticsSearch",
    flow=code_embedding_flow,
    target_name="code_embeddings",
    query_transform_flow=code_to_embedding,
    default_similarity_metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)
\
Define a main function to run the query handler.@cocoindex.main_fn()
def _run():
    # Run queries in a loop to demonstrate the query capabilities.
    while True:
        try:
            query = input("Enter search query (or Enter to quit): ")
            if query == '':
                break
            results, _ = query_handler.search(query, 10)
            print("\nSearch results:")
            for result in results:
                print(f"[{result.score:.3f}] {result.data['filename']}")
                print(f"    {result.data['code']}")
                print("---")
            print()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    load_dotenv(override=True)
    _run()
\
The @cocoindex.main_fn() decorator initializes the library with settings loaded from environment variables. See documentation for initializationfor more details.Run the index setup & update​Run following commands to setup and update the index.python main.py cocoindex setup
python main.py cocoindex update
\
You'll see the index updates state in the terminal\
At this point, you can start the cocoindex server and develop your RAG runtime against the data.\
To test your index, there are two options:Option 1: Run the index server in the terminal​\
When you see the prompt, you can enter your search query. for example: spec.Enter search query (or Enter to quit): spec
\
You can find the search results in the terminal\
The returned results - each entry contains score (Cosine Similarity), filename, and the code snippet that get matched. At cocoindex, we use the cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY to measure the similarity between the query and the indexed data. You can switch to other metrics too and quickly test it out.\
To learn more about Consine Similarity, see Wiki.\n Option 2: Run CocoInsight to understand your data pipeline and data index​\
CocoInsight is a tool to help you understand your data pipeline and data index. It connects to your local CocoIndex server with zero data retention.\
CocoInsight is in Early Access now (Free) 😊 You found us! A quick 3 minute video tutorial about CocoInsight: Watch on YouTube.Run the CocoIndex server​python main.py cocoindex server -c https://cocoindex.io
\
Once the server is running, open CocoInsight in your browser. You'll be able to connect to your local CocoIndex server and explore your data pipeline and index.\
On the right side, you can see the data flow that we defined.\
On the left side, you can see the data index in the data preview.You can click on any row to see the details of that data entry, including the full content of code chunks and their embeddings.We love to hear from the community! You can find us on Github and Discord.\

I was there when this new blockchain technology was supposed to improve the world by enhancing everything it touched. It was supposed to make money more effective and better to use and have a way to pay SWs without getting blocked by payment providers or have ownership of data and use a wallet to sign in to services instead of the data harvesting social logins, or even to improve privacy and help to get something back from the MAN by making cash deposits and receiving digital currencies in return, but now that is a distant dream.\
When the blockchain bonanza began, I found myself in Amsterdam working in the cannabis industry. I witnessed firsthand the need for privacy and the need for a currency that could somehow circumvent the all-seeing eye of the taxman, who collects a toll for the privilege of doing business on the ground. This led me to the rabbit hole. After jumping in with a concrete purpose, a few years later, rampant decadence and depravity replaced the vision.These two words can make or break a project. With the prevalence of the easy turnover that memecoins, assets based on everything from viral characters to animals (strangely, mostly dogs), political figures, and everything in between, the notion of fundamentals and the basis of a utility in a network has taken the back seat, leaving many projects with legitimate uses and benefits of network effects built in becoming all but forgotten in a landscape that has achieved mass adoption at the sake of \
In this short piece, we will cover the example of the SORA network, a misunderstood outlier within Polkadot, an even more misunderstood ecosystem. We will also cover where the crypto space came from what it was trying to achieve, then what it has become. Finally, we will wrap it all up with some food for thought: Is every non-performing asset a scam, or are you just a degenerate eager for easy money? How does this impact the crypto space as a whole?\
It is doubtful that when Satoshi wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper, they intended to make it an asset that would eventually be traded as an exchange-traded fund, let alone become such a massively speculated asset. Suppose the main goal was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system™. In that case, it seems the current meta has gone full circle beyond the initial objectives and become what it had set out to replace, further exacerbated by Ethereum and the “” that brought us to this point.With the technology to make finance available to everyone and a lovely group of overnight millionaires who had money to spend, the first wave brought about decentralised lending, perpetual, and other financial instruments that were out of the hands of the masses and reserved for bankers and speculators; this floodgate allowed people to fill their respective bags and reap the benefits of a nascent technology.The term “tokenomics” was coined, making it so that the tokens are bound to these rules that define how many exist, what their allocations are and how they would be made available.\
The term “tokenomics” was coined, making it so that the tokens are bound to these rules that define how many exist, what their allocations are (how many the team keeps, investors, for development runway, marketing, etc.) and how they would be made available (vesting, etc.). People study these aspects and, combined with their fundamentals (raison d’etre), decide whether to buy this token. If the token is new, it is allocated into a presale, which is then put on an exchange, and this will define the base value. The token can be subject to market forces, so put equally with the funds raised as the liquidity pair.:::info
The proportion of the pair will define the price in this scenario, so if paired with ETH, ETH>TOKEN, it will be more expensive, and ETH\
This, combined with a capped supply, would define a token's value. This was also the time when founders would pull the rug from under eager investors' feet (), which led to mechanisms like vesting presale tokens and other means to avoid these unfortunate circumstances; just like the third wave, you had to be there to see it, Billy. It was glorious, and when that wave crashed and receded, we were left with something interesting and very low-res.The Second Wave, JPEG AttacksBlockchain brought about one of the most controversial eras of intellectual property, which even extended to the carbon footprint of blockchains, in the purest demonstration of the arbitrary nature of ownership, computer-generated, highly pixelated images of characters ranging from women, apes, and flat eric overtook fine arts in value and sales. Michaelangelo was rolling in his grave as punks with four-digit identifiers raked in the six digits, and more “visionaries” filled orders in Lamborghini dealerships.\
This era was almost as decadent as the first, but the bubble burst, and all the would-be wealthy had (digital) wallets full of worthless pixels. It is a good point in the story to mention that so far, digital gold, Bitcoin and its silver counterpart, Ethereum, were the key players in the game; there was a third gearing up to take centre stage (for the right reasons), but up until now was known for a series of fundamental face plants in the form of their blockchain stopping. (If you are not acquainted with the blockchain space, one of the main characteristics is that the blockchain must be unstoppable, so if this unfortunate situation were to happen to you, the chain would be the butt of the joke). That didn’t stop the little blockchain that could, so it stood up, brushed off the dust and decided to do something about it.The Meme Coin Era, Anyone Can Make a Token.After Solana addressed the issues that made it (in)famous, the focus on speed and ease of use brought about the latest and most impactful wave of them all, the advent of the meme coin. Indeed, “” meme coins were already around, but once making a token became as easy as naming it and setting a maximum supply, the third wave has been washing away any traces of “” that cryptocurrencies could have brought to the table. To add insult to injury, the resulting flying carpets were unstoppable in nature, none of that vested token release to save you from early liquidity pull-outs, you were on your own, bubba.The internet is rife with examples of how the blockchain space has gone from being the technology that promised to bring back privacy and foster ownership to dealing with gambling chips on an immutable ledger.Read any headline in the several publications dedicated to covering the industry. You’ll find the mention of a meme, a Solana meme, in a few of them every day at the risk of being the old man shouting at the cloud (or chain), the idealistic utilities that blockchains in the first wave brought continue to be washed away by the meme wave. To everyone’s surprise, Solana is one of the top-valued chains, which a blockchain scholar would have scoffed at had you told them this is the outcome.\
But what happened to these projects that had a cause? Naturally, unless the reason is fast and furious profit, they have been left on the sidelines, still going through a strong community that believes in the difference the technology makes. Indeed, this was always about the technology, right? Several solutions around the developed world already take care of instant payments, so the average developed-world user would not see the need for such a solution.\
Your average crypto degen is somehow against the widespread benefits, citing things like CBDC as a way for the government to have full access to your finances (which, unless you use cash for all your purchases, is already the case) or as a way to implement a social credit that would freeze your access to money if the government deemed you a risk (which has been forbidden from the get-go by the BIS), so we are left with little other uses for a financial technology like this.Of course, this is not the case, as proven by the blockchain of blockchains, now pivoting toward an internet computer (), where all of these chains, sharing a common base infrastructure, can focus on their specific applications, things like Polimec to provide VC for projects, Encointer as proof of personhood protocol that doesn’t steal your retinas, NeuroWeb hosts decentralised knowledge, Subsocial is the precursor of an on-chain social media, and many other projects that have utility at their core.\
You also find decentralised finance in all its shades, metaverses, the Internet of Things, and network infrastructure like bridges and identity hosts. All of these utilities are available in the ecosystem, which attracts more headlines because of its sponsorship of racecar drivers or football teams than the innovations it provides. Within this ecosystem, there is an outlier that best exemplifies the case it points to: a decentralised central bank…The Supranational Output Rationalisation AllianceAfter WWII, Japan was suffering the aftermath of atomic destruction and the economic toll of war. The people, who have always stood out for their resilience and dedication toward their craft did not stand still and wait for handouts from the winning side, instead, they did what they knew how to do best, work, create and innovate. Thanks to support from the Central Bank, which focused on providing funds for productive output, the Japanese Economic miracle came about (you can watch the fleshed-out explanation here).\
Back to the Alliance, this token has an elastic supply, which increases through governance and decreases through network effects (more usage means more tokens burnt and eventually less supply), similar to a currency and  a gambling chip token. It is not bound to the retail supply and demand rules, so it is misunderstood and labelled a scam. This leads to less token use, more supply required, and a vicious cycle where the high level of difficulty has left the highly fundamental project on the sidelines while the simple meme is making headlines for the sake of existing.What can we take from the combination of the waves and the examples of projects with fundamentals? Was this all a long rant by someone with no trading experience and is sour at the market? I won't blame you for thinking this is the objective, as it certainly comes across this way to the sceptic. Please take a moment to consider that cryptocurrency's critical mass mainstream adoption utility was for it to replace or at least complement fiat currency; looking at the current application of the highest-valued cryptos, this is a far cry. The primary use case is to sell and eventually dump for fiat. The state of the world, meanwhile, also requires fast outputs of money, higher inflation leading to higher costs and lower salaries, conflicts that alter the prices of market essentials and outbreaks of disease that lead to supply cuts are all part of a more significant problem that is reflected in the current state of crypto as an easy way out from a problem that a salary cannot solve.\
Meanwhile, developing countries are making strides, Cambodia has a CBDC and some island in the Pacific with a funny name is doing feasibility testing to implement digital currencies. The supply and demand of generic tokens do not satisfy the needs that blockchain technology sets out to solve because the obstacles are too high. Still, they also demand input and action from those who use them. Decentralisation demands participation in governance and demands skin in the game to make markets; financial inclusion requires a knowledge curve to use a wallet and remember a mnemonic, which can be easily substituted by a custodial account, which offers the same assets and can be easily accessed in case passwords are forgotten. Still, when something happens, there is no recovering what was lost.The automatic assumption that any token that does not pump is a scam or a rugpull comes across as a degenerate response, akin to a tweaker once the high subsides.\
The visionary innovations that have been relegated to the bottom of the ladder are not unique cases; when the user does not go beyond the basic rules of supply and demand nor seeks greater accountability from the world around them, it is easy to project these sentiments to projects that you don’t see moving the needle. The automatic assumption that any token that does not pump is a scam or a rug pull comes across as a degenerate response, akin to a tweaker once the high subsides, the anxious itch and desperate twitch that the void of endorphins has left was once the desire for likes, or the thirst for follows, but when it boils down to it, you are the problem, anon.:::warning

My name is Kiryl Famin, and I am an iOS developer.\
Today, I want to thoroughly examine such a simple topic as initializers in Swift. Despite its apparent simplicity, sometimes the lack of a  understanding of this topic leads to frustrating errors that one wants to fix quickly without delving into the details.\
In this article, we will cover everything related to initializers, including:How to retain structure’s memberwise initializer while defining a custom oneWhy it is not always necessary to write an initializer in classesWhy calling  is not always required in a designated initializerWhy all fields of a subclass must be populated before calling How to access all parent initializers with minimal overrides in subclassesWhen exactly a  initializer is neededWhy  is always called without parameters, but  and  are overridden…and more. But let’s take it step by step.Retaining a memberwise initializerRetaining superclass' convenience initializerMinimizing the number of overrides initializer: generics, protocols, ,  without parameters is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure, or enumeration for use. This process involves setting an initial value for each stored property on that instance and performing any other setup or initialization that’s required before the new instance is ready for use.\
  You implement this initialization process by defining , which are like special methods that can be called to create a new instance of a particular type. Unlike Objective-C initializers, Swift initializers don’t return a value. Their primary role is to ensure that new instances of a type are correctly initialized before they’re used for the first time.\
Well, i guess i don’t have to add anything here.Let’s start by discussing structure initializers. This is quite simple since there is no inheritance, but there are still some rules you must know about.Let’s write a simple structure:struct BankAccount {

        let amount: Double
        let isBlocked: Bool
}

let bankAccount = BankAccount(amount: 735, isBlocked: Bool)
\
Notice that we were able to initialize the structure without explicitly declaring an initializer. This happens because structures receive a  generated by the compiler. This works .\
By selecting Refactor → Generate memberwise initializer, you can see how it looks:init(amount: Double, isBlocked: Bool) {
    self.amount = amount
    self.isBlocked = isBlocked
}
\
From the signature, it’s easy to see that failing to provide values for all parameters will result in a compilation error:let bankAccount = BankAccount(amount: 735) // ❌ Missing argument for parameter 'isBlocked' in call
\
However, if you want to reduce the number of required arguments, you can define a custom initializer:init(amount: Double, isBlocked: Bool = false) {
        self.amount = amount
        isBlocked = isBlocked
}

let bankAccount = BankAccount(amount: 735) // ✅
\
Note that if  is not populated, this will result in a compilation error because all structure properties must be populated in an initializer.The only case where a field does not need to be populated  is when it is an  ()  (). In such cases, the field will default to :struct BankAccount {

    let amount: Double
    var isBlocked: Bool?

    init(amount: Double) {
        self.amount = amount
    }
}

let bankAccount = BankAccount(amount: 735) // ✅
\
However, if we try to use the memberwise initializer in this case, we will get a compilation error:let bankAccount = BankAccount(
        amount: 735,
        isBlocked: false
) // ❌ Extra argument 'isBlocked' in call
Retaining a memberwise initializerThis happens because declaring a custom initializer removes the memberwise initializer. It is still possible to define it explicitly, but it will not be available automatically.\
However, there is a small trick to retain the memberwise initializer: declare the custom initializer in an .struct BankAccount {

    let amount: Double
    var isBlocked: Bool?
}

extension BankAccount {

        init(amount: Double) {
                self.amount = amount
      }
}

let barclaysBankAccount = BankAccount(amount: 735) // ✅
let revolutBankAccount = BankAccount(amount: 812, isBlocked: false) // ✅

print(barclaysBankAccount.isBlocked) // nil
print(barclaysBankAccount.isBlocked) // false
==All fields must be populated in an initializer====Optional==  ==fields default to== ==Structures receive a free memberwise initializer====The memberwise initializer disappears if a custom initializer is declared====To retain structure’s memberwise initializer, define a custom one in an== The primary initializer for a class is the . It serves two purposes:Ensures that all fields are populatedIf the class is inherited, it calls the superclass initializerclass Animal {

    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class Dog: Animal {

    var breed: String
    var name: String

    init(breed: String, name: String) {
        self.breed = breed

        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
\
All fields  calling . This is because the superclass initializer may call methods overridden by the subclass, which could access unpopulated subclass properties.class Animal {

    var age: Int

    init(age: Int) {
        self.age = age

        getInfo()
    }

    func getInfo() {
            print("Age: ", age)
    }
}

class Dog: Animal {

    var breed: String

    init(breed: String, age: Int) {
        self.breed = breed // imagine we haven't done this

        super.init(age: age)
    }

    override func getInfo() {
            print("Age: ", age, ", breed: ", breed)
    }
}
\
Thus, if we had not set , we would have encountered a runtime error because the  initializer would have called the overridden  method from the  class. This method attempts to access the property, which would not yet be populated.\
Unlike structures, classes do not receive an implicit memberwise initializer. If there are uninitialized properties, a compilation error occurs:class Animal { // ❌ Class 'Animal' has no initializers

    var age: Int
}
class Animal { // ✅

    var age: Int = 0
}
class Animal { // ✅

    var age: Int?
}
Classes can also have a . Unlike designated initializers, they do not create an object from scratch but simplify the initialization process by reusing the logic of other initializers.class Rectangle {

    var width: Double
    var height: Double

    init(width: Double, height: Double) {
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }

    convenience init(side: Double) {
        self.init(width: side, height: side) // uses a designated initializer of self
    }
}
\
Convenience initializers can call either designated initializers or other convenience initializers. Ultimately, a designated initializer will always be called.\
==Convenience initializers always go horizontal (self.init), and designated initializers go vertical (super.init).==Retaining Superclass’ Convenience InitializerAs soon as a subclass declares new properties, it loses access to all of the superclass’s convenience initializers.class Animal {

    var age: Int
    var name: String

    init(age: Int, name: String) {
        self.age = age
        self.name = name
    }

    convenience init(age: Int) {
        self.init(age: age, name: "Default")
    }

    convenience init(name: String) {
        self.init(age: 0, name: name)
    }
}

class Dog: Animal {

    var breed: String

    init(age: Int, name: String, breed: String) {
        self.breed = breed

        super.init(age: age, name: name)
    }
}

let dog = Dog(age: 3) // ❌ Missing arguments for parameters 'breed', 'name' in call
\
This can be fixed by overriding all of the superclass’s designated initializers.class Dog: Animal {

    // ...

    override init(age: Int, name: String) {
        self.breed = "Mixed"

        super.init(age: age, name: name)
    }
}

let dog = Dog(age: 3) // ✅
\
It is easy to see that, in this way, to use a convenience initializer in the next subclass, you need to override  initializers.class GuideDog: Dog {

    var isTrained: Bool

    override init(age: Int, name: String) {
        self.isTrained = false

        super.init(age: age, name: name)
    }

    override init(age: Int, name: String, breed: String) {
        self.isTrained = false

        super.init(age: age, name: name, breed: breed)
    }

    init(age: Int, name: String, breed: String, isTrained: Bool) {
        self.isTrained = isTrained

        super.init(age: age, name: name, breed: breed)
    }
}

let dog = GuideDog(age: 3) // ✅
Minimizing the number of overridesHowever, this can be avoided by using a convenience override initializer.class Dog: Animal {

    var breed: String

    convenience override init(age: Int, name: String) {
        self.init(age: age, name: name, breed: "Mixed") // self, not super
    }

    init(age: Int, name: String, breed: String) {
        self.breed = breed

        super.init(age: age, name: name)
    }
}

class GuideDog: Dog {

    var isTrained: Bool

    //  override init(age: Int, name: String) {
    //      self.isTrained = false
    //      
    //      super.init(age: age, name: name, breed: "Mixed")
    //  }

    convenience override init(age: Int, name: String, breed: String) {
        self.init(age: age, name: name, breed: breed, isTrained: false) // self, not super
    }

    init(age: Int, name: String, breed: String, isTrained: Bool) {
        self.isTrained = isTrained

        super.init(age: age, name: name, breed: breed)
    }
}

let dog = GuideDog(age: 3) // ✅
\
Now we have only 2 explicitly specified initializers in each subclass.:::tip
Notice how convenience override initializers call designated init instead of .This trick is thoroughly explained in Chapter 5 of Swift in Depth by Tjeerd in 't Veen, a book I highly recommend.A  ensures that all properties are populated and calls .A  simplifies initialization by calling a designated initializer.A  becomes unavailable to subclasses if they declare new properties.To restore a superclass’s , all of its designated initializers must be overridden.To minimize the number of overrides, a convenience override initializer can be used.We have already discussed that if a subclass does not introduce new parameters, it automatically inherits all of the superclass’s initializers.class Base {

    let value: Int

    init() {
        value = 0
    }

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }
}

class Subclass: Base { }

let subclass = Subclass() // ✅
let subclass = Subclass(value: 3) // ✅
\
However, there is another important point: if the superclass has only one designated initializer and it is parameterless ( without arguments), then explicitly declared initializers in the subclass  to call . In this case, the Swift compiler  the call to the available  without arguments.class Base {

    init() { }
}

class Subclass: Base {

    let secondValue: Int

    init(secondValue: Int) {
        self.secondValue = secondValue // ✅ without explicit super.init()
    }
}
\
The code compiles because  is implicitly called. This is crucial for some of the following examples.A  initializer is used in all cases where a subclass must have the same initializer as the base class. It must also call . Below are examples where a  initializer is necessary.Calling  on a generic type is only possible by declaring it as a .class Base { }

class Subclass: Base { }

struct Factory<T: Base> {

    func initInstance() -> T { // ❌ Constructing an object of class
        T()                    // type 'T' with a metatype value
    }                          // must use a 'required' initializer
}
\
This code does not compile because  does not know anything about the subclasses of . Although in this particular case,  does have an  without parameters, imagine if it introduced a new field:class Subclass: Base {

    let value: Int

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }
}
\
Here, it no longer has an empty , so it must be declared as .class Base {

    required init() { }
}

class Subclass: Base { }

struct Factory<T: Base> {

    static func initInstance() -> T { // ✅
        T()
    }
}

let subclass = Factory<Subclass>.initInstance()
\
Notice that even though we did not explicitly declare  in , the compiler generated it for us. This was discussed in . The  was automatically inherited and called .class Subclass: Base {

        required init() {
                super.init()
        }
}
All initializers declared in protocols must be :protocol Initable {

    init()
}

class InitableObject: Initable {

    init() { // ❌ Initializer requirement 'init()' can only 
             // be satisfied by a 'required' initializer 
    }        // in non-final class 'InitableObject'
}
\
Again, this is necessary so that the compiler ensures that the subclass implements the protocol initializer. As we already know, this does not always happen—if  is not , the subclass is not obligated to override it and may define its own initializer.class IntValue: InitableObject {

    let value: Int

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }
}

let InitableType: Initable.Type = IntValue.self
let initable: Initable = InitableType.init()
\
Of course, the following code will not compile because  is not .class InitableObject: Initable {

    required init() { } // ✅
}

class IntValue: InitableObject {

    let value: Int

    required init() {
            self.value = 0
    }

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }
}
A similar situation occurs when calling the  initializer in static methods.class Base {

    let value: Int

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }

    static func instantiate() -> Self {
        Self(value: 3) // ❌ Constructing an object of class type 'Self' 
    }                  // with a metatype value must use a 'required' initializer
}
\
As always, the issue lies in inheritance:class Subclass: BaseClass {

    let anotherValue: Int

    init(anotherValue: Int) {
        self.anotherValue = anotherValue
    }
}

let subclass = Subclass.instantiate() // ❌
class BaseClass {

    let value: Int

    required init(value: Int) { // ✅
        self.value = value
    }

    static func instantiate() -> Self {
        Self(value: 3)
    }
}
Getting rid of : Since the purpose of  is to enforce the implementation of an initializer in subclasses, naturally, prohibiting inheritance using the  keyword removes the need to mark an initializer as .protocol Initable {

    init()
}

final class InitableObject: Initable { } // ✅
protocol ValueInitable {

    init(value: Int)
}

final class ValueInitableObject: ValueInitable {

    init(value: Int) { } // ✅
}
If a subclass does not introduce new parameters, it automatically inherits all initializers from its superclass.If the superclass only has  without parameters, it is called automatically in subclass initializers.A  initializer is needed to guarantee its presence in subclasses for use in generics, protocols, and .A brief mention of the  initializer without parameters, which cannot be found in the documentation but is mysteriously used everywhere.\
The reason is that  inherits from , which has an  without parameters. , this initializer is not explicitly declared in the  interface, yet it is still available:@available(iOS 2.0, *)
@MainActor open class UIView : UIResponder, NSCoding, UIAppearance, UIAppearanceContainer, UIDynamicItem, UITraitEnvironment, UICoordinateSpace, UIFocusItem, UIFocusItemContainer, CALayerDelegate {

    open class var layerClass: AnyClass { get }

    public init(frame: CGRect)

    public init?(coder: NSCoder)

    open var isUserInteractionEnabled: Bool

    // no init()
\
However, under the hood, this initializer calls  when initialized in code or  when initialized via Interface Builder. This happens because  provides its own implementation of , which can be confirmed by the fact that  returns different addresses for  and .A failable init is just one that returns an optionalfinal class Failable {

    let positiveValue: Int

    init?(value: Int) {
        guard value > 0 else { return nil }

        positiveValue = value
    }
}
Enums with a raw value get a free enum Direction: String {

    case north
    case west
    case south
    case east
}

let north = Direction(rawValue: "north")
You can also create a custom init for enums. All enum inits must assign .enum DeviceType {

    case phone
    case tablet

    init(screenWidth: Int) {
        self = screenWidth > 800 ? .tablet : .phone

Here&apos;s How to Not Mess Up the Customer Experience</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/preparing-for-a-busy-sales-season-heres-how-to-not-mess-up-the-customer-experience?source=rss</link><author>Joanna Clark Simpson</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:57:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to predicting consumer trends, 2025 has created some interesting dynamics. Consumer trends reflect uncertainty over the economy and inflation, as well as close monitoring of spending and high expectations when money is spent.\
The pressure is on business owners, and it’s crucial to keep close tabs on consumer trends as the year progresses. From sustainability to convenience, customers want it all, and they are willing to reward companies that provide what they seek.Dependable Delivery Drives Customer SatisfactionAccording to a consumer trends report, one of the most common complaints about companies is delivery issues. Customers are frustrated by companies with long or inconsistent delivery schedules and woe to the company that fails to deliver an order when promised.\
The consumer issues with delivery create an opportunity for business owners willing to lean into logistics. Shift your focus from discounts and web design to delivery options. Provide customers with guaranteed delivery time frames and options, and be sure that you’re moving at the right pace with the right systems on your end to meet those guarantees.Customers Scrutinize Product and Service ValueMany consumers face high prices and tight cash, which drives many consumer trends. One such trend is the increasing impact of the total customer experience. With fewer dollars to spend, the average consumer wants to be sure they are getting the best product and the best service for the money they spend.\
The experience customers have with your company matters just as much as the items or services they buy, and you can earn more if you’re providing a terrific experience. PWC found that there is a 16% price premium as well as brand loyalty awarded to companies that create a great experience.\
Customers look to wait times, agent interactions, refunds, and resolutions as the litmus test for customer experience.  will walk away from a company after just one bad experience. Be the company that builds brand loyalty by refining your refund and return practices, adding AI options to help customers with simple needs more quickly, and training your agents well to personalize customer service interactions in a way that makes customers feel seen and heard.Customers Are Growing Frustrated with BNPL OptionsBuy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options are increasing in number, currently accounting for  of the global market share and being most used in the United States. However, consumer insights are also forecasting a growing distrust of BNPL services. While customers may opt to use BNPL services to spread out payments for bigger ticket purchases, they are also complaining more about hidden fees, unclear repayment terms, and delayed resolutions.\
This consumer trend reflects the care households are taking with their funds as the economy tightens and budgets respond accordingly. Families are careful with funds, often choosing to spread payments out over time, but they are also demanding transparency with these services and adequate customer support.\
As a business owner, research BNPL options for your customers. But be sure to find companies that meet customers’ needs. Partnering with a BNPL service that frustrates customers instead of helping them can easily tarnish your business simply by proximity.Consumer insights and online reviews tell us that customer feedback and customer spending go hand in hand, and this really shows up in customer complaints.\
As you prepare for bigger spending seasons like summer or the holiday season, prepare for an increase in customer frustration as well. Prepare your customer service and sales agents to be patient and understanding and to look for opportunities to personalize the sales experience. McKinsey found that  will easily switch products or brands when they don’t get what they want.\
Pour just a bit more into the customer experience with increased delivery logistics, training around refunds and returns, and increased hours or bandwidth around Valentine’s Day, back-to-school time, and when the summer travel season starts. Customers are ready to offer feedback in reviews and on social media – be sure they’re providing the right kind.Adaptability Is Always Rewarded2025 consumer trends tell us that customers are seeking high-quality customer experience, dependable shipping and delivery options, seamless return and refund policies, and increased transparency across the full shopping and buying experience.\
It is still relatively early in 2025, and much is shifting in the economic and political landscape. Companies that remain nimble and adaptable while providing genuine, excellent customer experiences will always remain competitive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vulkan 1.4.311 Released With New Extension For BFloat16</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Vulkan-1.4.311-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Vulkan 1.4.311 specification update is out today with a handful of issues resolved with various clarifications and other subtle refinements.

When Jean-Yves Thibaudet visited NPR to play a Tiny Desk, everything about him was stylish. His shoes were custom made for him by the late Vivienne Westwood, his jacket was by Simon Porte Jacquemus, his necklace, Cartier.

When he sat down to play, arguably only one thing seemed to be missing: a shiny, 9-foot grand piano. But Thibaudet, like many great pianists who have graced our office space, understands the vibe of our beloved little concert series. He knows that the point is not to be playing on the largest piano possible. Instead, he delighted in bringing music by Villa-Lobos, Brahms and Ravel to our diminutive — but meticulously groomed — upright. And the colors and textures he conjured from that trusty box of wood and wire was unforgettable.

Thibaudet begins with a firecracker of a piece from the early 20th century — two-minutes of effervescence by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Watch the pianist’s fingers in a blur, stabbing hundreds of notes like a sewing machine. It was an encore favorite of the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Thibaudet explains.    

What follows could not be more different. The Intermezzo Op. 118, No. 2, is classic late Brahms, filled with muted, fall afternoon light and whispered inner voices. Thibaudet ends with a tribute to one of his idols, Maurice Ravel, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated far and wide. Turns out that one of the composer’s biggest hits, the Pavane for a Dead Princess, was not among his own favorites. And the evocative title was merely tacked on as a poetic afterthought. Still, the wide palette of coloring and shading Thibaudet offers is a masterclass in how to make an upright piano sound like a symphony orchestra. 

SET LIST
Heitor Villa-Lobos: “O polichinelo” (from A prole do bebê No. 1)
Johannes Brahms: Intermezzo in A major, Op. 118, No. 2

From the report: For years, Clearview AI has collected billions of photos from social media websites including Facebook, LinkedIn and others and sold access to its facial recognition tool to law enforcement. The collection and sale of user-generated photos by a private surveillance company to police without that person's knowledge or consent sparked international outcry when it was first revealed by the New York Times in 2020. 

New documents obtained by 404 Media reveal that Clearview AI spent nearly a million dollars in a bid to purchase "690 million arrest records and 390 million arrest photos" from all 50 states from an intelligence firm. The contract further describes the records as including current and former home addresses, dates of birth, arrest photos, social security and cell phone numbers, and email addresses. Clearview attempted to purchase this data from Investigative Consultant, Inc. (ICI) which billed itself as an intelligence company with access to tens of thousands of databases and the ability to create unique data streams for its clients. The contract was signed in mid-2019, at a time when Clearview AI was quietly collecting billions of photos off the internet and was relatively unknown at the time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Updates Advanced Performance Extensions &quot;APX&quot; Code For The Linux Kernel</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-APX-Update-Linux-Kernel</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 00:59:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In addition to Intel software engineers this week being busy doing a late restructuring of AVX10 support in moving away from possible 256-bit maximum vector register size (a great move and still so excited to see this materialize!), there are also Intel engineers continuing work on enabling Advanced Performance Extensions (APX) on the Linux kernel side...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rise &amp; Fall of The Moors in Spain</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-rise-fall-of-the-moors-in-spain</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67d99072f48da98092125d1a/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=kmEiEU-iokXHd9ZaMUQDmi9xrCJdD-DNKaS7Q__18DQ" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 711 an Arab and Berber army crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and invaded the Iberian Peninsula.

There was a part of me--a very naive part, mind you--that thought it might be a bit fun to see how long I could go without making mention of the game in this review as a sort of challenge for myself. Clearly, I have already failed.However, the context in which InZoi exists matters. Whereas the world is filled with cozy games, life sims, and plenty of other titles that reside somewhere between the two, extremely few play quite like The Sims. It goes without saying that Maxis created something extremely special back in 2000--something so creative, charming, innovative, and intricately designed that seemingly no other game studio has even attempted to put an end to its quarter-century long reign over the life-sim genre. There is no denying that the franchise's reputation has taken some hits over the years, primarily due to its perceived stagnation and parent company EA's predatory monetization tactics. As this discontent has grown, so too has the number of people looking for a viable competitor. And now, thanks to InZoi, we have a fresh-faced and utterly gorgeous new challenger.Considering its good looks were among the first of many things that made InZoi such a highly anticipated title, I'll start by saying that it is just as mind-blowing to look at as it seems. From its UI to its city streets to its pouty-lipped, pop star-esque characters, everything about InZoi is visually remarkable. Vast amounts of customization options, an immersive and ever-changing open world, and an intense focus on making things feel true-to-life yet just more grand further polish this gem. And I was relieved that, despite all its luster, the game ran perfectly fine on my less-than-great gaming PC (AMD Ryzen 5 3600/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super). And yet, I was ultimately forced to reckon with the fact that, in my 20 or so hours with InZoi, I missed out on something incredibly important: having fun. Though InZoi is impressive, immersive, and brimming with potential, in its current state there is a sterility and lifelessness that is hard to move past. This paired with stale gameplay ultimately made InZoi a game I desperately to enjoy, but seldom did.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Interesting Linux 6.14 Features From NTSYNC To AMD Ryzen AI &amp; Rust Abstractions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-Features-Reminder</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:28:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Barring any last minute issues or hesitation by Linus Torvalds, the Linux 6.14 kernel is aiming for releasing as stable this coming Sunday on 23 March.

I wanted to share my analytics app with you.This project came from requirements to track certain very frequent events. I found that the cost to do it on a regular analytics product was much more than i was willing to pay. Secondly, I also wanted to use as few resources as possible. So I thought it may be a good idea to create something that may be useful for myself (and hopefully others).I have been able to track a great number of events with this using ~20 MB of storage and memory which is incredible. I have been really impressed by golang as a language and as an ecosystem and would love to work more in this language going forward.Some Highlights: 
1. No dependencies 
2. CLI based management 
3. Web based UI (and the server to serve it) included in the program. 
4. 20 MB install size.   
5. 20 MB memory use while running.  
6. Minimal storage requirements because it aggregates events.This can be a great fit for anyone who wants to have a lightweight minimal analytics for internal events.I am looking forward to your comments and feedback.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SOGCast 037: Jim Suber — Brother of SOG MIA Recon Green Beret&apos;s Decades of Pain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y05l6kD_Sc</link><author>Jocko Podcast</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2Y05l6kD_Sc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 19:27:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqcY4CAuBFNFho6JgygCnA">Jocko Podcast</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More from J.

            Let’s get real for a minute: the tech industry loves to sell us on the myth of the "dream
            job."
            You
            know
            the
            pitch - beanbags in the office, free kombucha on tap, and "Agile" processes that are supposed to
            make
            everything
            more flexible, more efficient. But the reality? It’s a meat grinder that chews up developers,
            sysadmins,
            and
            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.
        
            We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,
            demanding
            80
            hour weeks under the guise of "passion." And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the
            constant
            threat
            of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and
            unless we
            start
            organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.
        
            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In
            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say
            it’s
            about
            "responding to change over following a plan," but let’s be honest - it’s about dangling
            more
            carrots
            and keeping
            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we’re the ones paying the
            price.

        
            And then there’s burnout. We’re in an industry where burnout isn’t just common -
            it’s
            expected. If you’re not
            pulling all-nighters, you’re "not committed." If you’re not answering Slack messages at
            midnight,
            you’re "not a
            team player." This culture is toxic, and it’s only getting worse. The relentless churn of
            projects,
            the
            constant
            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And
            what’s
            the industry’s solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.
        
            Let’s talk about job security - because there isn’t any. The tech industry loves to hype itself
            as a
            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it’s a meat market. As
            soon
            as
            you’re not "on the cutting edge," you’re out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy
            bullshit -
            it’s all
            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that
            we’ll
            have a
            job next week, next month, or next year.
        
            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us
            disposable. Permanent employment? That’s for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when
            they
            can
            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don’t get me started on those
            non-compete
            clauses
            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.
        
            And let’s not forget the ethical side of this equation. We’re being asked to build the future,
            to
            develop AI,
            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?
            How
            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data
            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don’t have the power to say no?
        
            That’s the kicker. We’re the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it’s
            built. We don’t get
            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we’re isolated, as long as
            we’re afraid
            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.
        
            This industry isn’t going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren’t going to suddenly
            grow a
            conscience,
            and they aren’t going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from
            organizing,
            from
            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.
        
            Unionizing isn’t just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).
            It’s
            about taking
            back some control. It’s about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we’re
            treated.
            It’s about
            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.
        
            And don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?
            They’re
            showing us it can
            be done. They’re standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,
            "Enough." We
            need
            more of
            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are
            profiting off our sweat and tears.
        
            Hackers, we’ve always been about more than just code. We’ve been about freedom - freedom of
            information, freedom
            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It’s about taking the hacker ethos into the
            workplace,
            about
            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.
         Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to
                organizing is
                realizing you’re not alone.
            Support Existing Efforts: If you’re in a company where union efforts are already
                underway, get
                involved.
                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.
             We’re hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to
                organize without
                being
                detected. Let’s use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the
                powers that
                be. Let’s make sure that any union platform we build isn’t
                just about wages and
                hours, but
                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we’re building and how it’s used.
            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don’t do something soon, we’re going to get run
            over. The
            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it’s all going to keep getting worse unless we take a
            stand.
            Unionizing isn’t just a nice idea - it’s a necessity.
        
            So let’s do what hackers do best: let’s disrupt. Let’s take the tools they’ve given
            us, the skills we’ve
            honed, and use them to build something better. Let’s unionize. Let’s take back our industry,
            take back our
            jobs, and take back our futures.
        
            The future of tech is being written right now, and it’s up to us to decide what kind of story it will
            be.
            Let’s make it a story we can be proud of.

But unlike those western Maghreb hunter-gatherers — whose ancestry was largely replaced by European farmers probably arriving through the Strait of Gibraltar — local ancestry persisted in Tunisia and Algeria long after the arrival of farmers from Europe and the Middle East.This fits with evidence that people in the eastern Maghreb continued to hunt local animals such as land snails and forage wild plants, even while farming imported sheep, goats and cattle. Agriculture didn’t take off in the region until much later. Maybe, says Reich, the resilience of local ancestry is related to resistance to farming practices.The genome of a man from a Tunisian site called Djebba held a major surprise: about 6% of his DNA could be traced back to European hunter-gatherers. The researchers estimate that his Maghrebi ancestors mixed with European hunter-gatherers around 8,500 years ago. There are weaker signs of these encounters in a woman from the site.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Napoleonic Battle Surgery: Amputation &amp; Bullet Removal The Gruesome Reality</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_erxvSB-gds</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_erxvSB-gds?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Historian Dan Snow meets Kevin Goodman to learn how battlefield surgery progresses in the 18th and 19th centuries through the Napoleonic War, American Civil War and American Indian Wars.

I’m Tony, co-founder of Inngest. I wanted to share AgentKit, our Typescript multi-agent library we’ve been cooking and testing with some early users in prod for months.Although  OpenAI’s Agents SDK has been launched since, we think an Agent framework should offer more deterministic and flexible routing, work with multiple model providers, embrace MCP (for rich tooling), and support the unstoppable and growing community of TypeScript AI developers by enabling a smooth transition to production use cases.This is why we are building AgentKit, and we’re really excited about it for a few reasons:Firstly, it’s simple. We embrace KISS principles brought by Anthropic and HuggingFace by allowing you to gradually add autonomy to your AgentKit program using primitives:- Agents: LLM calls that can be combined with prompts, tools, and MCP native support.- Networks: a simple way to get Agents to collaborate with a shared State, including handoff.- State: combines conversation history with a fully typed state machine, used in routing.- Routers: where the autonomy lives, from code-based to LLM-based (ex: ReAct) orchestrationThe routers are where the magic happens, and allow you to build deterministic, reliable, testable agents.AgentKit routing works as follows: the network calls itself in a loop, inspecting the State to determine which agents to call next using a router.  The returned agent runs, then optionally updates state data using its tools.  On the next loop, the network inspects state data and conversation history, and determines which new agent to run.This fully typed state machine routing allows you to deterministically build agents using any of the effective agent patterns — which means your code is easy to read, edit, understand, and debug.This also makes handoff incredibly easy: you define when agents should hand off to each other using regular code and state (or by calling an LLM in the router for AI-based routing). This is similar to the OpenAI Agents SDK but easier to manage, plan, and build.Then comes the local development and moving to production capabilities.AgentKit is compatible with Inngest’s tooling, meaning that you can test agents using Inngest’s local DevServer, which provides traces, inputs, outputs, replay, tool, and MCP inputs and outputs, and (soon) a step-over debugger so that you can easily understand and visually see what's happening in the agent loop.In production, you can also optionally combine AgentKit with Inngest for fault-tolerant execution.  Each agent’s LLM call is wrapped in a step, and tools can use multiple steps to incorporate things like human-in-the-loop.  This gives you native orchestration, observability, and out-of-the-box scale.You will find the documentation as an example of an AgentKit SWE-bench and multiple Coding Agent examples.It’s fully open-source under the Apache 2 license.If you want to get started:- npm: npm i @inngest/agent-kitWe’re excited to finally launch AgentKit; let us know what you think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the &apos;Woman, Life, Freedom&apos; protest movement in Iran | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKaZZcHtgU</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oAKaZZcHtgU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the "Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.

She had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: "Woman, Life, Freedom”.

Iranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.

For example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.

Brother Pháp Dung discusses the life and teachings of Vietnamese Zen master, peace activist, poet, and author Thich Nhat Hanh.

In January 2022, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Zen master, peace activist, poet, and author passed away. He was the founder of the International Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called him “an Apostle of peace and nonviolence” when nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thousands of people came out for his funeral.   

Brother Pháp Dung is making his second appearance on the show to talk about Thich Nhat Hanh. If you missed it last time he was on, Brother Pháp Dung has an incredible personal story. He was born in Vietnam in 1969 and came to the US at the age of nine. He worked as an architect/designer for four years before becoming a monk. He was very close personally with Thich Nhat Hanh, who he refers to as “Thây,” or teacher, and is now a Dharma teacher himself in Thich Nhat Hanh’s Plum Village tradition.

This episode was first released in March 2022.

DESCRIPTION
Sarah Wells and Anne Currie dive into “The Cloud Native Attitude” and uncover why it’s more than just using cloud infrastructure. It’s about breaking bottlenecks, embracing rapid change, and aligning the entire organization.

Anne reflects on how Kubernetes has risen since the book’s first edition, but the core principles remain. They discuss why CI/CD is key, how cloud native supports sustainability, and why true transformation demands more than just a lift-and-shift. The conversation wraps up with practical advice on identifying real bottlenecks and securing buy-in for a successful cloud native journey.

It turns out that it's the default loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI scrapers that are causing outages.By now, it should be pretty clear that this is no coincidence. AI scrapers are getting more and more aggressive, and - since FOSS software relies on public collaboration, whereas private companies don't have that requirement - this is putting some extra burden on Open Source communities.So let's try to get more details – going back to Drew's blogpost. According to Drew, LLM crawlers don't respect robots.txt requirements and include expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in your repository. They do so using random User-Agents from tens of thousands of IP addresses, each one making no more than one HTTP request, trying to blend in with user traffic.Due to this, it's hard to come off with a good set of mitigations. Drew says that several high-priority tasks have been delayed for weeks or months due to these interruptions, users have been occasionally affected (because it's hard to distinguish bots and humans), and - of course - this causes occasional outages of SourceHut.Drew here does not distinguish between which AI companies are more or less respectful of robots.txt files, or more accurate in their user agent reporting; we'll be able to look more into that later.Finally, Drew points out that this is not some isolated issue. He says, All of my sysadmin friends are dealing with the same problems, [and] every time I sit down for beers or dinner to socialize with sysadmin friends it's not long before we're complaining about the bots. [...] The desperation in these conversations is palpable.Which brings me back to yesterday's KDE GitLab issues. According to Ben, part of the KDE sysadmin team, all of the IPs that were performing this DDoS were claiming to be MS Edge, and were due to Chinese AI companies; he mentions that Western LLM operators, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, were at least setting a proper UA - again, more on this later.The solution - for now - was to ban the version of Edge that the bots were claiming to be, though it's hard to believe that this will be a definitive solution; these bots do seem keen on changing user agents to try to blend in as much as possible.Indeed, GNOME has been experiencing issues since a last November; as a temporary solution they had rate-limited non-logged in users from seeing merge requests and commits, which obviously also caused issues for real human guests.The solution the eventually settled to was switching to Anubis. This is a page that presents a challenge to the browser, which then has to spend time doing some math and presenting the solution back to the server. If it's right, you get access to the website.According to the developer, this project is "a bit of a nuclear response, but AI scraper bots scraping so aggressively have forced my hand. I hate that I have to do this, but this is what we get for the modern Internet because bots don't conform to standards like robots.txt, even when they claim to".However, this is also causing user issues. When a lot of people open the link from the same place, it might happen that they get served some higher-difficulty exercise that will take some time to complete; there's one user reporting one minute delay, and another - from his phone - having to wait around two minutes.Why? Well, a GitLab link was pasted in a chatroom! Similarly, the same happened when the Triple Buffering GNOME merge request was posted to Hacker News, and thus received a lot of attention over there. As the developer said, it's a nuclear option for crawlers, but it also has human consequences.Over Mastodon, one GNOME sysadmin, Bart Piotrowski, kindly shared some numbers to let people fully understand the scope of the problem. According to him, in around two hours and a half they received 81k total requests, and out of those only 3% passed Anubi's proof of work, hinting at 97% of the traffic being bots – an insane number!That said, at least  worked. Other organizations are having a harder time dealing with these scrapers.As an example, here's Jonathan Corbet, who runs the FOSS news source LWN, warns users that the website might be "occasionally sluggish"… due to DDoS from AI scraper bots. He claims that "only a small fraction of our traffic is serving actual human readers", and at some point, the bots "decides to hit us from hundreds of IP addresses at once. [..] They don't identify themselves as bots, and robots.txt is the only thing they don't read off the site".Many expressed solidarity, including Kevin Fenzi, sysadmin for the Fedora project. They've also been having issues with AI scrapers: firstly, one month ago they had to fight to get pagure.io to stay alive:However, things got  over time, so they had to block a bunch of subnets, which has also impacted many real users. Out of desperation, at one point Kevin decided to ban the entire country of Brazil to get things to work again; to my understanding, this ban is still in effect, and it's not so clear where a longer-term solution might be found.And, as Neal Gompa points out, even this blocking an entire country only gets you so far, and apparently the Fedora infrastructure has been "regularly down for weeks" because of AI scrapers.Another project that's been hit by this issue  is Inkscape. According to Martin Owens, it's not "the usual Chinese DDoS from last year, but from a pile of companies that started ignoring our spider conf and started spoofing their browser info. I now have a Prodigius block list. If you happen to work for a big company doing AI, you may not get our website anymore".And, well, Martin is not the only developer who has built a "prodigious block list". Even BigGrizzly from Frama software was flooded by a bad LLM crawler, and built a list of 460K IPs with spoofed user agents to ban; he's offering to share the list around.One more comprehensive attempt at this is the "ai.robots.txt" project, an open list of web crawlers associated with AI companies. They offer a robots.txt that implements the Robots Exclusion Protocol and a .htaccess file that will return an error page when getting a request from any AI crawler in their list.We can get some more numbers about the crawlers if we go a few months back. Here's a post by Dennis Schubert about the Diaspora (an Open Source decentralized social network) infrastructure, where he says that "looking at the traffic logs made him impressively angry".In the blogpost, he claims that one fourth of his entire web traffic is due to bots with an OpenAI user agent, 15% is due to Amazon, 4.3% is due to Anthropic, and so on. Overall, we're talking about 70% of the entire requests being from AI companies.they don’t just crawl a page once and then move on. Oh, no, they come back every 6 hours because lol why not. They also don’t give a single flying fuck about , because why should they. [...] If you try to rate-limit them, they’ll just switch to other IPs all the time. If you try to block them by User Agent string, they’ll just switch to a non-bot UA string (no, really). This is literally a DDoS on the entire internet.A similar number is given by the Read the Docs project. In a blogpost called, "AI crawlers need to be more respectful", they claim that blocking  AI crawlers immediately decreased their traffic by 75%, going from 800GB/day to 200GB/day. This made the project save up around $1500 a month.The rest of the article is pretty impressive too; they talk about crawlers downloading tens of terabytes of data within a few days, or more. It's hard to block them entirely, since they use various different IPs.I do wonder how much of this is scraping for training data, and how much instead is the "search" function that most LLMs provide; nonetheless, according to Schubert, "normal" crawlers such as Google's and Bing's only add up to a fraction of a single percentage point, which hints at the fact that other companies are indeed abusing their web powers.But it's not just scrapers, or I would've titled this "AI scrapers", not "AI companies". Another issue that Open Source community have been fighting with is AI-generated bug reports, as an example.This was first reported by Daniel Stenberg of the Curl project, in a blogpost titled "The I in LLM stands for Intelligence". Curl offers a bug bounty project, but lately, they've noticed that many bug reports are generated by AI. These look credible and take up a lot of developer time to check, but they also contain the typical hallucinations you'd expect from AIs. It's pretty crazy to have to go through your own code because a bug report confidently tells you there's some critical security issue to fix, and … not finding it, because the whole issue is just AI hallucination.A similar issue was reported by Seth Larson, who's on the security report triage team for CPython, pip, urllib3, Requests, and more. He says,Recently I've noticed an uptick in extremely low-quality, spammy, and LLM-hallucinated security reports to open source projects. The issue is in the age of LLMs, these reports appear at first-glance to be potentially legitimate and thus require time to refute.This is a pretty big issue. As he points out, responding to security reports is expensive, and responding to invented but credible bug reports causes some significant additional burden on maintainers, which might drive them out of the Open Source world.The article ends with a request: please, do not use AI or LLM systems for detecting vulnerabilities. He says, "These systems today cannot understand code, finding security vulnerabilities requires understanding code AND understanding human-level concepts like intent, common usage, and context.".Again, I want to point out that these issues impact disproportionately on the FOSS world; not only do Open Source projects often have less resources compared to commercial products, but - being community-driven projects - much more of their infrastructure is public and thus susceptible to both crawlers and AI-generated bug reports or issues. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Frontend Treadmill</title><link>https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/</link><author>Kerrick</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 12:25:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of frontend teams are very convinced that rewriting their frontend will lead to the promised land. And I am the bearer of bad tidings.If you are building a product that you hope has longevity, your frontend framework is the least interesting technical decision for you to make. And all of the time you spend arguing about it is wasted energy.If your product is still around in 5 years, you’re doing great and you should feel successful. But guess what? Whatever framework you choose will be obsolete in 5 years. That’s just how the frontend community has been operating, and I don’t expect it to change soon. Even the popular frameworks that are still around are completely different. Because change is the name of the game. So they’re gonna rewrite their shit too and just give it a new version number.Product teams that are smart are getting off the treadmill. Whatever framework you currently have, start investing in getting to know it deeply. Learn the tools until they are not an impediment to your progress. That’s the only option. Replacing it with a shiny new tool is a trap.I also wanna give a piece of candid advice to engineers who are searching for jobs. If you feel strongly about what framework you want to use, please make that a criteria for your job search. Please stop walking into teams and derailing everything by trying to convince them to switch from framework X to your framework of choice. It’s really annoying and tremendously costly.I always have to start with the cynical take. It’s just how I am. But I do want to talk about what I think should be happening instead.Companies that want to reduce the cost of their frontend tech becoming obsoleted so often should be looking to get back to fundamentals. Your teams should be working closer to the web platform with a lot less complex abstractions. We need to relearn what the web is capable of and go back to that.Let’s be clear, I’m not suggesting this is strictly better and the answer to all of your problems. I’m suggesting this as an intentional business tradeoff that I think provides more value and is less costly in the long run. I believe if you stick closer to core web technologies, you’ll be better able to hire capable engineers in the future without them convincing you they can’t do work without rewriting millions of lines of code.And if you’re an engineer, you will be able to retain much higher market value over time if you dig into and understand core web technologies. I was here before react, and I’ll be here after it dies. You may trade some job marketability today. But it does a lot more for career longevity than trying to learn every new thing that gets popular. And you see how quickly they discarded us when the market turned anyway. Knowing certain tech won’t save you from those realities.I couldn’t speak this candidly about this stuff when I held a management role. People can’t help but question my motivations and whatever agenda I may be pushing. Either that or I get into a lot of trouble with my internal team because they think I’m talking about them. But this is just what I’ve seen play out after doing this for 20+ years. And I feel like we need to be able to speak plainly.This has been brewing in my head for a long time. The frontend ecosystem is kind of broken right now. And it’s frustrating to me for a few different reasons. New developers are having an extremely hard time learning enough skills to be gainfully employed. They are drowning in this complex garbage and feeling really disheartened. As a result, companies are finding it more difficult to do basic hiring. The bar is so high just to get a regular dev job. And everybody loses.What’s even worse is that I believe a lot of this energy is wasted. People that are learning the current tech ecosystem are absolutely not learning web fundamentals. They are too abstracted away. And when the stack changes again, these folks are going to be at a serious disadvantage when they have to adapt away from what they learned. It’s a deep disservice to people’s professional careers, and it’s going to cause a lot of heartache later.On a more personal note, this is frustrating to me because I think it’s a big part of why we’re seeing the web stagnate so much. I still run into lots of devs who are creative and enthusiastic about building cool things. They just can’t. They are trying and failing because the tools being recommended to them are just not approachable enough. And at the same time, they’re being convinced that learning fundamentals is a waste of time because it’s so different from what everybody is talking about.I guess I want to close by stating my biases. I’m a web guy. I’ve been bullish on the web for 20+ years, and I will continue to be. I think it is an extremely capable and unique platform for delivering software. And it has only gotten better over time while retaining an incredible level of backwards compatibility. The underlying tools we have are dope now. But our current framework layer is working against the grain instead of embracing the platform.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supercharge Exercise Performance &amp; Recovery with Cooling | Huberman Lab Essentials</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5--yogtN6oM</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5--yogtN6oM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 12:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I discuss the critical role of temperature regulation in optimizing athletic and physical performance.

I explain why overheating can hinder performance and endurance and how techniques like palmar cooling can help extend physical effort by aiding temperature regulation. I also highlight how specific body areas, such as the palms and face, are key targets for regulating temperature, allowing heat to dissipate efficiently. Lastly, I discuss how temperature can support training recovery while cautioning that extreme cold, such as ice baths immediately after training, can block adaptations.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes—approximately 30 minutes—focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

In this episode, you are going to learn how to have amazing sex, deeper intimacy, and create real, lasting love. 

If you feel like intimacy with your partner is rare, your desire is low, or that your marriage is even sexless, this conversation is for you. 

Here to deliver the most important sex advice you need to hear is renowned sex therapist and bestselling author, Vanessa Marin.  

Vanessa Marin is a licensed psychotherapist and a sex therapist with over 20 years of clinical experience helping people have healthier, more satisfying sex lives. She is known for her viral, no-shame, straight-to-the-point advice on how to have the best sex of your life. 

This conversation tackles everything you weren’t taught—and probably aren’t talking about—when it comes to sex. Mel also shares openly about her own sex life, difficulties with intimacy, and speaks openly in a way you’ve never heard before.

Whether you are single, in a relationship, or married, this conversation is going to make you think differently about sex and inspire you to prioritize pleasure and connection in bed, no matter your age, relationship status, or gender. 

You’ll learn:
-The real reason you feel disconnected in your sex life
-The two different types of sex drives and why it matters 
-What to do if you’re on your way to a dry bedroom
-What exactly to say if you’re not in the mood when your partner initiates sex

If you feel like you can’t talk about sex, if you can’t ask for what you want, don’t know how to bring it up, are going through a dry spell, or want to have more sex but you’re exhausted, this episode is for you.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#DeskOfTheDay: &quot;girls can&apos;t play the guitar,&quot; Strapless</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7LURW_TpI</link><author>NPR Music</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Bo7LURW_TpI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:56:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A">NPR Music</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's #DeskOfTheDay is "girls can't play the guitar" by @Strapless_band  from Providence, RI.!

There's been a big rework to the Intel CPU model handling within the Linux kernel given that "Family 6" has been in use since the 1990s and moving forward Intel CPUs will appear in Family 19 like Diamond Rapids along with Family 18 as part of the new CPU identification. Thus a lot of Linux kernel checks need to be reconfigured for the multi-family Intel handling. With Linux 6.15 it looks like most of that will be finally wrapped up...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quantum Marketing With Raja Rajamannar Trailer | Premieres March 27</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9q8qONoBtA</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/O9q8qONoBtA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:10:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From social media to AI, advertising has changed dramatically in a short time.

	Tyler Hilton shrugged it off when his 5-year-old daughter, Winnie, became obsessed with a series introduced by a nanny. “Uh, OK … a dog family,” he thought, doubting its appeal. But as the musician and actor became unable to escape listening to  in the background of his Canada home, he soon found himself chuckling, impressed and engrossed.
	“The parents were so relatable and mirrored the parent I wanted to be,” says the star. “They weren’t removed and authoritative, but super-loving, involved and part of the fun — but also exhausted and exasperated sometimes. It was like watching me on screen. Then I got to and went, ‘This is the greatest show ever.’”

	
	The father-of-two’s now hooked on the animated series, was devastated he couldn’t visit immersive experience Bluey’s World Brisbane during his recent Australian tour and has ventured into children’s entertainment himself with an upcoming book, .
	Hilton’s not the only one all-in with . Since its 2018 premiere, the series has amassed a global following that saw special extended episode “The Sign” rack up a record-breaking 10 million views on Disney+ during its first week. The series also became the most-watched show in America in 2024.
	However, it’s the remarkable impact offscreen that has transformed  into a global juggernaut, which has some declaring the pup the Taylor Swift of children’s entertainment. Whether it’s kids talking in Aussie slang, tourism campaigns centered around the cute canines, live shows, merchandise, an upcoming movie or Disney welcoming  into resorts and cruises, the brand — worth an estimated $2 billion — has infiltrated entertainment, culture, education, parenting and travel.
	Created by Australian writer-director Joe Brumm, the Emmy-winning series follows imaginative 6-year-old Blue Heeler puppy Bluey, younger sister Bingo and parents Bandit and Chilli. Inspired by hits like plus his experience parenting two daughters, Brumm wrote a pilot that was developed by Queensland’s Ludo Studio and co-commissioned by ABC and BBC.
	“All the little conflicts or emotional stuff that’s going on is from watching my kids,” Brumm told . “One kid is always doing [something] to another kid, and you talk it through with your wife and friends and you read books — you’re always trying to figure some issue out.”

	
	It only took one seven-minute installment for Australian theater producer and promoter Andrew Kay to jump on board. He became compelled by the episode “Spy Game,” in which Bandit waits for Bingo to finish in the restroom during a park barbecue. “How you going, Bingo? I can feel my sausages burning,” Bandit implores. Bingo replies, “I started just doing a wee, and now it turned into poo.”
	“I’d never seen a children’s show talk about real life like that,” says Kay. “I thought, ‘This is charming, funny and real.’”
	Kay swiftly secured live touring rights and created theater adaptation  which continues touring the world. Taking the show abroad was eye-opening.
	“At Madison Square Garden, there was 20 adults and four children from New Jersey — parents, aunt, grandparents. That’s true of . People want to participate as a family. I’ve done children’s shows where you’d rather put a pin in your eye, but you go because your child loves it. But with , everyone’s thrilled.”
	It may be Bluey’s world, but Bandit and Chilli have largely spawned the series’ intergenerational reach. Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, says the two present a balanced view of parenting young, energetic kids as wonderful and rewarding, but frustrating and exhausting.

	
	“Bandit and Chilli model positive parenting behaviors, such as validating emotions and encouraging problem-solving, while sharing their shortcomings and missteps — validating parents’ worries about their own challenges,” says Dr. Rutledge. “When Bandit and Chilli intervene, it lets Bluey and Bingo feel heard rather than minimized.  
	“In the episode ‘Yoga Ball,’ Chilli helps Bingo develop her ‘big girl bark,’ so she can tell others when the play’s too rough for her. Bandit validates her feelings by making sure he understands how rough is OK. That’s in contrast to responding, ‘You’re fine, we’re just playing,’ which undermines a child’s confidence in expressing their feelings.”
	The show’s bravery in exploring mature topics, like infertility, has also moved parents. Hilton’s been left emotional after episodes about death and loneliness. Dr. Rutledge believes resonating psychologically with different generations has boosted ’s appeal.
	“Episodes that deal with difficult subjects balance age-appropriateness without minimizing the emotions adults may feel,” she says. “Most toddler shows deal with emotions in a superficial way and rarely put them in real-world contexts.”
	Like Bluey, Brumm’s from Queensland and his spotlight on the “Sunshine State” has fueled tourism. As fans began matching show locations with spots like Brisbane’s South Bank, and bloggers began posting -themed guides, visitor interest accelerated.

	
	Tourism and Events Queensland began offering  itineraries, including one by Melanie Zanetti, who voices Chilli. The organization’s 2024 campaign “Queensland is Bluey’s World, For Real Life” proved pivotal, attracting 680,000 Australian and New Zealand visitors.
	“We began to see conversion of tourist interest from the show into visitation to the state,” says TEQ’s Ollie Philpot. “The data shows a tangible increase, particularly from families.” 
	“’s warm, welcoming and has shared our lifestyle with a global audience,” he adds. “It’s also brought our tourism industry together for our biggest campaign in a decade.”
	Bluey’s World Brisbane, produced by Kay, is now expected to inject more than $11.4 million (AUD$18 million) into Queensland’s economy.
	The fun begins en route with airlines like Qantas and Air New Zealand offering  as in-flight entertainment. Once arriving Down Under, it’s hard to miss Bluey and Bingo “CityDog” catamarans escorting fans along Brisbane River.
	Guests are then greeted with “Nearly there!” pavement stickers and handed puppy ears while taken inside, where a gnome declares the best day ever would involve playing with Bluey and Bingo. Kids eagerly help solve clues to find the pair. Along the way there’s mazes, dance sessions, tea parties and characters like Unicorse, who teases, “They’re not here — they didn’t make the cut for my boy band!”

	
	“I don’t think there’s a narrative-driven immersive experience in the world like this,” says Kay, adding that new narratives are in the works so fans can return for different experiences. “Kids feel the excitement of being in the episode.”
	I may have been the only adult without kids at Australia’s hottest new attraction, but in a world that’s as popular among adults as youth, no one bat an eyelid. And while parents were engaged in the 70-minute experience, it was the spellbound awe on children’s faces that make Bluey and Swift comparisons unsurprising.
	So, what do the two superstars have in common?
	“Both Taylor and Bluey can be genuinely enjoyed by parents and kids,” offers Hilton, a longtime pal of Swift. “And there’s a throughline of ‘good’ through both. Neither are cynical, cheap or playing to baser instincts. They both respect the audience and don’t placate.”
	Dr. Rutledge adds there’s nothing wrong with toddlers engaging in  with the same passion Swifties feel.
	“We tend to think of fandom as an adult thing, but it’s not,” she says. “It can have many benefits, including asense of belonging, social support and creative expression. Shared interests create a common ground, sense of community and shared identity — even for toddlers. They help kids feel less isolated and encourage the development of social skills through collaborative play.”’s powerful effect on children is evident in the number of kids picking up Australian accents or slang, like “dunny” for “toilet.” Actor Ryan Gosling told his daughters’ accents are from the show. “Every kid has an Aussie twang now,” he mused. Hilton, who also has an 8-month-old son, Bennett, with director-actress wife Megan Park, adds Winnie’s also picked up a slight accent. “And she calls me ‘mate!’”

	
	Other  fans include Natalie Portman, guest star Lin-Manuel Miranda, Billy Joel (who threw a -themed birthday for his daughter) and Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter, who shared  was “on repeat” after watching with son Odin.
	Meanwhile, the brand has spawned books, podcasts, toys, albums, clothing, homeware, themed hotel rooms, Facebook groups and a mobile game. There’s also Bluey x CAMP, an immersive experience in selected Camp locations.
	Naturally, creators are clamoring to replicate ’s success, but Kay believes it’s a rare phenomenon.
	“I once consulted for a company who thought if they could bring together a mix of The Wiggles and Hi-5, they’d have the new supergroup,” he says. “It lasted two weeks because it wasn’t The Wiggles and wasn’t Hi-5.
	“You can’t manufacture something like this. Joe’s created something extraordinary and when you get to work on it, you treasure that moment because it may never come again.”
	As for fans, the equal number of adults sporting shirts as kids during my visit to Bluey’s World Brisbane is further testament to the inimitable power of .
	“It’s taught me more about parenting than any books I’ve read or professionals whose brains I’ve picked,” notes Hilton, who was inspired by  when endeavoring to make  (out on April 8) entertaining, educational and fun for parents. “Their patience, rules, engagement, love and faults make me think it’s a show for parents masking as a show for kids. It’s reminded me many times what an incredible time in both my life and my kids’ life this is.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Not Everyone Is Convinced by Microsoft&apos;s Topological Qubits</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/topological-qubit</link><author>Dina Genkina</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Nzk5OTY0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTQ2MjM1N30.relj5InkO7V-WrmeZGH1GOKPbkqO06L4Eqxopr3mczE/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft and Nokia are developing a contentious new type of quantum computer]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>fd: A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to &apos;find&apos;</title><link>https://github.com/sharkdp/fd</link><author>tosh</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:44:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;m the Canadian who was detained by ICE for two weeks</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney</link><author>n1b0m</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:21:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[here was no explanation, no warning. One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being sent to an Ice detention center without the chance to talk to a lawyer.I grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of Canada. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries – acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.In my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water – a job that would involve moving to the US.I was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.I started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications – until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer’s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.After a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed “shady” and that my visa hadn’t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn’t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp – one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.I was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.I restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn’t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.Then she said something strange: “You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.”I remember thinking: Why would she say that? Of course I’m not a criminal!She then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn’t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.There was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.They took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.“What are you doing? What is happening?” I asked.“You are being detained.”“I don’t understand. What does that mean? For how long?”That would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: “I don’t know.”They brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn’t take everything with me.“Take everything with me where?” I asked.A woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don’t actually know anyone’s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt’s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.I gave them her phone number.They handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.For two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food. The lights never turned off, we never knew what time it was and no one answered our questions. No one in the cell spoke English, so I either tried to sleep or meditate to keep from having a breakdown. I didn’t trust the food, so I fasted, assuming I wouldn’t be there long.On the third day, I was finally allowed to make a phone call. I called Britt and told her that I didn’t understand what was happening, that no one would tell me when I was going home, and that she was my only contact.They gave me a stack of paperwork to sign and told me I was being given a five-year ban unless I applied for re-entry through the consulate. The officer also said it didn’t matter whether I signed the papers or not; it was happening regardless.I was so delirious that I just signed. I told them I would pay for my flight home and asked when I could leave.Then they moved me to another cell – this time with no mat or blanket. I sat on the freezing cement floor for hours. That’s when I realized they were processing me into real jail: the Otay Mesa Detention Center.I was told to shower, given a jail uniform, fingerprinted and interviewed. I begged for information.“How long will I be here?”“I don’t know your case,” the man said. “Could be days. Could be weeks. But I’m telling you right now – you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.”I felt like I was going to throw up.I was taken to the nurse’s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: “Do you believe in God?”I told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.“I believe God brought you here for a reason,” she said. “I know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.”At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.I felt like I had been sent an angel.I was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.The best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.For the first day, I didn’t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.Eventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: “No fighting.”“I’m a lover, not a fighter,” I joked. He laughed.I asked if there had ever been a fight here.“In this unit? No,” he said. “No one in this unit has a criminal record.”That’s when I started meeting the other women.That’s when I started hearing their stories.And that’s when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.There were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas – often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.If someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn’t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.The real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.I met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn’t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.I met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.Another woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn’t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?One woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn’t be deported because Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees. She didn’t know when she was getting out.There was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master’s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.There were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman’s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.That night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers – prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn’t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.Then, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.At 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.“Pack your bag. You’re leaving.”I jolted upright. “I get to go home?”The officer shrugged. “I don’t know where you’re going.”Of course. No one ever knew anything.I grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren’t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term “transferred”.For many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.I had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.Our next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.When we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting – and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.We sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.The look on her face – pure love, relief and longing – was something I’ll never forget.We were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.The guard tossed us each a blanket: “Find a bed.”There were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn’t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.I kept telling myself: Do not let this break you.Thirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men’s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn’t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.Everything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn’t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.I tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn’t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO’s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.Through him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.She started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn’t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.We were all in this together.With nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends – women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.Through them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.One woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.Many of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn’t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.Some believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.Women were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.It felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.We were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other’s hope alive.I got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.Almost immediately after, I was told I was being released.My Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn’t known I would pay for my own flight home.From the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.To put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.Imagine what this system is like for every other person in there.A small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am – one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn’t have to walk through the airport in chains.To my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.I asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.“Yes,” one of them said with a grin. “But you better not run.”“Yeah,” the other added. “Or we’ll have to tackle you in the airport. That’ll really make the headlines.”I laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn’t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. “But don’t worry,” I joked. “You two get five stars.”When I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.It was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.The reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It’s a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.This is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there – someone with the power to change any of this – can help do something.The strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.Even in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel AVX10 Drops Optional 512-bit: No AVX10 256-bit Only E-Cores In The Future</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-AVX10-Drops-256-Bit</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:48:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Intel updated their AVX10 whitepaper and associated open-source compiler patches around this next Advanced Vector Extensions standard...

Cordae has called a few places home during his 27 years, but he's always repped the DMV as an emcee. "This is a hometown show for me, so I'm expecting a biased amount of love from y'all!" Home-court advantage never hurts at the Tiny Desk, but Cordae had a few more tricks up his sleeve. He rolled in deep with a host of musicians and singers, some from the D.C. area and all rocking vintage graphic t-shirts featuring artists that have inspired the rapper. Cordae's meticulous approach to music was evident, and the band was on point by the time soundcheck started.

Cordae has always shined as a masterful storyteller. On The Crossroads, he graduates from origin and neighborhood tales to the adjustment of newfound fame and fatherhood — most of this set comes from that album. But he does take us back to his early days on "06 dreamin," a song about his mother's aspirations as a singer that samples one of her original recordings. In a rare and sweet Tiny Desk moment, he shares his big break and brings his mom, Jennifer Dunston, up to sing with him.

He's a man whose name is synonymous with absolute power, the epitome of ruthless ambition, his story is one of both triumph and unspeakable cruelty. A man whose brutality matched any of the Axis leaders....who worked with Hitler….yet in the end ...aligned himself with the Allies. As a result, he came out of the war on top and shaped the world order for the subsequent 50 years. Even today his shadow falls over the events we're seeing on the evening news.In this episode of 'The Leaders' Dan is joined by Professor of Strategic Studies at the University of St Andrews, Phillips O'Brien and historian Simon Sebag Montefiore to examine the rise of Stalin's totalitarian power and the way he manipulated everyone on both sides to reach his strategic aims. Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal PatmorePhillip's book 'The Strategists' is available now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We COULD have had an American Super Duper Collider 😔🦅</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10kuoD7xyAU</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/10kuoD7xyAU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 00:13:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

In a way, they are a new type of AI PC architecture specifically built for running neural networks, and five major PC manufacturers will build them.These desktop systems, first previewed as "Project DIGITS" in January, aim to bring AI capabilities to developers, researchers, and data scientists who need to prototype, fine-tune, and run large AI models locally. DGX systems can serve as standalone desktop AI labs or "bridge systems" that allow AI developers to move their models from desktops to DGX Cloud or any AI cloud infrastructure with few code changes.Huang explained the rationale behind these new products in a news release, saying, "AI has transformed every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason a new class of computers would emerge—designed for AI-native developers and to run AI-native applications."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia announces “Rubin Ultra” and “Feynman” AI chips for 2027 and 2028</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-rubin-ultra-and-feynman-ai-chips-for-2027-and-2028/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nvidia_chip_hero_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:10:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday at Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference in San Jose, California, CEO Jensen Huang revealed several new AI-accelerating GPUs the company plans to release over the coming months and years.

           By March 18, 2025If all goes according to plan, the Ubuntu project will soon be
replacing many of the traditional GNU utilities with implementations
written in Rust, such as those created by the uutils project, which we covered in
February. Wholesale replacement of core utilities at the heart of a
Linux distribution is no small matter, which is why Canonical's VP of
engineering, Jon Seager, has released . It
is a command-line utility that helps users easily enable or disable
the Rust-based utilities to test their suitability. Seager is calling
for help with testing and for users to provide feedback with their
experiences ahead of a possible switch for Ubuntu 25.10, an interim release
scheduled for October 2025. So far, responses from the Ubuntu
community seem positive if slightly skeptical of such a major
change.Ubuntu celebrated 20 years since its first release in
2024 last year. Seager reflected on that milestone and published
his vision for the next 20 years of Ubuntu in February. One of his
themes for the future is modernization, calling on the project to
constantly assess the foundations of the distribution against the
needs of its users:
We should look deeply at the tools we ship with Ubuntu by default -
selecting for tools that have resilience, performance and
maintainability at their core. There are countless examples in the
open source community of tools being re-engineered, and re-imagined
using tools and practices that have only relatively recently become
available. Some of my personal favourites include command-line
utilities such as eza, bat, and helix, the new ghostty terminal emulator, and more
foundational projects such as the uutils rewrite of 
coreutils in Rust. Each
of these projects are at varying levels of maturity, but have
demonstrated a vision for a more modern Unix-like experience that
emphasizes resilience, performance and usability.
On March 12, Seager published a a follow-up to introduce his plan to start
adopting some of the tools as defaults—with an eye to having
them in place for the next Ubuntu long-term support (LTS) release,
26.04. The rationale for the switch is primarily "the
enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust
ports". He cited a blog
post by Rust
core developer Niko Matsakis. The post, in a nutshell, is about
Matsakis's vision for using Rust to write (or rewrite) foundational
software; that is, "the software that underlies everything
else".Those who have been following the continuing debates and
discussions about using Rust will find familiar themes in
Matsakis's arguments in its favor: Rust provides the performance of
C/C++ without demanding perfection from developers, it
provides reliability, and it makes developers more productive regardless
of experience level. Its reliability makes it particularly suitable
for foundational software because "when foundations fail,
everything on top fails also". Given Ubuntu's widespread
adoption, Seager wrote, "it behooves us to be absolutely certain
we're shipping the most resilient and trustworthy software we
can".Seager also thinks that embracing Rust will help meet another of
his goals for Ubuntu, increasing the number of contributors. Not
because Rust is necessarily easier to use than C, but because it
provides a framework that makes it harder for contributors to commit
potentially unsafe code. Presumably, though it was unsaid, that would
make Rust a more attractive language for those interested in
contributing but not interested in programming in C for whatever reason.The abstract possibility that Rust utilities would be better, or
even feasible, for Ubuntu is no substitute for hands-on
experience. To that end, Seager created  as a way to quickly
swap in (and out) Rust utilities in place of the traditional
counterparts with relatively low risk. He released the first version, 1.0.0,
on March 7. It is available under the Apache 2.0 license
and, as one might expect, written in Rust.The project is not yet packaged for Ubuntu, nor does Seager have a
personal package
archive (PPA) set up for users to install  with
APT. There are binary releases
on GitHub, or users can install the tool using :    $ cargo install --git https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr
The binary releases may be the easiest way to get started, as  requires the 
function in the  module,
but  was added in Rust 1.81.0
(released in September 2024) while the Rust version in
Ubuntu 24.10 is still at 1.80.1. I used
 to install the most recent stable version of Rust, and
then used  to install .The  utility calls a set of utilities that can be
independently replaced an "experiment". Experiments are Rust modules
that define the packages to be installed (or removed) and handle
renaming of the utilities to enable or disable use of the Rust
versions. The current set
of experiments include 
replacing GNU coreutils, findutils, or diffutils with the uutils 
coreutils, findutils, or diffutils, as well as
replacing traditional  with the Rust-based .For instance, to try out  a user would run this
command:    # oxidizr enable --experiments sudo-rs
That will install the  package from the Ubuntu
package repository, back up the  binary, and create a
 symbolic link that targets the Rust binary
(). To enable all experiments, a user
would use the  target instead:

    # oxidizr enable --experiments --all
Finally, to revert the system to the traditional utilities and
remove the replacement packages from the system:



According to
Seager,  works on all versions of Ubuntu after
24.04 LTS, but the uutils diffutils experiment is only supported
on Ubuntu 24.10 or later. He did urge users to start testing on a
virtual machine or other machine that is not their production
workstation or server for safety's sake. Seager reported that he
hasn't had many problems, but he has run into one incompatibility:
the uutils , , and  replacements don't support
the  flag yet, which is used to set the SELinux context
of a file or (in the case of ) print a file's security
context.In my brief testing, I did not run into any problems with the
uutils versions of the utilities or the changes  made
to the system in order to swap them in. However, I did note that
 does not make any changes to the system's man
pages. Even when the GNU utilities have been replaced with the uutils
versions, the GNU man pages are left in place, so ""
still displays the GNU version. It would be good to switch the man
pages too in order to expose users to any gaps in the uutils
documentation as well as the utilities themselves.Fern Dziadulewicz asked
if the move toward uutils meant that "Ubuntu is actually kind of
heading towards GNUlessness", as with some other Linux
distributions that shy away from GNU components. Seager responded
that people should not read too much into the change:This is not symbolic of any pointed move away from GNU components -
it's literally just about replacing coreutils with a more modern
equivalent.Sure, the license is different, and it's a consideration, but it's
by no means a driver in the decision making.That response did not satisfy Joseph Erdosy, who wrote
that he would migrate to Fedora or Rocky Linux if Ubuntu goes through
with the change. He said that he liked Rust and the idea of better,
memory-safe alternatives, but that he was unhappy that the biggest
"oxidized" project was an MIT-licensed rewrite of GPL-licensed code.
This decision seems to align with a broader trend of companies
deprecating GPL software in favour of more permissively licensed
alternatives, often under the guise of "modernization." However, the
real-world impact is clear: free software is increasingly co-opted
into proprietary ecosystems, weakening the principles that made Linux
successful.
A few other users quickly agreed with Erdosy, then Ian Weisser announced
that he was putting 
the topic into "Slow Mode" to "prevent piling-on until the
developers have a chance to respond and keep this topic
constructive". Shortly after, Seager responded
that he did not agree that this potential move posed a threat to
Ubuntu, or its community. He reiterated that it was not
indicative of a political agenda or wider move away from GPL'ed
software, and said that most of Canonical's own software is and would
continue to be GPL'ed.Ubuntu is a collection of software that we curate to build a
distribution. It's a project dedicated to shipping the latest, and
best open source we can find. There is no evidence of foul play, bad
practice or poor intentions from the uutils maintainers - they're a
thoughtful, dedicated community who are building their own software,
and even contributing back to GNU coreutils in some cases. They are
achieving things I think we should aspire to with Ubuntu in the coming
years, and I remain committed to giving this a chance at success -
noting that we and others will need to work closely with them to
resolve issues with locales, selinux support and other issues.If the current situation changes and we believe that the interests
of the uutils project are no longer aligned with those of Ubuntu, we
can change the coreutils package we choose to ship with Ubuntu.Sergey Davidoff wondered
why the Debian
alternatives system, which is used to designate default
applications when multiple programs with the same function are
installed, was not sufficient for experimenting with Rust
utilities. Julian Andres Klode replied
that the alternatives system would not be suitable because the
existing package would need to cooperate. He also responded to
another user, "rain", who had floated
the idea
of allowing users to switch out individual commands. Klode said that
it was a bad idea to allow users to select between Rust and non-Rust
implementations on a per-command level, as it would make the resulting
systems hard to support.Liam Proven asked
about support on versions of Ubuntu for architectures other than
x86_64 and Arm, such as s390 and ppc64le, since "the LLVM Rust
toolchain is still a little immature and code generation for other
architectures is lacking". Uutils project founder and Ubuntu
developer Sylvestre Ledru asked
if Proven had any bug reports to share, since Firefox had been using
the LLVM Rust toolchain to ship Firefox on those architectures for
years. He pointed out that uutils had been successfully building on Debian and
Ubuntu with those architectures as targets for a few years as well.Seager said that he had met with Ledru to discuss the idea of
making uutils coreutils the default in Ubuntu 25.10, and Ledru
felt that the project was ready for that level of exposure. Now it is
just a matter of specifics, he said, and the Ubuntu Foundations team
is already working up a plan to implement this in the next release
cycle. He did acknowledge that there was a need for caution and was open to
the possibility that he would need to "scale back on the
ambition" if making the switch meant compromising stability or
reliability in an Ubuntu LTS release. If the switch doesn't work
out, it should be easy enough to revert in time for next year's LTS release.To date, Ubuntu seems to be the first major Linux distribution that
has seriously considered a switch to uutils. If Ubuntu 25.10
ships with uutils coreutils, it will be a significant win for the
uutils project that grants exposure to a much larger user base than it
has enjoyed so far. The "oxidize Ubuntu" experiment has the
potential to accelerate Rust's adoption and inspire further attempts
to replace C-based utilities with Rust, or it might have a chilling
effect if Ubuntu runs into serious problems. Either way, the project
should be instructive for the larger community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>U.S. Taiwan Rep on a Thinning ‘Silicon Shield,’ Trump, TSMC and More | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJd5a10WESA</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WJd5a10WESA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:28:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Taiwan has long benefited from a “Silicon Shield” — where their dominance in advanced computer chip manufacturing has given countries, like the U.S., a vested interest in their defense from mainland China.

While social media has helped tourism boom and brought prosperity to the region, it also poses a threat to the landscape and its unique historical heritage.

Cappadocia draws more than four million tourists every year. The region in Turkey is famous for its extraordinary "fairy chimneys" - carved-out boulders, some of which are still inhabited. This wonderland became a UNESCO World Heritage Site decades ago.
Every day, hot air balloons carrying tourists drift across valleys dotted with "fairy chimneys." The rock formations, the hot air balloons, the sunrise - the setting couldn't be more instagrammable.
Mustafa Köse knows exactly how to get the perfect shot that tourists want for their social media posts. "Cultural tourism is dead," the photographer says - all people want now is something to show off with on Instagram. It's a development he struggles with, even though he makes a decent living giving the tourists what they want. 
Zehra Demircan took over her father's "cave hotel" a couple of years ago. He did his best to preserve the family's "fairy chimneys" in their original state so that the accommodation still provides an authentic glimpse of Cappadocia. Zehra Demircan is following suit, modernizing the hotel as carefully as possible. Like Mustafa Köse, she sometimes feels conflicted about her visitors. "We had a group here who didn't visit anything for the entire week," she says. "The whole time, they just took photos for social media."
Local activist Mükremin Tokmak has been fighting for years against the destruction of this unique landscape. He was appalled by the construction of a highway cutting through the historical region, paving the way for even more tourism. He documents the effects of the construction work on the valleys and the old churches that stood here. He hasn't given up hope that tourism can be held in check.

The wound that had once marred her face was mostly gone, with only a thin, barely discernible scar left behind. Naoe's face slowly heals over the course of Shadows' story and the changing of the in-game seasons, providing a visual metaphor for the game's thematic journey through the ugliness of revenge, the healing process of forgiveness and moving beyond tragedy with enough time and support. It's a story that has incredible moments between Naoe and fellow protagonist Yasuke but largely feels listless during its muddled second act. And although Naoe's shinobi fantasy is the best Assassin's Creed has been in ages and remains fun to play for the entire game, it makes Yasuke's samurai gameplay feel subpar in comparison.Naoe feels like the intended protagonist of Shadows. Save for a brief hour as Yasuke, the first 12 or so hours are spent solely playing as the shinobi. Even once Yasuke returns to the story, it's in service to Naoe's goal to kill a dozen masked individuals and steal back a mysterious box that she has to recover.But even ignoring his narrative shortcomings as a secondary protagonist, Yasuke is not fun to play. Assassin's Creed has never been a series where its individual gameplay components have surpassed those in other games. Its combat has never been as good as what's available in other action games, other titles have stronger parkour mechanics, and the series always feels a step behind when it comes to stealth. The best part about Assassin's Creed has always been that it brings those three styles of gameplay together in one cohesive package--a combination you don't often see at the level of quality Ubisoft has managed to achieve with Assassin's Creed. Naoe perfectly embodies that trifecta, even possessing new mechanics that make the stealth part of Assassin's Creed a lot better than recent entries. Yasuke, on the other hand, doesn't. Though he's able to fight, Yasuke cannot use parkour, nor can he really rely on stealth. He's only one-third of Assassin's Creed. Although the idea of making an Assassin's Creed protagonist who solely specializes in open warfare sounds cool, in practice it feels awful because that aspect of the franchise is still not up to snuff with dedicated action games.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple restricts Pebble from being awesome with iPhones</title><link>https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones/</link><author>griffinli</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:23:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[During Pebble v1, I learned how much harder it is to build a great smartwatch experience on iPhone than it is on Android. It sounds like things have actually gotten worse over the last 8 years. I want to set expectations accordingly. We will build a good app for iOS, but be prepared - there is no way for us to support all the functionality that Apple Watch has access to. It’s impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things.Here are the things that are harder or impossible for 3rd party smartwatches (ie non Apple Watches) to do on iPhone:There’s no way for a smartwatch to send text messages or iMessages.You can’t reply to notifications or take ‘actions’ like marking something as done.It’s very difficult to enable other iOS apps to work with Pebble. Basically iOS does not have the concept of ‘interprocess communication’(IPC) like on Android. What we did before was publish an SDK that other apps (like Strava) could integrate to make their own BLE connection to Pebble. It was a clunky quasi-solution that other apps didn’t like, because it was hard to test (among other things)If you (accidentally) close our iOS app, then your watch can’t talk to app or internetImpossible for watch to detect if you are using your phone, so your watch will buzz and display a notification even if you are staring at your iPhoneYou can’t easily side load apps onto an iPhone. That means we have to publish the app on the iPhone appstore. This is a gigantic pain because Apple. Every update comes with the risk that a random app reviewer could make up some BS excuse and block the update.Because of iOS Appstore rules, it would be hard for us to enable 3rd party watchface/app developers to charge for their work (ie we can’t easily make an appstore within our app)Getting a Javascript engine to run in PebbleOS forced us to go through many hoops due to iOS — creating a compiler inside the Pebble iPhone app that in itself needed to be written in (cross-compiled to) JS to work with Apple's restriction on downloadable code can only be JSAs a Pebble watch/app developer, using the iOS app as relay to the watch sucks since the "developer mode" terminates every few minutesAs an aside, back at Pebble, we went to crazy lengths to find a way to let Pebble users to send text messages from Pebble. Our bizdev team did an impressive custom SMS-over-IP deal with AT&T to enable this, but the end result was a pretty rough user experience (messages sent from Pebble didn’t appear in the Messages app on iPhone). - it sounds like the situation has actually . This 2024 class action lawsuit against Apple states that: You must set notifications to display full content previews on your lockscreen for them to also be sent to a 3rd party watch (new restriction added in iOS 13).Apple closed off the ability of smartwatches after Pebble to negotiate with carriers to
provide messaging services, and now requires users to turn off iMessage (disabling iOS’s core messaging platform) if they want to take advantage of such contracts between a third-party smartwatch maker and cellular carriers.Why are things so much harder on iOS?Well, mostly because Apple systematically makes it nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers to build a smartwatch experience comparable to Apple Watch experience.Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that’s what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don’t agree - they’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation. DOJ seems to agree. For now at least…Tim Apple paid $1m to sit near Trump at the inauguration, so who knows how long until Trump tells DOJ to drop the case. There’s also an Apple Watch class-action lawsuit working its way through the system.But we’re going to try anywaysThe problem is that 40% of everyone who signed up on rePebble.com still uses an iPhone. So we’re going to make a damn iOS app. I guess we’re gluttons for punishment. Just understand a few things:Our watch will  appear to have less developed functionality on iOS than Android. This is Apple’s fault, not ours.Some features will appear first on our Android app, and then eventually we’ll add them to the iOS app. This is because the majority of our development team uses Android phones, and generally we’re building things for ourselves, so naturally Android comes first.I don’t want to see any tweets or blog posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to .Apple will never change their ways unless you, the Pebble-curious iPhone user, complain loudly or switch to Android. Which is also hard because Apple tries it’s best to lock you into their platform.Are you an iPhone user who wants to use our watches? Start by posting a comment below this post. Hopefully there will be a lot - let’s show them that people actually want this to improve.If you live in the US, tell your elected representatives to support legislation like ACCESS Act and AICO.If you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be petitioning Apple under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Change Windshield Wipers</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCL-wQNSixg</link><author>Dad, how do I?</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JCL-wQNSixg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw">Dad, how do I?</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How to Change Windshield Wipers

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio answer fan questions about particle colliders, time travel, and what existed before the Big Bang. 

The discussion begins with the Superconducting Super Collider – the massive Texas project that could have revolutionized particle physics in the US if it hadn’t been canceled. How might scientific breakthroughs have been different if the collider had been completed? Neil explains how the cancellation shifted the epicenter of particle physics to Europe and what that meant for the discovery of the Higgs boson.

From there, they explore the big questions: What existed before the Big Bang? Could we ever accelerate time to visit the past? We explore the multiverse, time dilation, and the poetic nature of scientific inquiry. Along the way, they discuss how science poses better questions rather than always finding answers, with nods to Isaac Newton and Star Trek’s influence on popular culture.

Are we made of stardust? Neil breaks down the cosmic origins of the elements in our bodies and what the future of human evolution might hold. Plus, they confront the mind-bending concept of infinity and whether there’s any evidence of parallel universes.

Prices are in USD. Pre-ordering is the only way to get one - they will not be sold in stores. Pre-order today at store.rePebble.com!Why are we making new Pebble-like smartwatches?Pretty simple - because we want one! No company has made a perfect smartwatch for people like us, so we’re going to make the exact smartwatch we want. Read the full story on my blog, but it comes down to 5 key features:Simple and beautiful designNo smartwatch on the market since Pebble offers this combination of features…until today!I think you might recognize this one 😉 It’s almost exactly a Pebble 2, upgraded with modern chips and new tricks. Duo is short for ‘Do-over’.Similar to Pebble 2, it featuresUltra crisp 1.26” black and white e-paper displayRuns 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfacesLightweight polycarbonate frame in two colour options - White or BlackWater resistant (targeting IPX8)30 day battery life (up from 7)Linear resonance actuator (quieter and stronger than vibrating motor)More reliable buttons (up to 30% longer lifetime in testing)Barometer and compass sensorsSince this watch will look and feel just like a Pebble 2, you can refamiliarize yourself with it via videos, or reviews. For people interested in hacking on PebbleOS firmware, we’re offering an optional JTAG connector. I recommend buying 2 units if you want to hack, just in case!This is my dream watch. It’s everything Pebble Time 2 was going to be and more! 64-colour 1.5” e-paper display. Same display as Pebble Time 2 - much more room for text and details (53% bigger and 88% more pixels)Runs 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfacesMetal frame and buttons (Black/White and likely a 3rd colour option as well)30 day battery life (estimate)Flat glass lens (less glare and reflections than Pebble Time family curved lens)Water resistant (targeting IPX8)Linear resonance actuator (vibrator)Standard 22mm watch strapThe industrial design is closely based on Pebble 2, which I really love. It’s slightly bigger to accommodate the larger display. Both the frame and buttons are made of metal (most likely CNC milled aluminum). More details, including final colour options, will be shared later this year. Left: Core 2 Duo - Right: Core Time 26-axis IMU, compass, barometerLinear resonance actuator (vibrator)Heart rate, step and sleep trackingEach watch runs open source PebbleOS. This enables all the baseline Pebble features like receiving notifications, timeline, watchfaces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking, etc. The really fun part is that most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist. Browse the full appstore on apps.rebble.io.Existing apps/faces will show up with a border on Core Time 2 until developers update them, since it has a larger display (200x228 vs 144x168 pixels). Read more about on the old Pebble dev blog.We will publish a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. My friend and past Pebble colleague, Steve, recently joined us to lead this effort. He’s joining crc32, long-time Cobble developer, who has been working with me since last summer. We’ll also be working on an updated SDK for creating new PebbleOS watchfaces or apps.These watches will be sold exclusively through store.rePebble.com. Due to limited supply of display inventory, both watches will be manufactured in limited quantities. I highly recommend placing a pre-order - we will be manufacturing fewer watches than the number of people who have signed up on rePebble already! A pre-order secures your watch but gives you flexibility if you change your mind - you can get a refund at any time up until your watch ships. Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samplesSchedule-wise,  is quite far along. We’ve already produced dozens of Core 2 Duo watches for testing and development. We’ve tested and confirmed our button improvements. PebbleOS has been compiled for the new architecture and runs on the watch. All firmware development is open source - you can follow the fun on Github and Discord. Our current schedule calls for shipments to begin in July. How are we so far along, given that PebbleOS was only open-sourced in January? Two things helped: a) I took a monetary risk and began product development a bit earlier 😉, and b) we found a supplier who still had inventory of some Pebble 2 components. Core Time 2 display lighting up! For , we’ve finished component selection, initial industrial and mechanical design, and found sources for long lead time components. Now, we’re in the middle of creating the first prototypes. The grand irony of hardware development is that software development is usually the slowest part of the project. Not this time! We’re extraordinarily thankful to Google for open sourcing PebbleOS, which gave us a massive boost.We’ll share more details (like Core Time 2 frame colour options) later this year, as we get closer to mass production. Our current schedule shows shipments beginning in December. Follow along on this blog, via email, on Bluesky or Twitter.Why were these specific specifications selected?Building a smartwatch is an exhausting (😂) exercise of constraint maximization. Think of it as linear algebra - we’re solving multiple equations with multiple unknown variables. The primary constraint is display selection. This choice governs the size and shape of the physical design, as well as being the component with the most power drain and biggest cost. Other variables are Bluetooth chip (governs: cost, software compatibility, engineering time), factory selection (cost, quality, speed, risk), sensors (power, cost, software), battery (size, battery life, cost) and more!Despite what Pebble’s second Kickstarter branding proclaimed, solving this inherently requires compromise. It’s a fine line to walk and generally the data is not 100% known upfront, so it inevitably requires some degree of trusting your gut. : we’re adding a touchscreen to Core Time 2. Why? Very specifically, I want to add the concept of ‘complications’ to watchfaces and widgets. Like on Apple Watch, these complications/widgets will show glanceable information like weather, next calendar event, step count, etc. The touch screen adds the ability to tap on the complication and directly open the associated app. This is much faster to use than opening an app via the button menu, and saves your quick launch (long-press on the buttons) for other apps. The touchscreen may be used for other interactions, like swiping to rapidly scroll down a list, but that will be lower priority. Core Time 2 will be the first PebbleOS watch to ship with a touchscreen, but not the first that we designed! In 2015, Pebble designed it into a watch called Cutts (or C2) and did some (very) preliminary software development work to integrate a touchscreen into PebbleOS.: I’m really excited that battery life will be increased from 7 days to 1 month! This is due to massive improvements in Bluetooth chip power efficiency over the last 10 years. : we’re adding this primarily for potential use in apps that benefit from audio output, like a ChatGPT or other AI agent app. It can’t easily be used for making voice calls, since the watches will not support Bluetooth Classic (required for headset profiles), but theoretically someone could write a custom voice calling client (eg SIP or something).: neither watch will support smartstraps. Sorry. Most people don’t even remember this feature even existed, which is kinda the answer to why it will not be supported. RIP.You shouldn’t get one if…You need a perfectly polished smartwatch. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile 🙂You’re looking for a fitness or sports watch. That’s not what we’re making. From what we hear, Garmin watches are great for runners/cyclists/triathletes!   You’re comparing this to an Apple Watch. There is NO way for a 3rd party smartwatch to compete with Apple Watch. Apple restricts 3rd parties in major ways - read my blog post for more information. For example, 3rd party watches on iOS cannot send replies to notifications.   These watches are not made for everyone. We want to be upfront with you about what to expect. Watch images above feature impeccably designed watchfaces from TTMM, including one of my all-time favourites - TTMMBRN. Thank you Albert!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Rules to Reasoning Engines // George Mathew // #296</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/From-Rules-to-Reasoning-Engines--George-Mathew--296-e30b6ik</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100030484/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-2-18%2F396796611-44100-2-7e9ea54af5997.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:19:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Rules to Reasoning Engines // MLOps Podcast #297 with George Mathew, Managing Director at Insight Partners.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter // AbstractGeorge Mathew (Insight Partners) joins Demetrios to break down how AI and ML have evolved over the past few years and where they’re headed.

--

Humans have been transforming seawater into potable freshwater for millennia. Today, billions of people can’t access clean drinking water, and 87 different countries are projected to be “water-scarce” by 2050. So, how can we use seawater desalination to combat water scarcity? And can we do it without further harming the environment? Manish Kumar digs into how scientists are creating freshwater.

"You can just talk to the large language models and they will code entire apps," Tan told CNBC (video). "You don't have to hire someone to do it, you just talk directly to the large language model that wrote it and it'll fix it for you." What would've once taken "50 or 100" engineers to build, he believes can now be accomplished by a team of 10, "when they are fully vibe coders." He adds: "When they are actually really, really good at using the cutting edge tools for code gen today, like Cursor or Windsurf, they will literally do the work of 10 or 100 engineers in the course of a single day." 

According to Tan, 81% of Y Combinator's current startup batch consists of AI companies, with 25% having 95% of their code written by large language models. Despite limitations in debugging capabilities, Tan said the technology enables small teams to perform work previously requiring dozens of engineers and makes previously overlooked niche markets viable for software businesses.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is Frontex enabling illegal pushbacks? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ46WQFO-4Q</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BJ46WQFO-4Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:00:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Frontex is the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, established in 2004 to assist EU member states in managing and securing external borders.

However, Frontex has faced ongoing criticism over allegations of failing to prevent or report alleged pushbacks, where migrants are forcibly returned without due process.  

This has sparked debates about its role, accountability, and the future of border management in the EU.

DESCRIPTION
This conversation between Duncan McGregor and Nat Pryce explores the legacy of Nat's co-authored book "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests" (GOOS) and how software development practices have evolved in the past 15 years.

They discuss the origins of test-driven development (TDD) within London's Extreme Tuesday Club, the shift from object-oriented to functional programming paradigms, and how changing technology has influenced development approaches.

Key topics include outside-in vs bottom-up testing strategies, mock objects, the rise of microservices, and whether modern development practices have actually improved productivity.
The conversation provides valuable historical context for understanding current software development trends while questioning whether some modern practices represent true progress.

From there, I can read the Protocol Buffer data Google uses to populate YouTube with ads. It is too CPU-intensive to decode Protobuf on the fly, so instead, I found a flaw in the Protobuf format which allows me to reliably change one byte to obliterate ads.What follows is a reference guide for setting up a bare-metal network router to block malicious ads, obnoxious ads, tracking, clickbait, crypto-jackers, scam popups, Windows spying on you, etc. using blocklists to protect all networked devices. Let’s build a cryptographically-strong router with FreeBSD and pfSense to completely block YouTube ads using a flaw in the Google Protocol Buffer format to completely block pre-roll, mid-roll, and end-roll YouTube ads on Apple TV and iPhones, network-wide. I want to support content creators, so to be fair, after a few months of blocking YouTube ads, I am now paying for YouTube Premium; Just because I can break something, doesn’t mean I need to.Part 1 – Setup pfSense on Bare-MetalPart 2 – Isolate Network LANsPart 3 – Setup DNS AdblockingPart 4 – Trick the YouTube Ad AlgorithmPart 5 – Decrypt HTTPS TrafficPart 6 – Intercept Apple TV and iOS YouTube AdsPart 7 – Reverse-Engineer Protobuf MessagesWhy block Malicious Ads and Behaviour Tracking?You are a valuable commodity that is bought and sold without your knowledge or consent. You will be tricked with clickbait, distracted with large ads, and enticed to leave the site you are on at every opportunity. Plus, everything you do online is being monitored so your habits and searches can be remarketed and sold over and over again for years. – Knowing what you like to watch and read, what phone you have, what you watch on Netflix, what you shop for, what you ask Alexa about, yout taste in music, etc. is  valuable to advertisers. Spying on people is such a big problem that Europe passed the GDPR law so every site you visit asks if you are okay with cookies (and we blindly click “ok” to hide the banner). We must wrestle back privacy ourselves. – If privacy doesn’t concern you, how about this: it is well-known that between 25% and 40% of network traffic is ads, tracking, JavaScript to load trackers (fingerprint.js, googletagmanager.js), websocket traffic to collect how you scroll and what you type (Hotjar), and the like. Do you have a 100 Mbps internet connection? Consider it 60 Mbps! – Then there is clickbait. “You won’t believe what Tom Cruise did. He…” and you may want to click. Then you are in the spider’s web. How about fake news? Or articles that don’t say “sponsored” in size-8 font, but now say “underscored” to be clever. What is even real anymore? As soon as you click on clickbait, you may end up on a page with a dozen more ads that aren’t approved by Google but lead to a dark world of maliciousness. Clickbait is so incredibly profitable to scammers. – Some websites will load crypto-mining JavaScript (e.g. CoinHive.js) so while you read, they overheat and abuse your computer to try to make a few pennies. Some sites will load JavaScript that tries to steal from your crypto wallet or trick you into transferring cryptocurrency. It is highly lucrative yet detrimental to you to track and trick you, and only  can do something about it.A virtual machine, Docker image, or Raspberry Pi are not performant enough to protect a whole SMB network; We need dedicated hardware with a cryptographic instruction set so that its only function is to route, decrypt, and monitor packets in and out. Here is what I used.A mini PC with the AES-NI instruction set (e.g. J4125)Several gigabytes of DDR4 RAM (e.g. 32 GiB)A decent mSATA SSD drive (e.g. 128 GiB)A USB drive to transfer pfSenseI’ve ordered a mini J4125 PC from AliExpress, ordered 32 GB of DDR4 RAM and a 128 GB mSATA from Amazon, and will assemble them for the first time now. Out of caution, I searched diligently for a barebones mini PC that did not include RAM or an SSD; there is nothing stopping an overseas seller from including some generic RAM and SSD but charging Samsung prices. 128 GB of disk space on a router? Yup. That should be plenty of space to hold logs and not wear down the SSD too quickly,  to allow beautiful packet capture (and maybe an edge cache for NPM and Docker?).A beautiful box, isn’t it? It only has 3 LAN ports, but it can be extended with network switches.Install pfSense on Bare MetalI’ve never used pfSense before, so we will explore this together. The compressed image is about 360 MB and can be flashed to a USB drive with an AppImage binary of Etcher (very cool). Decisions, decisions: VGA install or serial? Let’s serial into the new router. Why not?Well, that looks painful. It would also be a whole production to serial into the box in case of an emergency because the serial port is inside, and there isn’t even an RS232 or JTAG connector – just some narrow header pins. Yikes. Let’s go with VGA and plug a keyboard into the USB port – get ready to navigate with arrows and tabs.I’ll follow this guide on YouTube. I’ll pass on encrypting the disk since I would like to avoid entering a passphrase each time the mini PC reboots. A stripe disk is fine since there is only one disk. I have no idea what to expect yet, so I will pass on dropping to a shell for a more advanced configuration.I ejected the USB containing the boot image (important) and rebooted the little box. It played a melody on the internal speaker (there is an internal buzzer and thankfully it isn’t very loud).Do I need to have a LAN connection already, or can I just start the thing? I’ll just start pfSense and let it complain to me if it wants… and according to the YouTube tutorial, I should guess which port is LAN 1. I’ll do that now.I figured out that I should set the LAN 1 to a static IP address that is not in my existing router’s DHCP range, so I went with . Now I can access an admin web portal (/). Hooray.Yikes, the mini PC beeped at me and informed me that ‘admin’ has logged in. That startled me a bit, but hey that is pretty neat.Enable the AES-NI Cryptographic InstructionI played around with the wizard, used defaults, and got to the web configurator. The first thing that caught my eye was AES-NI CPU Crypto: Yes (inactive). I went out of my way to get a mini PC with AES-NI. What gives?Ah, this needs to be enabled in System > Advanced > Miscellaneous. Why not auto-detect this and use the best option? I’m glad I spotted that, or else this mini PC might as well be a Celeron J1900 of yesteryear.Having 32 GiB of RAM, let’s take advantage of that and use a generous amount of RAM for  and , and since hopefully this 128 GiB SSD has wear levelling, let’s take a RAM Disk backup every hour.Reboot!  is now active.This dashboard is pretty slick. I’m just discovering that there are widgets that can be added to the Dashboard, including S.M.A.R.T to alert us if the SSD is going bad. Nice.Hang on, when I added the Services Status widget, something called  shows up. What is that? Research shows it’s a daemon for hardware smart keys that we can probably do without(?). It can be disabled in the  file like so:Wait. After some time went by, I noticed the router slowed down, fatally. Do NOT try to disable the Smart Card Service as it is needed by IPsec; if you start experimenting with an IPsec VPN tunnel and the  daemon is disabled, then your hard disk will fill up with logs and your CPU will run hot.Adblocking with pfBlockerNGThis unboxing and setup has been fun, but I’d like to block all the bad traffic on my network. I’ve been using a workhorse of a DNS-level adblocker called Pi-Hole on a… yes, Pi, but it would be nice if I can reclaim that wee bit of hardware for something else and use a comparable add-on module in pfSense. Let’s explore that now.pfBlockerNG is a very powerful package for pfSense® which provides advertisement and malicious content blocking along with geo-blocking capabilities.Question: Do I install the first  or the  which feels like a developer version? I’m a software developer, so this is for me, but am I a pfSense developer? No. Maybe it will show me advanced logs or I can mess about with LUA? Let’s Google this.From here, random people are saying to install the development version. Another blogger advocates using the dev version as well. Meh, I guess we can install , , and Python 3.8. This doesn’t  like a development version since it has exciting dependencies.That was painless and only added an extra 20 MiB. It seems a lot of the dependencies are part of pfSense already. The knight at the end of Raiders would say that I have chosen wisely (hey, why did Indy age like a normal person up to Indy 4 if he drank the immortality water that the thousand-year-old knight also drank?).There are a lot of options in step three. This is not like Pi-hole at all. I’m going to come back to this and set up my network instead so I accomplish retiring my Nighthawk R700 or giving it new life as a Wi-Fi AP. If the  service won’t start or the status tab states , try deleting the empty file  (ref).Isolate LANs for SecurityAn opportunity has presented itself: I can create real networks on each of the three router Gigabit ports (not VLANs), and should I do so? Yes, yes I should. I would like a dedicated hardware network for all my home-phoning spy devices (Alexas and Apple TV) so they don’t flood my network with metrics info and “sure I’m muted and not listening to you” audio payloads back to their HQs.I can see it now: A Wi-Fi AP on a hardware LAN that is isolated from everything else and dedicated to these gadgets,  runs through the adblocker  traps hard-coded DNS queries to  and  and others (I’ll have to explore this) so YouTube on my TV doesn’t sneakily bypass  any DNS-level blocker. It’s so Utopian an outcome I may not be able to sleep.I’ve decided that my bottom-shelf TP-Link wireless router that is so old that  might as well be “A.D. 1200” is going to be my Wi-Fi AP for those IoT spy devices.In sum, there will be a dedicated hardware LANwith a wireless AP (AC1200) for Amazon/Apple gadgets and the TV.with a wired switch for all the beefy computers and clusters in my lab.with another wireless AP (R7000) just for iPhones and watches.As an aside, since doing an Offensive Security hacking course in my spare time, and I rare-earth-magnet-strongly suggest isolating Wi-Fi devices from any critical LAN segments connected to devices that touch daily banking or stock trading (or crypto wallets).Class B IPv4 172.31.1.0/24 Network for Untrusted DevicesThe class B IPv4 range 172.16/16 is a valid range of private IP addresses. I’m not uncomfortable with Alexa and Apple TV being even on the same class network as my main LAN segment, so I will banish them to the class B private network at the hardware level, and my more trusted LANs will be on the traditional class C network (192.168/16). This helps mitigate any misconfigured  rules by naturally having no routes between the two networks.Be sure to enable the DHCP resolver on the physical NIC that will connect smart devices (which mainly just tell me the weather and creepily listen to me sleep).From this point, DHCP works on this new network, but by default, it assigns IP addresses but does  routing. All traffic is blocked by default.We need to manually add rules so traffic on the physical NICs goe somewhere.There is a logging message. Let me reproduce it below.Hint: the firewall has limited local log space. Don’t turn on logging for everything.I read that to mean, “Congratulations on not cheaping out on your SSD. Now go forth and log everything, my son.”I’m not a new-age, fancy-jazz, coloured-light- or smart-plug-controlling guy who forgot how to turn on a light without his phone, so I do not need to have smart devices on the same network as my phone (why create dozens of wireless attack vectors into your home?). I’m classicly trained to actuate an electromechanical current interrupter on the wall and light let there be.Setup the Untrusted Wi-Fi APHow do I reach the admin UI of AC1200 Wi-Fi AP now? I factory reset it, plugged the WAN NIC into the ETH3 NIC of the pfSense router, but both devices are just blinking at me.I suppose I can just Wi-Fi into the factory-reset AC1200. Yikes, 2016 was a bad year for responsive web UIs I take it. This is horrible; I’ll pull out a netbook for this. One sec.It seems the Archer C5 has no AP Mode. This is my problem, not yours, but I’m still going to vent.Oh, and the “refresh” icon on the top of the DCHP Leases page in pfSense is not “refresh”, but “reload service”. Whoops.Well, I bricked the AC1200 router. I will have to run an Ethernet cable manually… but, wait, my thin notebook has no Ethernet ports and needs a USB-NIC adapter. Happy Friday. Connect LAN to LAN, not the AP’s WAN to pfSense’s LAN unless you want to do double NATing.There were shenanigans, but I set the LAN IP of the AC1200 to , the ETH3 NIC IP of the pfSense router to , and set the pfSense DHCP service on ETH3 to assign addresses . What  was setting the AC1200 to  as it was unreachable (reason unknown). Oh yes, I had to turn off firewally things and , and basically drop the horsepower of this TP-Link router down to that of a potato battery. The above settings allow me to access the AC1200 remotely now.The other video ran its course, so I started following this YouTube video (set the speed to 1.5x).One more thing: I installed the  package for pfSense and scanned the AC1200 router, and found some sneaky ports open.Port  is a print server port that I’ve now closed. However, the Archer C5 AC1200 is vulnerable to all kinds of Kali mischief so it was wise to put it on its own network. I’m not sure how to close port 22 and the  service on it the AC1200 because the stock firmware is ancient and crippled, so I’ll just have to block port 22 on the whole LAN segment.I’ve also taken care of disallowing private networks to ingress on the WAN (see the next section to set up DMZ).Unable to Reach 172.31.1.x from 192.168.10.xPing and Traceroute are aiding me in my efforts to connect to the AC1200 Wi-Fi AP from my  LAN. I went ahead and added the subnet to the Symantec Firewall rules just in case (Symantec has its place now and then, but yes, definitely have available PC CPU horsepower to spare).Now, it seems ICMP packets are no longer blocked between networks, but I still cannot ping the AP web management UI even though I can see the pings in the traffic logs.I’ve even added an “any to any” firewall rule on the Untrusted network. No change.Let’s try a stealth scan instead: sudo nmap -sS -v 172.31.1.*.Nope, pfSense doesn’t like that at all. And, the whole network stopped working. Nice security! Also, dang.The good news is that I’ve isolated the packet malaise to the TP-Link AC1200 box itself. I suspect that I need to add  to forward packets with no addresses in them, but I’d need root access to the AC1200. Let’s burn it to the ground and rebuild from its sprinkler-soaked ashes.Replace Stock Firmware on the AC1200 Wi-Fi Access PointOf course, I cannot actually stop Untrusted LAN devices from reaching the AC1200 as they all exist downstream from the pfSense box.DD-WRT open-source router firmware, meet my ancient Archer C5 and do your thing.The Archer C5 did not accept the DD-WRT firmware. Hmm… how about OpenWRT?The Archer C5 did not accept the OpenWRT firmware either. What the actual facepalm (WTAF)? My hardware is revision 2 using the Broadcom chipsets which are notoriously difficult networking chips. Devices with Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets have limited OpenWrt supportability (due to limited FLOSS driver availability for Broadcom chips). (REF: OpenWRT.org)Alright, so OpenWRT, DD-WRT, and Tomato projects have no firmware for this AC1200 with unpopular Broadcom chipsets. Into the refuse bin it goes.Archer C5 v2 into the Refuse Bin, R7000 as the New Wi-Fi API’ve dismantled the AC1200 so I do not forget why I threw it out. It’s too bad because it’s so pretty on the inside, and they always say, “It is what is inside that counts… except if you are a router with Broadcom chips.”The R7000 is factory reset, and here is the first problem: On factory reset, the Nighthawk R7000 is pretty uptight about the format of the password. One rule is that no more than two identical consecutive characters are allowed. Well, thanks Netgear for pretty much providing a Regex to password crackers. Let’s disable all those rules with a few keystrokes to delete the JavaScript “blocking” the form submission. Now my admin password does not conform to the Regex and is super long. Muhahaha to Netgear password crackers.The R7000 is in AP mode, but I can still access the pfSense web management page from the Untrusted network. Let’s lock down the web UI in pfSense under Firewall Rules.Set up the Trusted Wireless NetworkThe Untrusted network is now looking good. It’s time to make the  R7000 Nighthawk I have into a Wi-Fi AP as well so my phone and watch have a safe place to connect to, as well as a laptop when I want to RDP into my wired machines from the kitchen. I was saving that for a honeypot AP, but I can come back to that later.Let’s see if I can Wi-Fi into the Wireless LAN’s R7000… Remember to physically unplug the pfSense upstream router from the R7000 because the R7000 is too helpful and will enter into AP mode by sensing any upstream routers, then you cannot get into the web UI anymore.Since only my trusted devices should be on the Wireless LAN, I’ll turn off 2.4 GHz wi-fi because anything recent and wireless should support 5 GHz. That means those pesky AliExpress Pineapple wi-fi password stealers on the cheap side only use 2.4 GHz, so a neighbour is going to have to put in some effort to snoop on my network. Plus, 5 GHz is blocked more easily by walls and concrete, so I prefer it for averting medium-range snooping. But, I so am going to set up a honeypot and to brake check my faith in humanity.It is normally straightforward to put a Wi-Fi router into AP mode by disabling WAN and DHCP.Network Devices Interconnectivity CheckDo all my dozens of computers, laptops, Pis, clusters, NAS drives, and the like still connect as before? Most important is my web-scraping bot in a hardened, RAIDed, dedicated machine with its own UPS. But alas, I cannot SSH into it even though the SSH handshake packets make it to the hefty box.Could this be our old frienemy IPv4 forwarding being disabled? Possibly. I’m able to SSH into the machine from my iPhone (seriously) when on the same network.Nope. Adding  in the right place with a restart did not yield joy.According to  (to tail  logs), UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is not blocking ICMP requests or TCP requests on port 22. When I do something nutty like try to SSH on, say, port 23, then I can see the UFW block logs in . Confirmed: Packets can reach that machine.Running tcpdump src 192.168.10.100 where the IP is from the Trusted network on the target machine shows it  responding to pings. I’m even getting replies to SSH handshake requests. So now we know that  packets are being dropped. Interesting! Aside:  is awesome.Let’s follow the trail. Digging a little deeper I see replies to ICMP and SSH handshakes are being sent to some IP over HTTPS that I do not recognize. Bizzare. When I run the usual  tools I see that replies are going over a VPN that I completely forgot about. Ha. Replies to a different subnet are egressing over the VPN, but cannot return properly. Neat.Now that I remember what I did in 2019, I re-added NAT alias rules, and it’s showtime again.Windows File Sharing GotchasYour path may be smoother, but I’ve always seem to make the Trench Run instead of remote-piloting a handful of lead-filled X-Wings at light speed right  the Death Star’s reactor to make it go boom: the easy way.I’ve added some rules to allow Static DHCP devices to talk to each other – Windows devices – but by default, the Private Network in the Windows Defender uses the local subnet as the rule scope. That means different subnets are isolated. We can’t just relax the pfSense DHCP subnet mask to say  because it conflicts with another subnet. Instead, just to get file sharing working, I relax the  in Advanced Settings like below. Be sure to modify In and Out for SMB and ICMP.Again, please add whatever subnets you desire instead of .Public Service Announcement: Edge BrowserWhy does the Microsoft Edge browser start automatically and run in the background, and why can’t I kill it when I ? If you’ve asked yourself this, you’re not alone. It turns out Edge starts up when you log in and it keeps running in the background. Here is the fix:I suggest downloading Winaero Tweaker and applying registry tweaks to cut down on the Redmond Spy Machine.Block Clickbait, Endless Ads, and Dangerous SitesThanks to web-browser and DNS-level adblockers (i.e. Pi-hole), it’s commonplace to block bad sites, crypto-miners, fingerprinters, trackers, remarketers, banners, pop-ups, fake tech-support scam alerts, and all manner of unscrupulousness designed to take advantage of you. Let’s take pfBlockerNG on pfSense for spin. If you have multiple network interfaces (the mini PC has four), then you need to enable the Permit Firewall Rules for multiple interfaces and select them.Would you like to have discretion over blocklists? Let’s add a DNS blocklist related to gambling and reload pfBlockerNG to see if a poker site is blocked on the Trusted LAN.If you would prefer the connection to just close instead of rendering a PHP page, create a new PHP script with the following code and select it in the pfBlockerNG settings page:Intercept All DNS Requests, Even to Hardcoded DNS ServersLet’s make sure all clients behind the pfSense router use the local Unbound DNS server so pfBlockerNG can act on them. We do not want apps and home assistants to bypass our DNS server, so we have to add some NAT rules.First, we have to block DNS over TLS (for now) and only allow local DNS requests (note the rule order):Here is a NAT rule for one interface. I started by making a rule for each interface except WAN (obviously) like this below. NAT reflection should be disabled so the wild Internet cannot access our DNS server.To make life simpler, I made a firewall alias of all non-WAN interfaces called . Covering IPv4 and IPV6 to redirect local DNS queries on port 53 to localhost are the following redirect rules:Let’s also log trapped DNS requests. Head to the  page, click “Display Custom Options”, and add the lines:Well, hello there, Microsoft Windows. What are you up to trying to reach Google Tag Manager? Naughty OS. That request is now black-holed to a non-existent IP at .Let’s turn our attention to the TV and see how it fares under DNS interception.How to Restrict Apple TV and iPhone YouTube Ads? Regarding YouTube, YouTube has been showing 7-second and 15-second ads, twice, back-to-back, nearly every few minutes. Why are the ads incessant and so long? I do not mind the occasional ad, similar to live TV, but these frequent ads would warrant FTC complaints it they were on live TV.YouTube is tricky because ads are also videos that come from the same domain, so domain-name blockers like pfBlockerNG cannot act on them. The best pfBlockerNG and Pi-hole can do is block  only after you watch an ad video and click on the ad.Many people opt to use a web browser like Firefox or Chrome with uBlock Origin that acts on JavaScript as a workaround. It might be enough to watch YouTube on a web browser and stream that to a smart TV. However, we cannot restrict ads on the iPhone (without jailbreaking and compromising it).What are our options? How can we safely restrict YouTube ads on all network devices?Trick the YouTube Ad Algorithm Instead Among friends, let’s say that English-speaking countries get ads for the most ridiculous things because their residents are assumed to have disposable income. Can we instead make YouTube think we are an undesirable advertising target?What do ads in other parts of the world look like? Are those living in Antarctica or Low Earth Orbit getting a lot of ads too?What would happen if we leverage the capabilities of this pfSense router to route YouTube Location Tracking information through a VPN that terminates in some remote part of the world with fewer YouTube viewers per capita? In other words, let’s make ourselves undesirable to advertisers and see if we get fewer ads.Research into YouTube Advertizing SpendLet’s also check some YouTube statistics about viewers by country for insights. Thinking about following some Reddit advice and VPN’ing into India? Think again.That was 2019. This is 2020:I’m not a digital advertiser, but I can see that people in the UK and Canada watch a large number of videos per sitting. If I  an advertiser though, I’d pump those two countries with video ad after video ad because, statistically, those residents will take the eyeball kicking. All things being equal, I definitely need a VPN to terminate outside of Canada, the UK, and the United States (English-speaking countries) to enjoy YouTube more.Does age play a factor? Who  advertisers want? I want to be that guy on paper. Let’s trick YouTube into believing I am a 70-year-old male living in Italy. Yes, that should definitely cut down on the Nespresso and Starbucks ads, at least.How then to convince YouTube that I am a retired Sicilian living on a small chain island? I embellished that last part. Seventy and in Italy is sufficient.Let’s do this. In the YouTube account…It is doubtful that this is all it takes for our goal. Let’s find a VPN exit point in Italy.Nice. NordVPN has about 60 servers in Italy (that’s an affiliate link by the way).Selectively Route Apple TV Over the VPNLet’s go through some tutorials to set up  in pfSense. Just kidding! We’re going to use WireGuard – we have the Intel AES-NI crypto instruction set because we didn’t go cheap and get a yesteryear J1900 mini PC that sellers are trying to offload.I’ll now install the FreeBSD WireGuard package.Next, add a tunnel and enable it. According to this thread and this thread on Reddit, we need to get some information for WireGuard and NordLynx from a sacrificial Linux VM to transpose the settings (i.e. private key) to the pfSense router. No problem.Run sudo wg showconf nordlynx to see your private key needed by the pfSense tunnel config.Here are various screenshots that show the steps in more detail. Enter  and then  as the subnet mask. Do not go for  as there is a glitch or bug in the UI or whathaveyou. The result will still be .That should be enough to allow Diagnostics to  Italy.Now that the easy part is out of the way, let’s set some Policy rules to send the Apple TV traffic over the VPN to Italy as a baseline test.Traffic from LAN to WAN is processed as described in the following more detailed example.Port forwards or 1:1 NAT on the LAN interface (e.g. proxy or DNS redirects)Firewall rules for the LAN interface:Floating rules inbound on LANRules for interface groups including the LAN interface1:1 NAT or Outbound NAT rules on WANFloating rules that match outbound on WANI’ll make an alias, for now, to hold some clients that have static DHCP entries and hostnames I gave them in pfSense.Floating rules  have high precedence, so I’ll add some rules below the automatic pfBlockerNG rules that were created, and I’ll add a nice little blue separator while I’m here.And here is that rule as a very long screenshot:Apply. Wait. Let’s try it out using one of my notebooks connected to the Untrusted network.Google is in Italian. Very cool. Now for the Apple TV.Winner winner, chicken diner. All my YouTube is in Italian. I get some ads, not as many, but because Italians speak slowly and with a kind of sexy accent I do not mind the ads for Nutella at all.With this technique, I no longer feel manipulated by non-English ads. I have personalized ads , but given my new status as a retired gentleman I should turn that back on to scare away advertising dollars, er, euros. I wonder if Netflix and Amazon Prime behave any differently…Dang. Netflix is having problems. Amazon Prime is even worse. It looks like some CSS or font files are blocked as well, and the thumbnails aren’t loading. It’s time to move to Phase Two: Tunnel only YouTube traffic over the VPN. Do not try to send all the Apple TV traffic over a VPN because Netflix, Prime, and others are wise to VPN providers and have gotten great at geofencing.Selectively Route Apple TV YouTube Traffic Over the VPNLet’s start by adding Firewall Policy rules to send the most common YouTube domains over the VPN.As I’m about to add the rules, my hands hover over the keyboard not knowing what domains to tunnel. They need to be FQDN (fully-qualified domain names, no wildcards). Let’s open up a Chromium-based browser and see what traffic it generates in DevTools.Here are some candidate FQDNs to add:But wait, I hear you ask, why  and ? This is a preventative measure just in case one of those domains is geo-jacked (Geo-IP LowJacking). I wouldn’t put it past Google engineers to geo-jack the fonts domains like , but I’ll take a chance they don’t in the interest of scaling to billions of page views efficiently.Here are my new rules where I chain two of them using a tag so I can limit YouTube tunnelling to only the same untrusted machines (including Apple TV).And with that, YouTube thinks I’m in Milan, Netflix and Prime Video think I am still in Canada, and the ads… oh the ads… they are few and far between, and when they do come on, they are just a treat to listen to in that slow, lack-of-harsh-aspirants-or-yelling of a beautiful language Italian is.Gotcha: DNS Race ConditionA day has gone by and I’ve noticed that I only get Nutella and Ferrero Roche ads in the middle of videos, not at the start. Odd. I did some research and this is what I found:This means that the hostnames are resolved to IP addresses  and those IPs are used in my VPN tunnelling policy rules.A hostname entry in a host or network type alias is periodically resolved and updated by the firewall every few minutes. The default interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes), and can be changed by adjusting the value of Aliases Hostnames Resolve Interval on System > Advanced, Firewall & NAT tab. – pfSenseAh-ha, so I suspect there is a DNS race condition. Let me explain:This happens if, say, the Alias Daemon updates the IPs of the FQDNs. Then, I turn on the Apple TV for the first time all day. Since the usual TTL (time-to-live) of DNS queries is 1440 seconds (30 minutes), all the YouTube DNS entries will be cache misses and will need to be updated. At this point, the IPs from the second DNS queries may be from a pool and are not guaranteed to be the same that the Alias Daemon has. When the Alias Daemon checks again in five minutes, it may resolve the FQDNs to yet different IPs!Let’s solve this by overwriting whatever TTL (time-to-live) YouTube has in its DNS entries:And with that, no more DNS lookup race condition.Gotcha: Authentication Trouble, Forbidden 403 ErrorSometimes videos will not play. For security, YouTube embeds your IP in the  request. I’ve known about this since my post about Download YouTube 4K Videos with PHP back in 2016. The new problem is that various JavaScript and “are you human?” assets are tunnelled over VPN, but those darn domains like r5---sn-hpa7kn76.googlevideo.com are not tunnelled and thus come from the wrong IP. Queue the  error.Let’s fail fast with a quick experiment: I’ve gotten the IP of the above second-level domain name (SLD), added it manually to the list of domains/IPs to VPN tunnel, applied the change, and refreshed YouTube:Excellent. Now, we just need a way to tunnel that wildcard  domain. Unfortunately, the NAT and Firewall rules work with IPs, not wildcard domain names. Can we predict or enumerate these domains?Here is a Wireshark capture of DNS requests to  to show that the SLDs (second-level domains) are not eyeballably predictable:Let’s drop into a web browser with adblocking disabled and walk the HAR waterfall of my interaction with YouTube that led to ads showing up.What are GET requests likeGET https://r7---sn-uxa0n-t8ge.googlevideo.com/generate_204doing, exactly? I’ll give this problem some thought offline.Gotcha: YouTube is Now Showing UK Ads, Not Italian AdsBefore I could even solve the previous gotcha, British ads started showing up with the same frequency as if we did nothing. Ads from the UK are even more incessant than those from Canada, trailing behind the USA and India according to my earlier stats. It would be a complete failure if we get UK ads. Why does this happen suddenly? I’ve opened a fresh browser in a VM and tunnelled all traffic through Italy. The only leak I can find is when I query  on my Italian tunnel and see a UK address in the ASN. Could this small leak be our undoing?Even with my browser’s language set to  and location data off, this is the only leak I can spot. Then, in addition to a VPN exiting in Italy, it has to be one that doesn’t leak  (Autonomous System Numbers – used for automated routing) that gives up a different country. Dang, Google, you’re good. I’m going to have to bring my A+ game to this one.Find a VPN Exit Node with no ASN LeakBy visiting https://nordvpn.com/servers/tools/, I can see the VPN endpoint nodes in Italy. There are many Wireguard endpoints with NordVPN. Just to move things forward for this exercise, I’ll add an OpenVPN tunnel in pfSense and connect to several VPN nodes and examine the ASNs. It’s better than nothing, and more importantly, I’d like to eliminate the  as the leak of GeoIP information. Here is the guide I used.Through trial and error, I found a VPN node that is registered to an ISP in Italy as found in the  and  info.Hijack Google Video DNS QueriesTo make any of this work, I need a technique to route the wildcard  domain through the VPN. Suppose I write a plugin for pfSense that periodically s the DNS query log, keeps track of the  queries, and adds them to a unique list of aliases for Google Video domains; if backed by an LRU eviction policy, this could keep working indefinitely. However, if each video uses a unique, mangled domain, then this does not work unless I hit refresh on every single video.On the other hand, if I “hold up” the DNS query for the  domains, add the IPs to some alias list,  allow the DNS response to finish the round trip, we may be in business!Where to even start? Here are some Python example scripts just to get some inspiration. A quick, mental reverse-engineering of a handful of scripts reveals that there are some event hooks available. Nice.Among friends, let’s say that I can build up the pool of Google video IPs in real-time. How then to add these IPs programmatically to the firewall alias list for YouTube  restarting the firewall? One person actually hacked the PHP scripts in pfSense. Tempting, but I’ll do more research. Another person created a REST API for pfSense. Jackpot! We need to add IPs to the firewall policy rule to route YouTube videos over a VPN to avoid incessant and obnoxious North-American ads, but the IPs keep changing due to changing, mangled second-level domain names (SLDs). Using Python 3 and a REST API, we will monitor the appropriate DNS queries, note the IP(s) of the response, hold the response, add the IP(s) to the VPN tunnelling policy rule, then release the DNS query response.Research Python Methods to Hijack DNS RequestsWhy this approach? It’s future-proof, modular, elegant, maintainable, automated, and it lends itself to a future decision tree that could truly restrict YouTube ads outright.First, I will enable SSHd in pfSense and take a peek around.Let’s take this opportunity to make a disk backup.  or “duh” shows that only 800 MiB is in use on the SSD. Let’s  the whole box from our local machine in about four minutes. To verify the owners and permissions are set in the extended attributes locally, rungetfattr -d -m ^ -R -- ~/.pfsense-backupNow that we have a pfSense backup (I’m told just backing up  works too), let’s install the REST API.This part had me confused. You see, I was looking at the bottom of the screen wondering how the heck I could copy a truncated hash as a token. After a few tries, I noticed the green message at the top that I had been trained to ignore. It has the token.Next, with the API credentials set up, let’s try out the API:Explore the Unbound Python ModuleRunning  shows that the current version of Python is 3.8.As for the Unbound DNS Resolver, I had some luck tinkering in  and writing simple Python 3.8 code to log DNS query messages. We now have both parts needed to dynamically update the firewall aliases and tunnel all YouTube traffic once and for all.If you are looking for Python module docs for Unbound, here they are:Run these commands to quickly get the documentation. The example code is from Python 2.4, so be prepared to run Black and PyCharm code formatting, or run . Also, the most important part of this whole exercise (getting the IPs from the DNS reply) is missing, so here is the hint: . Don’t forget to manually hack the byte strings to pull out the proper IP addresses in binary form, first.Now we have Python docs and access to all the capabilities. Excellent.Next, take a backup of your OS or VM and install  and  wherever, ./configure --with-pythonmodule, , fix some errors in the Unbound code,  again, then you’ll have the generated python module () in order to remove all the missing-method red error lines in PyCharm.Smoke Test: A Python DNS-Hijacking ScriptHere is a smoke test of the ability to hijack  DNS requests with reply IPs that the script has caught in just a few minutes (the timestamps are just to maintain a crude LRU cache):Duplicate IP addresses are possible, and that is fine. I let the smoke test run overnight. Here is the PoC (proof of concept) script I ran as the Unbound Python module script.When I woke up, the Unbound DNS resolver service . Here are the logs: Capturing all the IPs from the DNS queries to  and  puts pfSense into a crawl as all the rules need to be reloaded on each addition. Research and install a Squid-like proxy, create a fake-but-trusted CA certificate, host it, install it in a browser as a PoC, decode TLS traffic, and victory dance.Actually, it is  illegal to jailbreak most Apple TV boxes, so we could break in, add a root certificate valid for the pfSense box, MITM traffic from the Apple TV, and then Microsoft Bob is your uncle. That works because the pfSense box as the gateway can decrypt Apple TV traffic, inspect the request headers for the offending ad , block the request, and re-encrypt other valid requests to Mountainview, California.But, then my iPhone would still show ads because it is harder to jailbreak, plus banking apps may detect this and not work anymore. Jailbreaking is too extreme, anyway. I used a jailbroken iPhone all the time in Japan because of a quirky cellphone law. You see, because of icky perverts who like to take photos inappropriately on elevators and escalators, Japan passed a law that made the camera shutter sound mandatory on all photos.Super unfortunate was that taking a  of a web page also made the same loud, unmuteable shutter sound. Imagine you are on a train and you screenshot a Google map, it makes that loud shutter noise, and then you get dirty looks from the train riders. Yeah, I had to jailbreak and zero out the camera sound file.Let’s see what it takes to spy on the HTTPS traffic from the Apple TV and iPhone to see if we can block ad URLs that way.Install a Fake-but-Trusted CA Cert on Apple TV and iPhone?Not wanting to jailbreak and add self-signed certs to Apple TV and iPhone, how hard would it be instead to add fake-but-trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to each device?The ‘A’ in CA means there is no one higher to vet such a certificate. The ‘A’ is so powerful, that back in 2001 only a Windows patch was able to revoke some dangerous Verisign certificates. As a thought experiment, new CAs must come into existence from time to time. Let’s Encrypt is relatively new, for example. There should then be an in-warranty way to get a fake, trusted CA cert into an Apple TV and iPhone. If that is possible, then an entire world of MITM spycraft is available to decrypt TLS packets in the clear and use good ‘ol URL blocking on requests likeLet’s see how easy this would be.In fact, there are many, many CAs. Here is a quick  in pfSense:Experiment with Squid and SquidGuardI’m aware of mitmproxy, but it needs to be side-channel installed onto the pfSense router. Let’s see if the  proxy that is available as a pfSense package can do what we need. First, I will take a bare-metal backup again so I can roll back in case  is better.I’ve installed those packages, and naturally, there are more buttons and options than in a space shuttle. I’ll find a guide.I’ve followed the steps in the guide, however, since I have a large SSD and generous RAM, I’ve made a dedicated folder  (and ) with 8 GiB of cache and a juicy allowance on the per-item cache size which should also help with Docker and NPM speed-up. Two birds, one stone. With Transparent HTTPS support, this should be pretty rad. If web traffic slows down while using Squid, here are some System Tunables that can make Squid faster (ref):kern.ipc.nmbclusters 32768Also, for local disk cache,  is asynchronous  (great for Docker too) and uses POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on disk-I/O.We can actually generate a CA cert in pfSense itself.Now, how to get it into the Apple TV and iPhone? It should be hosted somewhere, right? How about on the router?Self-Host the MITM CA CertificateSelf-hosting with a single command is ridiculously easy. From the SSH shell into pfSense, I can create a web folder and server like so:When I visit  I should get a blank page with “Hello”. From here, clients behind the pfSense router can temporarily access static documents.To make like easier, here is a PHP script to cause the MITM cert to download.As another smoke test, I’ll add the MITM CA to Chrome (manually) and enable the SSL Filtering. The defaults are fine in Squid. Here is the log file when I visit :However, on every other browser and machine there are HTTPS errors like so: If you get locked out of pfSense with a TLS error, you may have to disable Remote Cert Checks as the pfSense web configurator uses a self-signed certificate. Or else, you can bypass the proxy for the pfSense UI under Bypass Proxy for These Destination IPs with pfsense; pfsense.localdomain.Abandoning Squid: Too Slow, Too HeavyAfter a day of painfully setting up Squid and SquidGuard and adding blacklists and even manual regex for things like , I’m having nothing but issues with Squid. Here are the top pain points:It’s slow. It’s really slow.The ACL (Access Control List) settings are cumbersome.There is an issue with  (ref).The SquidGuard URL filter takes eons to update a list.The Squid UI is unbelievably lacking.Squid makes me sad. I don’t get sad, but Squid makes me sad with its promise and ultimate letdown. I’ve now obliterated Squid and restored the router from the  backup I made earlier. Here is a handy little script to show a diff of what has been added by Squid and related packages.The output is something like this under the  option:Install MITMProxy in a FreeBSD JailEven though written in Python, I’ll give mitmproxy a try next; at the very least it can be purpose-built to block YouTube ads with its rich API and Python-hook extensibility. It was a coin toss between  and  – a Metasploit hack tool – to achieve on-the-fly TLS interception, but the former can be scripted with Python and has a satisfying UI. Let’s go. Please read the whole section before trying any commands because I backtracked a bit but want to explain why.You’ll notice that there are only three binaries about 24 MiB each. As I understand it, they have a self-contained Python 3 environment and frozen dependencies. I’d like to jail these binaries because, well, because. First, let’s see if there is a vulnerability report for  at vuxml.freebsd.org. Nothing. How about at Exploit-DB? Nothing again. Good.First, what version of FreeBSD is this pfSense install?Now, according to this guide, I’ll need to set up jails myself as they are disabled in a default pfSense installation. Not knowing FreeBSD at all before today, I had to hack around to find a URL to download the  package manually. After another bare-metal backup, here are the steps I took:We need to do some hacking to get  working on pfSense’s take on FreeBSD because  is missing completely. What I’ve done is copy the  binaries  a jail (via ) back to the root system.Let’s set up a jail for . We must enable raw sockets in this jail to allow transparent proxy mode to work. If not, MITMProxy will report errors like “Transparent mode failure: FileNotFoundError(2, ‘No such file or directory’)” or “Cannot open connection, no hostname given.” This is because raw sockets are inaccessible and server information is unavailable. We can easily edit the  config file per jail like so: MITMProxy calls sudo -n /sbin/pfctl -s state but there is no  in . Run  inside the jail. If you are unsuccessful when you run  inside the jail, you may get an error like this: “ssend socket: Operation not permitted”. If you are successful, then  works as it needs access to raw sockets.Now we can copy over the  binaries and take them for a spin.Things are getting tricky with this next part. Running any of the binaries above results in:So, there is no  folder nor any similar dynamic linker that I could find. I tried this, however:Apparently, there is a  that can solve this for us (unavailable on pfSense), however, this is getting ridiculous! Let’s try a new tactic. Since we are in a jail, we are not bound to the crippled (read: secured) pfSense environment. Maybe we can install the  package normally in a jail?And, Bingo was his name-o. After this, simply running  in the jailed console opens the MITMProxy UI. Nice. Note, this version  be one or two minor versions behind the master branch. Let’s clean up with  and do another bare-metal backup.This is getting exciting. First, in pfSense, add a virtual IP for  attached to . Then, add a NAT rule to temporarily forward port  to  to access the proxy from the LANs.If not in the jail console, I’ll runand add the proxy setting  to my sacrificial notebook (that is auto-wiped daily). When the browser opens, we can already see colourful log entries in the MITMProxy UI.The next step is to get the auto-generated CA PEM file used by MITMProxy (~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem). Since any CA cert here is snake oil, I’ll use the provided one. TLS traffic from my devices is safe as long as I use my own proxies.Let’s put our experience from our previous attempt at self-hosting a CA into action. However, there is no PHP in the jail, so we can use a Python 3 web server instead. MITMProxy conveniently has onboarding settings to serve the same CA cert, as we did manually, just by visiting .After installing the CA in the Trusted Root Store on my clean notebook (and rebooting), I am treated to this display:Let’s see if we can get this cert on my iPhone.This is incredibly exciting. Can we LoJack the Apple TV box next?But wait, the router is slowing down.  is burning up the CPU… on idle.Of course: Python is a single-threaded paradigm with the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) ensuring threads do not actually run concurrently – unless they are blocking on I/O, which is the case here(?). Except, most of the CPU work is to generate TLS certs on the fly for each request. Yikes. Running  forgoes the UI and extreme logging. The extreme logging of all the headers and full responses heavily slows down , but  by default only logs entries like classic Apache logs – much kinder on the CPU. Some advanced, high-security web servers have trouble with the MITMProxy certificates due to Certificate Pinning – this is a technique where the server or the client know the fingerprint of the expected certificate in advance so it cannot be forged. A workaround is to use the  option to let them bypass the proxy.For my fun, I’ll go with this CLI command:While on YouTube, we can see the page ads clear as day with their unencrypted headers; can a simple regex now block them? They are exposed, and afraid, and their days have run out.We can even see details about each request. For example, all the SAN info is laid out for this wide-reaching certificate. There are curiously a lot of  domains covered by this cert.Shortly, I’ll write a Python script to block YouTube  URLs.Patch MITMProxy Source Code for Server SNI InterrogationThis step may be optional for most, but as a reminder to myself, to make  work better in Transparent Proxy Mode, the SNI of the server request needs to be checked against the list of regular expressions or else only the server’s IP is used for matching in many cases. Here is a quick patch I made that can be applied directly in the jail shell (or just type a few lines manually) for  version 7.0.4:Index:venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.pySubsystem:com.intellij.openapi.diff.impl.patch.CharsetEP===================================================================diff--gita/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.pyb/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.pyWith the above patch, I can now reliably intercept a few hosts and let all others pass through.Smoke Test: Intercept YouTube Ads with MITMProxyAfter reading the docs and navigating the  source code in the PyCharm IDE, I’ve written a little script to block ads and tracking URLs coming from YouTube from my clean notebook. I won’t reproduce the code just yet because it didn’t succeed in blocking ads as hoped, so instead, I’ll spend the time investigating why.Here are the smoke test filters I used where for a given top-level domain, URLs with the following partial strings are blocked:My initial results on blocking are positive. Everything I wanted to be blocked is faithfully blocked. Note, the  entries are due to my script, and the  failures are due to pfBlockerNG black-holing the request.Even in the DevTools network panel, the requests are truly blocked.Then how come I am still seeing ads? I’ve disabled HTTP/2 so that subsequent requests on the same channel don’t slide by. Mind you, sometimes the ads skip on their own, or fail to play, but they still show up. Interesting. Could YouTube be using WebSockets? I need some inspiration, so I’ll look at uBlock Origin’s regex filters for some ideas. If you see the error , then the DNS blocker (i.e. pfBlockerNG) is breaking the upstream TLS handshake for a given domain. Either whitelist it in pfBlockerNG (so the request goes through), or intercept it and block the connection in . This error happens to black-holed domains when the upstream TLS cert cannot be sniffed. The cleanest strategy is to use .Examine uBlock Origin Regex Patterns for InspirationHere are some of the regex/filters that uBlock Origin uses on YouTube.At first blush, it seems that a community of like-minded individuals is playing whack-a-mole with YouTube’s HTML and JavaScript. This has got me thinking: How does a video know to play an ad with JavaScript?How does YouTube know if the ad converts? They must target ads for individuals, so a given video must receive some unique information about an ad, such as the click link and alt text. WebSockets would be a pain to maintain, especially with all the mobile clients. They must be using stateless JSON to relay that pertinent information in an innocuous URL request that has no telltale signs of ad-ness. Let’s hunt for this info in the JSON replies captured by .Snap, Crackle, and Pop. We have a new plan: surgically alter the JSON response body to eliminate or Byzantine-up the ad information.Surgically Alter the JSON Response to Remove AdsAfter a bit more playful exploration, a trove of blocklorne URLs is right there in the JSON payload. In fact, most of what I am trying to block shows up right here:However, YouTube has bobby-trapped their UI and there is more than one way their obfuscated JavaScript code can pull down the ad details.Let’s blow it all away right now.After a lot of fun taking apart the YouTube UI and HTTP workflow, taking into account cookies and naughty service workers, I am successfully able to strip away all the pre-roll, post-roll, mid-video, and, well, all the video ads. Here is a screenshot from  showing how select REST queries are intercepted, decrypted, modified, put back into the response, and the headers updated (content length, etc.).With this new ability, we could even inject JavaScript into the main YouTube web page and subvert their JavaScript in a sort of ECMAScript arms race, possibly even leveraging some of the filters from uBlock Origin. However, we can hang our hats on this accomplishment for today. We can strip out ads from the JSON payload for YouTube web ads using a router.The iOS YouTube App Uses Protobuf, not JSONI can see very similar data in the Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) version of the same API calls as the web version to that of the YouTube iOS app. That complicates things, somewhat: We cannot lean on JSONPath to hunt down advertisement sections of JSON because with Protobuf the keys are just numbers that can even change. YouTube compiles a large list of all the ads you are going to see and sends that to you in a sneaky payload. In fact, it is easier to visualize this when reading Protobuf. If you manage to exhaust that list, then another large list will be coming your way.I can see strings like “Telus” and “Samsung TV” and “Boxing Week” and “Buy now”. Remember when YouTube was a fun place? A fable about a Golden Goose comes to mind, Alphabet.As a consequence of being able to see unencrypted traffic from my iPhone, I’m taken aback by the sheer amount of tracking information laid bare; It’s like I have electrodes on my head and chest while I’m running on a treadmill and a bunch of scientists in white lab coats with clipboards are standing shoulder-to-shoulder recording everything about my internals. Your apps are tracking you like crazy: what you do, how long you dwell, when you leave a given app, and so much more. The URL https://play.googleapis.com/log/batch shows up a lot in my logs.The next question is: Does the iOS app protocol behave like the web app?Timing Analysis to Detect Ad Videos?The iOS network traffic is not like the web traffic; Google has teams and teams of engineers dedicated to making sure blocking their ads isn’t computationally feasible. Daunted but undeterred, I was staring at network requests to let my mind zone out and wander when I noticed a pattern I had not noticed before.For the  version of YouTube, I can eyeball which URLs are ads and which are the videos I want to watch. Take a look:How am I able to eyeball which video URLs are ads in this chaos?Take a look at the query parameter . For the web version, a chunk of the video I want is fetched from the 0th byte, then immediately another video is fetched with a  starting again at the 0th byte. Both happen near-simultaneously – faster than a human can click on a new video. It turns out this, as well as examining the  parameter for the length of the full video (short videos are likely ads), can reasonably allow us to detect and doctor ad videos.However, the iOS YouTube protocol does  use the  query parameter or even the  header; video chunks use a counter like  and  etc. We must reverse engineer the Protobuf responses.Decode the YouTube Protobuf ResponsesHere are some decoded Protobuf log files I created then opened in the PyCharm IDE.After logging decoded Protobuf messages to disk for offline analysis, I did notice something that piqued my interest.entitlemententitlementI wonder what would happen if I were to, say, toggle those? This is tantalizing, but it is cheating, and hence no fun. Back to heuristics. As with JSON, can I blow away the Protobuf sections that serve up ads? Could I instead detect the ad videos in the payload, then dynamically modify their responses to be, say, a cached 0.01s video file? The 30s ~ 300s of unskippable ads could be over in the blink of an eye without blocking all those URLs.Let’s start by blocking the ads as intended.The Protobuf responses are a hot mess of bytes, but there are human-readable URLs that can be grepped.You’d think a simple LRU cache that blocks soon-encountered ad URLs could be the way to go, but, alas, the ad URLs do not quite match the URLs sent over the wire. Also, who is to say that YouTube won’t randomize the position of query-string parameters one day? We need an  lookup of flagged ad URLs that are polymorphic (and group homomorphic) to live ad URLs.It might be tempting to split a query string into a sorted dictionary and reassemble it, but we have no way of knowing what the query string boundary is. Plus, a live ad URL could add a key and disrupt the sorting.Addionally, I’ve encountered URLs like this that purposely try to obfuscate the query params:https://r4—sn-vgqsrns6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback/expire/1640607416/ei/WFrJYdWnFfyTsfIP4s2BsAk/id/o-AE7swWOPOwXu3GyRght/requiressl/yesmm/31,26/…Notice how  is just ?I propose heuristically scanning for query and path parameters of ad URLs with high entropy and using those as keys (fingerprints). For example, inhttps://.googlevideo.com/initplayback?source=youtube&orc=1&oeis=1&c=IOS&oss=1&oda=1&oad=5500&ovd=5500&oaad=11000&oavd=11000&ocs=700&oputc=1&oses=1&ofpcc=1&osbr=1&osnz=1&msp=1&odeak=1&odepv=1&osfc=1&id=&ip=&initcwndbps=&mt=One could note the following candidates in descending order of length:Any or all of them could be lookup keys each pointing to the same dictionary of deconstructed query parameters. A lookup of a live URL would involve the same process of finding the highest entropy parameters and checking the URL dictionary for a match. The cache data structure can even be multi-level with the root keys being just the length of the high-entropy strings. Even with the ability to block polymorphic URLs, the video ads are still indistinguishable from content video without context from the Protobuf structure.Smoke Test: Intercept and Decode Protobuf in Python Decoding ~500 kiB of raw Protobuf in pure Python is painfully slow.Decoding ~500 kiB of Protobuf in pure Python, especially the decoding step of converting it to over 1 MiB of human-readable text to parse the ad URLs, takes more time than the connection timeout most of the time. I’ll run some benchmarks using pure Python vs. the native C++ library.If you caught that, it takes about  in Python, and  in C++! In this Never Ending Story, we have to find a way to parse the raw Protobuf payloads in Python using the C++ library . In the interest of time, I’ll use  and communicate with the C++  binary directly (since raw decoding is not supported in Python anyway).Fuzzing the YouTube Video Ad ResponsesHow about fuzzing the ad video responses? Now being able to isolate ad videos, as a smoke test, I sent back  responses with empty bodies and the iOS app went bananas; it was as if there is an infinite loop with no delay just hammering YouTube’s own servers trying to get the next part of the video in panic mode. I felt bad for their servers, so I stopped. Then, what would a happy-path response payload look like?Try as I might, when I send back empty s, s, s, truncate response bodies, or just null-out part of the ad video, the iOS app crawls then crashes spectacularly with a dying breath of a messed up iOS UI. I now block some error reporting endpoint at  that indicates a “dev assertion failed” so I don’t make some overworked QA pull out their hair. We’ve learned that blocking ad URLs causes the app to deploy countermeasures and even when defeated, the app hangs forever on the ad screen. We’ve also learned that fuzzing ad videos often causes the app to crash – there is even session meta data in the video response chunks.Let’s go back to what worked with JSON and obliterate the section of the Protobuf responses that contain the array of ad details.Enter Burp Suite Tools for Penetration TestingThere is a library for Burp Suite called  (get the original Burp Suite version,  the PyPi fork, unless you like infinite recursion bugs) that is designed to decode raw Protobuf wire messages, inject something naughty, then re-encode them again to see how a Protobuf endpoint behaves. We are going to have so much fun together in this next section.You may encounter a small world of pain because some forks of blackboxprotobuf will cause a stack overflow due to deep recursion. You can see this by adding sys.setrecursionlimit(200).Compiling the original library source code for Burp Suite and using the C++ bindings will allow us to transcode ~500 kiB of raw Protobuf bytes in just a few seconds. At the top of your import chain before you import , addto use the C++  implementation whenever possible.It is now possible to generate a best-guess  schema with a single function:The schema isn’t perfect, and it is huge and deeply nested, and takes forever to pretty-print, and is probably wrong, but is just good enough to pull out the ad details like so (Protobuf to JSON in this sample):The Python schema is huge and looks like this for about 250,000 more charcters:Reverse engineering the Protobuf schema sounds good on paper, but our target is spectacularly complex and a moving target.Exfil the Proto Schemas from the App, Cleanly?As fun as it to reverse the Protobuf and generate a best-guess schema, wouldn’t it be more ninja-like to exfil the actual, working  or schema files from the smartphone app? Let’s pull out the Protobuf schemas from the Android version of the YouTube app and see if the schemas are the same or compatible.This is what I tried , but it went nowhere with the Protobuf Toolkit (PBTK). I reproduce it here so I remember what I tried:After installing Qt dependencies (pronounced “cute”), I was treated to a GUI.Next, I got the most recent release of a 100 MiB Android APK file from apkpure.com.Excited in vain, the most PBTK could get was a 59-byte proto file. Another tool called Apktool also looked promising, but the best it can do is  bytecode, not decompile it – this may be good enough for Pen Testers, however.You can see that Google went out of its way to complicate reverse engineering.Google thoughtfully did leave some hints.Upon deeper inspection, the Protobuf classes are right here, in Java, decorated with getters and setters. Since we are using Python, and we cannot get the true schema files, I will leave this approach for now.Hardcore Deep-Dive into Protobuf and Wire FormatAfter gazing into a sea of decrypted network traffic again, then triggering errors and assertion fails on my iPhone with Protobuf fuzzing, and taking a peek at the error logs being phoned home, I’ve noticed that ads register for “slots” in a given video. They can register for pre-roll, mid-roll, end-roll, full-page, and ad pods (back-to-back ads). Blocking an ad URL causes an error along the lines of “some ad that doesn’t exist booked a slot” and UI panic sets in.I’m back. The Wire Format is surprisingly elegant, except for ZigZag encoding. Through trial and error, editing out chunks of Protobuf with a hex editor is just a no-go.While computationally expensive, decoding, editing, and re-encoding without the original schema leads to a modified encoding. This is likely because we cannot detect if ZigZag encoding is being used, or if a number is an , , , , etc., plus the order of object fields is normally non-deterministic. Here is some Protobuf trivia on the matter:Exploit a Protobuf Flaw to Easily Remove All Ads by Changing One ByteCasually poring over the C++ source code, an interesting comment in the Protobuf code caught my eye: is used to keep track of fields that were seen when parsing a protocol message but whose field numbers or types are unrecognized. This most frequently occurs when new fields are added to a message type and then messages containing those fields are read by old software that was compiled before the new types were added. (ref)Yes, what to do with unknown fields? What to do indeed. And, how easy would it be to say, change a  field key to, say,  thus making an entire substructure of advertisement and tracking information suddenly unavailable? Tantalizing.And, if we can calculate the field tags in bytes with bit-twiddling, then can we use a simple regex to AMF the section of ads in  time?As a motivating example, I’d like to find the field key  which is not as simple as searching for . Here is an implementation of a tag-scanning algorithm so you can see the bit-twiddling:We know the wire type is  (length-delimited nested string/message), and one target field  is . When bit-twiddled, we get the target where the final  happens to mean  (the wire type) in hex. In binary, this is:10101010 11111111 10111000 10111100 00000001Let’s lose the MSB from each byte as per the var-length wire format:.0101010 .1111111 .0111000 .0111100 .0000001Then we shift and add only the first four bytes since the LSB is first:Finally, we shift out the number of wire type bits (3) to get back the field key:395198378 >> 3 = 49399797And that, folks, is a taste of how Wire Format works.Fantastic. Now, all we have to do is scan the Protobuf bytes for classic ad URL signatures like  to bound our field search, then move backward from there until we find the target(s) field tags and thus field keys we would like to denature (e.g.  –> ).Notice how the Protobuf response payload is ? As I said, Google makes it computationally expensive to decode, alter, and re-encode without the C++ source proto files, but a quick linear scan takes no effort at all.Just a quick note, there is more than one field tag, but not all of them represent ads. That is why we need to backtrack from the  markers.Smoke Test: Remove Ads from Protobuf in O(n)-Time In one pass with no additional memory, I’m able to scan a huge 1.8 MiB chunk of jibberish-looking Protobuf data, and in the screenshot below only at the 30,593 byte (of 1.8 MiB) is our target found, and then backtracking ~600 characters yields our target field key to denature. Not only is this amazing, but I don’t even need to block  or URLs with  in them; Those requests are never made in the first place, anymore.Analysis of this Successful Adblocking TechniqueBy taking advantage of a feature (flaw?) in Protobuf that allows it to be backward compatible with schema changes, along with the fact that Protobuf is very sensitive to byte changes due to its compact nature, we can change a single byte in a critical location and tell Protobuf that an entire section of deeply-nested data is from a future schema version and it should be ignored.Google returns huge responses in Protobuf (e.g. 1.8 MiB) – including even the layout of the iOS app – so only C++/Swift is fast enough to understand it all before the connection times out. I’ve shown that Python is several orders of magnitude too slow in decoding these Protobuf payloads, so connections do time out waiting on Python. With web-based JSON, the whole payload needs to be parsed, edited, and re-serialized; With my Protobuf technique, it takes microseconds thanks to a single linear scan and then ultra-quick backtracking. This technique is suitable for real-time adblocking without blocklists.All those  and  URLs on Apple devices originate from the Protobuf payload. This means they all go away for free – we don’t need to block them. In fact, the YouTube app is zippier because fewer connections are made to ad URLs in the first place. This means we can avoid keeping a blocklist of YouTube ad URLs and stay on the sidelines of the whack-a-mole fun. Ads do not register for video location “slots” on the Apple devices and the content just plays.This is a heuristic technique that looks for two strings:  and some calculated field tag nearby, so this technique is designed to be future-proof.Even if Google changes the field tag (and breaks millions of apps and Apple TVs before they upgrade), it’s an academic exercise to enhance the following script to discover the new field tag(s) automatically.Should Google be Worried?This is a highly-specialized technique to block Apple-device YouTube ads (or Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. tracker blocking). The CPU requirements to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS traffic greatly exceed those available to Raspberry Pis. Even if some company takes my script and considers making and selling a NIC dongle, it would likely not be powerful enough. An Nvidia Shield could handle it, but if you already have Android devices, then just hack the binaries; My technique is for Apple device owners where we don’t want to compromise the OS so that further reduces the audience of this technique.The MITMProxy YouTube Adblocking ScriptHere is the MITMProxy addon script that serves as a proof-of-concept to block YouTube ads on networked Apple devices. The script can be run as follows (note the prerequisites in the script and be sure to install them first). Name it  and run the following command:mitmdump --listen-port 8080 --listen-host 127.0.0.1 -s "youtube.py"Here is the script, including a fairness function to allow ads 5% of the time:This script happens to work in Python for a TLS-decrypting man-in-the-middle proxy written in Python. As a working proof-of-concept, it’s pretty rad. Of course, it can be rewritten in Rust or Go or anything but single-threaded Python, but as an intellectual exercise to defeat ads that are served from the same domain as content, it’s elegant.It’s unknown if CAD  $11.99/mo ($13.43/mo with tax) is even reasonable: Do I personally incur CAD $11.99 of cost to advertisers each month?Since ads are auctioned, the CPV (cost-per-view) varies. Also, many ad campaigns have a capped daily budget, so theoretically there should be fewer ads in the evenings as budgets run out during the day.I watched YouTube on and off for a day on a clean notebook computer with private browsing. My history showed that I only “watched” 10 videos:I fast-forwarded through a few of them to get past the “like and subscribe” runtime padding.I jumped to the end of one just to get to the “top three” from a “top twenty” list.Two were low quality so I left early.The rest were music videos.In all, for watching parts of 10 videos, I was exposed to 8 ads, and only two were skippable (which I skipped).Let’s use USD $0.15 as a CPV. In one day, let’s say, I incurred 8 x $0.15, or $1.20 to advertisers. Extrapolated to one month, that is roughly USD $36/mo. Do I really cost advertisers USD $36/mo for very casual YouTube viewing? That sounds terrible for advertisers.CPV from US Advertising Spend Divided by Total ViewsFrom Statistica, in 2019, US YouTube advertisers spent $15.1 billion dollars. Also in 2019, US residents had 916 billion views (ref). That works out to an average of $15.1B / 916B, or USD $0.0165 per view. Then for me, that is only USD 13 cents. Extrapolated to one month, I theoreticaly cost advertisers only USD $3.96/mo.Is YouTube Premium Worth It?When I allowed ads for my experiment, I hit the hardware mute button. I also looked away because I have several computers with a lot going on. Ad spend is wasted on me, but I still want to support content creators. For me, CAD $13.48/mo is more than I incur on actual ads and more than I pay for a Netflix subscription. The only way to justify the cost is to have YouTube playing constantly in the background on a TV.However, I truly enjoy a handful of creators, so I may start watching them in the background on non-stop play. Let’s give the three-month YouTube Premium trial a chance, and I will still be monitoring what they track about me.Recently I learned that due to abuses of the DMCA Act of 1998, YouTube content creators who make reaction videos and “easter egg” videos may have their videos claimed by big companies like Sony and Viacom. That means that from when a claim is made, all ad revenue goes to those big companies, and not even to the creators. That means in all likelihood I unknowingly may not even be supporting my favourite YouTube creators. Many fair-use and video-game-commentary videos may have automated copyright claims against them, meaning that ad revenue goes to big companies with deep legal pockets and your favourite creators may get nothing, so more and more creators leave YouTube for Twitch.Summary of AccomplishmentsI rarely give up, so this is an example of going into an extreme problem-solving mode to solve a fun problem loosely using cryptography and reverse engineering. In the end, a single byte turned it all around, so it was all worth it to come to an elegant and satisfying solution. We were able to set up a hardware router from scratch, segment LANs into trusted and untrusted zones, set up traditional DNS adblocking, add a transparent MITM proxy, and ultimately block YouTube ads on networked Apple devices.Note: This was a hard problem – now solved – so I am paying for YouTube Premium to give the CPU a rest.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Download of the day: GIMP 3.0 is FINALLY Here!</title><link>https://www.cyberciti.biz/linux-news/download-of-the-day-gimp-3-0-is-finally-here/</link><author>Vivek Gite</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 03:45:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cyberciti.biz/atom/">Dev - NixCraft</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ow!

We discuss how to use plyometric work to improve mobility, strength, posture, and overall health.

We emphasize the enormous benefits of skipping—a form of plyometrics—for joint health, aerobic conditioning, and coordination, as well as its advantages for people of all ages and fitness levels. We also explore the expressive nature of human movement, highlighting how certain movements reveal and can evolve one’s unique personality and abilities.

Stu explains how resistance training, skipping, and striding can improve movement efficiency in all aspects of life. Anyone who exercises, as well as serious athletes, will benefit immensely from Stu McMillan’s knowledge of human mechanics and the practical tools he generously shares in this discussion.

Before we start, a warning: This concert includes a song about suicide.

From the moment Yseult stepped behind the Tiny Desk to rehearse, her fearless, full-out energy left the team in shock. The French singer-songwriter blends chanson française, R&B and pop with a punk-ish je ne sais quoi. You may have seen her perform during the closing ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics, but her vulnerability and experimentation makes Yseult a no-brainer for our Tiny stage.

The vigorous set kicks off with two hauntingly beautiful tracks, "SUICIDE" and "MTV." Yseult then offers a glimpse of an unreleased song, "PROBLEMATIC," followed by the upbeat "CUTE," which coaxes the crowd with its playful, yet smooth groove. The final song, "GARÇON," is the cherry on top of a performance that will be etched in my brain forever. Yseult does all this while donning a T-shirt with the words "BITCH YOU COULD NEVER," a song title from 2024's MENTAL, on full display. Honestly, she's right. I don't think any artist could have done what she did.

If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 9-8-8, or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.

Have you ever walked away from a conversation feeling dismissed, overlooked, or drained — but you couldn't quite put your finger on why? 

You're not imagining it. 

Disrespect is everywhere, and often, it’s so subtle that you don’t realize it’s happening until it’s already taken a toll on your confidence, energy, and peace of mind.

In today’s episode, Mel breaks down 6 sneaky ways people are disrespecting you every day — at work, in relationships, even within your own family — and, more importantly, exactly what to do about it. 

Whether it’s someone constantly talking over you, dismissing your feelings, or always running late (yep, that’s disrespectful, too), you’ll learn how to respond in a way that protects your energy and commands the respect you deserve.

If you’re tired of feeling unseen, unheard, or undervalued, this is the episode for you.

But in Germany, almost all the country’s natural peatlands have been drained. Now, they’re emitting greenhouse gases. People around the world are currently working to rewet the moors - while keeping them usable for agriculture.

Dry peatlands are responsible for seven percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Taken together, all the moorland areas in Germany cover over 1.5 million hectares. However, much of this moorland has given way to pasture and arable land over the centuries. Drained, the moors lose their ability to store greenhouse gases. In Germany alone, they could store about as much carbon as the entire German forest - but they must remain wet.

Scientists Greta Gaudig and Sabine Wichmann from the "Greifswald Moor Centrum” are working on a strategy to rewet the moors, while keeping them usable for agriculture. To accomplish this, they are testing the cultivation of peat mosses and cattails. These materials could be used to produce environmentally friendly potting soil and building materials. This way, farmers could continue generating income while saving the moors.

In Bristol, young entrepreneurs are producing a sustainable down substitute using cattails. With success: because the product is selling well, several farmers in England are converting their drained fields back to wet moorland for farming. For the first time, they have found a way to protect the moors and continue to make a living from their land.

 In 2023 I tried out Codon. At the time I had difficulty compiling the scripts I most commonly used, but was excited by the prospect. Python is essentially single threaded and checks the shape (type) of each variable as it interprets scripts. Codon fixes types and compiles Python into compact, executable binaries that execute much faster. 

Several things have changed with their latest release: I have successful compiles, the committers have added a compiled version of NumPy (high performance math algorithms), and changed their open source license to Apache 2. 

"The other big news is that Exaloop, the company that is behind Codon, has changed their license to Apache 2..." according to the article, so "commercial use and derivations of Codon are now permitted without licensing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Land Your Dream Job Faster in 2025 with Akaza.io</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxF4h-7nA7s</link><author>That Career Coach - Kendall Berg</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fxF4h-7nA7s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:01:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ1a2a26kcwJiomdJR8N0g">Podcast - Career Coach</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ditch the endless custom resumes and 1000s of ghost job postings with @akaza.io and get your perfect match jobs delivered in your feed.

Despite the show’s breakout success, another animated sitcom didn’t really come around until December 17th, 1989, when The Simpsons -- originally from a short segment on FOX’s Tracey Ullman Show -- starred in a Christmas special that would quickly earn the animated family their own ongoing series.

ABSTRACT
So far, most attention to GenAI in software development is on generating code. But there is as much, if not more, value in understanding existing code - particularly long-lived, large, and complex legacy systems.

At Thoughtworks we have been experimenting with using this technology with our clients, embodied in a tool called CodeConcise, which combines an LLM with a knowledge graph derived from the abstract syntax trees of a codebase. We have found this useful both to draw out low-level requirements and to build a high-level explanation of a system.

This talk will show what we have learned and how it could change the age old challenge of wrangling legacy at speed, iteratively and with zero downtime. [...]

Hundreds of children of members of Islamic State (IS) are stuck in Syrian camps. Often, with no hope of returning to their home nations.

Around 38,000 foreign nationals - more than 60 per cent of whom are children - are being held in Al-Hol and Roj, two closed, sprawling camps in north-eastern Syria that have been holding mostly spouses, other adult female relatives and children of male IS suspects since 2019. 
Most of the children are under 14 years old and many have spent most, if not all, of their lives in the camps. Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children. But France has taken a different position, refusing to repatriate the children, unless they are orphaned. In France, their families are waging a fierce battle against the government to bring these children home.

InfoWorld writes that "The initiative promises dramatic improvements in editor startup speed, build times, and memory usage, making it easier to scale TypeScript to large code bases, Microsoft said."

Microsoft's TypeScript team expects to be able to preview command-line type-checking in Go-based tsc by mid-2025, and to deliver a feature-complete Go implementation of TypeScript by the end of the year. [You can build and run the Go code now from Microsoft's new working repository.]
 Developers who use Go-based TypeScript in the Visual Studio Code editor will feel the increased speed in the editor, Microsoft said. The company promises an 8x improvement in project load times, instant comprehensive error listings across entire projects, and greater responsiveness for all language service operations including completion lists, quick information, go to definition, and find all references. The new TypeScript will also support more advanced refactoring and deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute, the company said. 

Microsoft believes native Go implementations reduce build times by up to 10x, notes Neowin. But "Developers can expect TypeScript 6.0 to have some deprecations and breaking changes to support the upcoming Go-based version."

Later this year, Microsoft will be releasing this new native Go implementation as TypeScript 7.0. The current JS-based TypeScript codebase will continue development into the 6.x series until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption, since some projects may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other things that are not supported by TypeScript 7+. 
TypeScript's original creator Anders Hejlsberg recorded an announcement video — and also shared his thoughts in a GitHub discussion titled simply... "Why Go?"
The TypeScript compiler's move to Go was influenced by specific technical requirements, such as the need for structural compatibility with the existing JavaScript-based codebase, ease of memory management, and the ability to handle complex graph processing efficiently. After evaluating numerous languages and making multiple prototypes — including in C# — Go emerged as the optimal choice... 
Let's be real. Microsoft using Go to write a compiler for TypeScript wouldn't have been possible or conceivable in years past. However, over the last few decades, we've seen Microsoft's strong and ongoing commitment to open-source software, prioritizing developer productivity and community collaboration above all. Our goal is to empower developers with the best tools available, unencumbered by internal politics or narrow constraints. This freedom to choose the right tool for each specific job ultimately benefits the entire developer community, driving innovation, efficiency, and improved outcomes. And you can't argue with a 10x outcome! 

Hejlsberg also addressed their choice of Go in an online interview with the Michigan TypeScript meetup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neil deGrasse Tyson &amp; Charles Liu Make Predictions About the Future</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izTre_7g1XU</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/izTre_7g1XU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What does the future hold? Neil deGrasse Tyson teams up with comic co-host Chuck Nice, Gary O’Reilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu to break down our visions of the future – and take Neil to task on his own predictions.

The conversation kicks off with the accuracy of science fiction predictions. Are we living in The Jetsons era yet? We explore the years that science fiction takes place and compare them with where we are now. From Amazon’s robotic warehouses to AI assistants, how much of our future is already here – and what did sci-fi get wrong?

We break down technology in Blade Runner, Black Mirror, and The Twilight Zone and question whether we’re headed straight towards a dystopian future. We discuss the purpose of predictions and how they can help us not only inform our future but act as an early warning sign. 

Plus, we discuss the Turing test and whether what we really need is a test for consciousness. Do we even need machines to mimic human thought? Can technology ever fully control human perception, or is that a fear rooted in fiction?

Looking to 2050, Neil shares predictions from his book Starry Messenger, including the rise of commercial space industries and self-driving cars. Will neuroscience cure mental illness? Will space tourism become a booming industry? Plus, Charles, Chuck, and Gary add their own predictions of the future to the conversation.

Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi came up with a design that can help buildings adapt to the looming threat of climate change.   

His work began in the floating community of Makoko in the Nigerian capital Lagos. Many residents live in simple houses built on stilts over a lagoon, which makes them particularly vulnerable to rising tides and extreme weather.  

Inspired by local engineering, Adeyemi came up with the “Makoko Floating System”, which allows for buildings to float on water. Its pyramid shape makes it more stable and prevents rainwater from pooling. 

On a large scale, Adeyemi hopes that his design can help Makoko, and other places around the world, adapt to the rising sea.

Wade and James’ quest for justice began more than ten years ago when they filed civil lawsuits against some of the late entertainer’s corporations in a California court, alleging that MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures enabled and covered up their sexual abuse as children. The Jackson lawyers have fought back, accusing the men, amongst other things, of being liars and arguing that there is no basis in law for the men’s claims. 

The documentary picks up the story of the two men’s legal battles in the wake of the 2019 release of the 'Leaving Neverland' documentary, which alleged that the entertainer had sexually abused Wade and James over a period of years. In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade’s and James’s civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. 

The documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. 

Material for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.

Charities that refurbish and distribute computers to low-income individuals must choose between providing soon-to-be-insecure Windows 10 machines, transitioning to Linux -- despite usability challenges for non-tech-savvy users -- or recycling the hardware, contributing to ewaste. Tom's Hardware reports: So how bad will it really be to run an end-of-lifed Windows 10? Should people worry? [Chester Wisniewski, who serves as Director and Global Field CISO for Sophos, a major security services company] and other experts I talked to are unequivocal. You're at risk. "To put this in perspective, today [the day we talked] was Patch Tuesday," he said. "There were 57 vulnerabilities, 6 of which have already been abused by criminals before the fixes were available. There were also 57 in February and 159 in January. Windows 10 and Windows 11 largely have a shared codebase, meaning most, if not all, vulnerabilities each month are exploitable on both OSs. These will be actively turned into digital weapons by criminals and nation-states alike and Windows 10 users will be somewhat defenseless against them."
 
So, in short, even though Windows 10 has been around since 2015, there are still massive security holes being patched. Even within the past few weeks, dozens of vulnerabilities were fixed by Microsoft. So what's a charity to do when these updates are running out and clients will be left vulnerable? "What we decided to do is one year ahead of the cutoff, we discontinued Windows 10," said Casey Sorensen, CEO of PCs for People, one of the U.S.'s largest non-profit computer refurbishers. "We will distribute Linux laptops that are 6th or 7th gen. If we distribute a Windows laptop, it will be 8th gen or newer." Sorensen said that any PC that's fifth gen or older will be sent to an ewaste recycler.
 
[...] Sorensen, who founded the company in 1998, told us that he's comfortable giving clients computers that run Linux Mint, a free OS that's based on Ubuntu. The latest version of Mint, version 22.1, will be supported until 2029. "Ten years ago if we distributed Linux, they would be like what is it," he said. But today, he notes that many view their computers as windows to the Internet and, for that, a user-friendly version of Linux is acceptable.

Lip-Bu Tan has been tapped as new CEO for the semiconductor company as it has struggled with both chip manufacturing and chip designing. Unlike Intel, companies specialized in either designing chips–like AMD or Nvidia–or manufacturing chips–like TSMC. 

WSJ explains how a mistake Intel made in the mid 2000s has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle for the tech company that Lip-Bu Tan will have to face.

From a report: The gains present "a great opportunity" for the lender to assign its engineers to other projects, Beer told Reuters ahead of DevUp, an internal conference hosted by JPMorgan, bringing together its top engineers in India this year. The largest lender in the U.S. had a technology budget of $17 billion for 2024. Its tech workforce of 63,000 employees, with a third of them based in India, represents about 21% of its global headcount. The efficiency gains from the coding assistant will also allow JPMorgan's engineers to devote more time to high-value projects focusing on artificial intelligence and data, Beer said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers astonished by tool’s apparent success at revealing AI’s “hidden objectives”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-astonished-by-tools-apparent-success-at-revealing-ais-hidden-motives/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/robot_personality-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 20:03:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a new paper published Thursday titled "Auditing language models for hidden objectives," Anthropic researchers described how custom AI models trained to deliberately conceal certain "motivations" from evaluators could still inadvertently reveal secrets, due to their ability to adopt different contextual roles they call "personas." The researchers were initially astonished by how effectively some of their interpretability methods seemed to uncover these hidden training objectives, although the methods are still under research.While the research involved models trained specifically to conceal information from automated software evaluators called reward models (RMs), the broader purpose of studying hidden objectives is to prevent future scenarios where AI systems might deceive or manipulate human users.While training a language model using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reward models are typically tuned to score AI responses according to how well they align with human preferences. However, if reward models are not tuned properly, they can inadvertently reinforce strange biases or unintended behaviors in AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You have to see this if you have anxiety | Mel Robbins #Shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHUAVop7WCM</link><author>Mel Robbins</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHUAVop7WCM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2U-Oqn7RXf-ydPqfSxG5g">Podcast - Mel Robbins</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Order my new book, The Let Them Theory 👉 https://bit.ly/let-them 👈 It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

Melanie Lynskey discovers a potential match for her great-grandfather with the help of DNA and a wedding announcement. Other than these clues, this mystery man had very little records to prove his existence.

New Zealand-born and Emmy Nominated actress Melanie Lynskey has become an industry staple, having amassed a plethora of thought-provoking roles in television and film over the course of 30 years. Lynskey’s career began in 1994 with the release of Peter Jackson’s acclaimed film Heavenly Creatures, which earned her a New Zealand Film Award for Best Actress. Subsequent film credits include Adam Mckay’s Don’t Look Up, Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Steven Soderbergh's The Informant, Tom McCarthy's Win Win, and many others.

Lynskey recently starred in HBO’s critically acclaimed The Last of Us, a series adaptation of the widely popular 2013 PlayStation video game of the same name and from 2003-2015, Lynskey had a popular recurring role as Rose in the hit TV show Two and A Half Men.

The double-edged sword that can make or break a TV show, cementing it forever as an icon of the medium, or dooming it to bar trivia night obscurity. 

When a popular TV show does something provocatively against the mold, networks can expect to see some angry letters, protests, or even outright boycotts. Some of these episodes deserve the criticism they get, but should we give some of these other shows a break?

ABSTRACT
AI is advancing at a rapid pace and it is transforming the way we approach development. This rapid evolution raises a number of questions and concerns regarding safety, process, and the most effective ways to leverage these powerful tools when they work directly with code.

In this talk, Michael Feathers will describe practices that acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based technology. We'll touch on practices related to code and test generation and as well as safe refactoring, design exploration and ideation. This talk is for anyone with development experience who wants to improve their practice. [...]

According to a bug report on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls "locs"), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: "I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly."
 
The AI didn't stop at merely refusing -- it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that "Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities." [...] The developer who encountered this refusal, posting under the username "janswist," expressed frustration at hitting this limitation after "just 1h of vibe coding" with the Pro Trial version. "Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn't matter as much as a fact that I can't go through 800 locs," the developer wrote. "Anyone had similar issue? It's really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding." One forum member replied, "never saw something like that, i have 3 files with 1500+ loc in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing."
 
Cursor AI's abrupt refusal represents an ironic twist in the rise of "vibe coding" -- a term coined by Andrej Karpathy that describes when developers use AI tools to generate code based on natural language descriptions without fully understanding how it works. While vibe coding prioritizes speed and experimentation by having users simply describe what they want and accept AI suggestions, Cursor's philosophical pushback seems to directly challenge the effortless "vibes-based" workflow its users have come to expect from modern AI coding assistants.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microservices, Where Did It All Go Wrong? • Ian Cooper, James Lewis &amp; Kris Jenkins</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWJYzpvoeEY</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kWJYzpvoeEY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:39:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024.

The researchers tested eight AI-driven search tools by providing direct excerpts from real news articles and asking the models to identify each article's original headline, publisher, publication date, and URL. They discovered that the AI models incorrectly cited sources in more than 60 percent of these queries, raising significant concerns about their reliability in correctly attributing news content.Researchers Klaudia Jaźwińska and Aisvarya Chandrasekar noted in their report that roughly 1 in 4 Americans now use AI models as alternatives to traditional search engines. Given that these models struggle significantly when specifically asked to attribute news sources, this raises broader questions about their general reliability.Citation error rates varied notably among the tested platforms. Perplexity provided incorrect information in 37 percent of the queries tested, whereas ChatGPT Search incorrectly identified 67 percent (134 out of 200) of articles queried. Grok 3 demonstrated the highest error rate, at 94 percent. In total, researchers ran 1,600 queries across the eight different generative search tools.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Astrophysics Can (LITERALLY) Save the World</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfkU4CD91hk</link><author>PBS Space Time</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cfkU4CD91hk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 20:11:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Remove your personal information from the web at https://joindeleteme.com/SPACETIME

If successful, it could serve as an alternative to the chokepoint at the Suez Canal in Egypt. Turkey, Qatar and the UAE have all expressed support for the megaproject, but geopolitical tensions in the region are complicated, with some of its neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Russia and China being part of their own competing trade routes. Baghdad also has to navigate political instability within its own borders amongst rivalling factions.

Their identities remain a mystery - but Injuries found on them suggest that they all suffered brutally violent deaths.

Dr Jo Buckberry, a battle trauma expert at the University of Bradford, believes they date from 1296 to 1357 - the Scottish Wars of Independence.

Today Jo is going to reveal to us the clues that might help identify who these people were and uncover how they met their ends. And to help add some extra historical context she's  joined by History Hit's very own Medieval expert Historian and Author Matt Lewis.

The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself.

--

For as long as humans have had lice, we’ve fought hard to get rid of them. Nit combs, the fine-tooth brushes used to remove lice and their sticky eggs, have been found among the ancient remains of cultures across the globe. Today it’s estimated we spend billions of dollars each year treating infestations. So why are lice so difficult to get rid of? Nazzy Pakpour digs into these stubborn insects.

DESCRIPTION
Holly Cummins talks with Ben Evans about his latest book "Optimizing Cloud Native Java", which updates his previous work "Optimizing Java" to reflect the realities of cloud native environments.

Ben explains that performance engineering is not just technical but also psychological, emphasizing the importance of user expectations and defining clear performance goals. They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.

The book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the "fighting animals" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.

Finally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.

OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector. The Trump administration has generally signaled its intention to take a hands-off approach to regulating the technology. But many states are actively weighing new measures on everything from deepfakes to bias in AI systems.Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, said in an interview that the US AI Safety Institute – a key government group focused on AI – could act as the main point of contact between the federal government and the private sector. If companies work with the group voluntarily to review models, the government could provide them “with liability protections including preemption from state based regulations that focus on frontier model security,” according to the proposal.“Part of the incentive for doing that ought to be that you don’t have to go through the state stuff, which is not going to be anywhere near as good as what the federal level would be,” Lehane said.In its policy recommendations, OpenAI also reiterated its call for the government to take steps to support AI infrastructure investments and called for copyright reform, arguing that America’s fair use doctrine is critical to maintaining AI leadership. OpenAI and other AI developers have faced numerous copyright lawsuits over the data used to build their models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boost Your Energy &amp; Immune System with Cortisol &amp; Adrenaline | Huberman Lab Essentials</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wFucddupQlk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:01:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how specific hormones influence both energy levels and the immune system and discuss practical tools for increasing energy throughout the day and managing stress.

I discuss the mechanism through which cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline) impact the brain and body and why it’s important to regulate their levels, considering factors like time of day or stress levels. I also cover the positive benefits of short-term stress and behavioral protocols to increase energy and enhance stress resilience. Additionally, I explain how to optimize hormone levels through tools like sunlight exposure, meal timing, and supplements such as ashwagandha.

Huberman Lab Essentials episodes are approximately 30 minutes long and focus on key science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will continue to be released every Monday.

Amodei made the provocative remarks during an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, acknowledging that the idea "sounds crazy.""So this is—this is another one of those topics that’s going to make me sound completely insane," Amodei said during the interview. "I think we should at least consider the question of, if we are building these systems and they do all kinds of things like humans as well as humans, and seem to have a lot of the same cognitive capacities, if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck."Amodei's comments came in response to an audience question from data scientist Carmem Domingues about Anthropic's late-2024 hiring of AI welfare researcher Kyle Fish "to look at, you know, sentience or lack of thereof of future AI models, and whether they might deserve moral consideration and protections in the future." Fish currently investigates the highly contentious topic of whether AI models could possess sentience or otherwise merit moral consideration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>If You’re Feeling Uncertain &amp; Anxious, You Need to Hear This | Dr. Julie on The Mel Robbins Podcast</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjvPbfxE3CI</link><author>Mel Robbins</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bjvPbfxE3CI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:00:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2U-Oqn7RXf-ydPqfSxG5g">Podcast - Mel Robbins</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Order my new book, The Let Them Theory 👉 https://bit.ly/let-them 👈 It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

Spend a few weeks with WWE and you'll see how many tastes the product caters to. Segments can lean into different genres, such as drama, action, comedy, or even horror. Matches themselves are meant to capture a broad spectrum of styles, from Luchadors hitting highspots, to grueling submission matches to storybook endings by way of title matches that took years to build toward. The idea is to offer different styles and flavors to different segments of the audience. WWE 2K25 translates all of this variety very well, offering up many game modes, most of them worthwhile and often attracting different types of players. There are some flops on the card, but overall, this remains another main event-level display.WWE 2K25 is a great game in its own right and feels like the culmination of several years of effort to fix the series by the Visual Concepts team. WWE 2K20 was so bad and went so viral for that reason that the following year, the game didn't launch a new version--that's virtually unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and ) games. It clearly helped. Since then, it's been slowly and steadily improving year over year, making WWE 2K25 the best game in the series.In the ring, the biggest change is the addition of intergender matches. In the indie wrestling world, it's very common to have men and women wrestle each other without any added drama or lampshading. Promotions simply depict the competitors as equals--save for someone working heel who might call attention to it, of course. But WWE has long avoided similar matchups. This year, the studio finally got the go-ahead from the wrestling behemoth, so you can now, in one surely popular example, play as Rhea Ripley and squash Dominik Mysterio ad nauseam. It's great to see WWE becoming more comfortable with this idea and breaking down that needless barrier in its video game.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mark Klein, AT&amp;T whistleblower who revealed NSA mass spying, has died</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/memoriam-mark-klein-att-whistleblower-about-nsa-mass-spying</link><author>leotravis10</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:05:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EFF is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mark Klein, a bona fide hero who risked civil liability and criminal prosecution to help expose a massive spying program that violated the rights of millions of Americans.Mark didn’t set out to change the world. For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?” We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&T’s central office in San Francisco, called Room 641A. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—made a copy of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.A photo of the NSA-controlled 'secret room' in the AT&T facility in San Francisco (Credit: Mark Klein)Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator Chris Dodd, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tourMark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013. But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.And the fight is not over. The law, called Section 702, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google’s new robot AI can fold delicate origami, close zipper bags without damage</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apollo_humanoid_robot-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:38:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Google DeepMind announced two new AI models designed to control robots: Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER. The company claims these models will help robots of many shapes and sizes understand and interact with the physical world more effectively and delicately than previous systems, paving the way for applications such as humanoid robot assistants.It's worth noting that even though hardware for robot platforms appears to be advancing at a steady pace (well, maybe not always), creating a capable AI model that can pilot these robots autonomously through novel scenarios with safety and precision has proven elusive. What the industry calls "embodied AI" is a moonshot goal of Nvidia, for example, and it remains a holy grail that could potentially turn robotics into general-use laborers in the physical world.Along those lines, Google's new models build upon its Gemini 2.0 large language model foundation, adding capabilities specifically for robotic applications. Gemini Robotics includes what Google calls "vision-language-action" (VLA) abilities, allowing it to process visual information, understand language commands, and generate physical movements. By contrast, Gemini Robotics-ER focuses on "embodied reasoning" with enhanced spatial understanding, letting roboticists connect it to their existing robot control systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Surprising advice if you feel overwhelmed right now | Mel Robbins #Shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndYMbkdoJ7M</link><author>Mel Robbins</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ndYMbkdoJ7M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:30:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2U-Oqn7RXf-ydPqfSxG5g">Podcast - Mel Robbins</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Order my new book, The Let Them Theory 👉 https://bit.ly/let-them 👈 It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

I have some surprising advice for you if you’re feeling overwhelmed right now… You need to ADD something to your life.

I know, it sounds insane. I didn’t believe it at first either.

When you add something that you love to your life, it shifts your brain’s focus to that positive thing, instead of focusing on all the negative, overwhelming stuff going on. 

What can you add to your life? 👇

“We are what we repeatedly do. 
Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” 
Aristotle

Every small choice you make help shape the person that you become. 

Your character isn’t built with one decision, but in the small, consistent actions and choices that you make each moment of every day

Just making yourself aware of that can make all of the difference in your life 

God bless you 🙏🏻

Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.
 
For months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.
 
DW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.

[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience. This was incorrect. The reports referred to two senior staff members, not directors. We regret the error.]

He argued AI will boost programmer productivity rather than eliminate jobs. "If you can do 30% more code with the same number of people, are you going to get more code written or less?" he asked. "History has shown that the most productive company gains market share, and then you can produce more products."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>$1,200 Vs DIY (Save $$$)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzWZ8WdLhCs</link><author>Mr. Build It</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tzWZ8WdLhCs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:48:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCziz6FiCnkyQ810X7qXFMZw">Mr. Build It</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Use code MRBUILDIT130 to get $130 off across your first 4 boxes of Good Chop at https://bit.ly/40cNEsu!

So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action modelTo be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In our tech report, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.To operate in our dynamic, physical world, robots must be able to seamlessly interact with people and their surrounding environment, and adapt to changes on the fly.Because it’s built on a foundation of Gemini 2.0, Gemini Robotics is intuitively interactive. It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input. It also continuously monitors its surroundings, detects changes to its environment or instructions, and adjusts its actions accordingly. This kind of control, or “steerability,” can better help people collaborate with robot assistants in a range of settings, from home to the workplace.The third key pillar for building a helpful robot is acting with dexterity. Many everyday tasks that humans perform effortlessly require surprisingly fine motor skills and are still too difficult for robots. By contrast, Gemini Robotics can tackle extremely complex, multi-step tasks that require precise manipulation such as origami folding or packing a snack into a Ziploc bag.Finally, because robots come in all shapes and sizes, Gemini Robotics was also designed to easily adapt to different robot types. We trained the model primarily on data from the bi-arm robotic platform, ALOHA 2, but we also demonstrated that it could control a bi-arm platform, based on the Franka arms used in many academic labs. Gemini Robotics can even be specialized for more complex embodiments, such as the humanoid Apollo robot developed by Apptronik, with the goal of completing real world tasks.Enhancing Gemini’s world understandingAlongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.Responsibly advancing AI and roboticsAs we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, holistic approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a Robot Constitution inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the new ASIMOV dataset will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.This work was developed by the Gemini Robotics team.

ABSTRACT
An informative guide to what is special about the Rust programming language and how to bring the best parts of it into your software project, whichever programming language it's implemented in.

Rust programmers spend a lot of time thinking about lifetimes, ownership and borrowing. So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).

We'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn! [...]

However, it can be cumbersome for working with lengthy SQL queries, and its data exploration tools are limited.
Many of the available third party UIs are great, but selecting, installing, and configuring one is not straightforward.
Using DuckDB through a UI should be as simple as using the CLI.
And now it is!Starting with DuckDB v1.2.1, a full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box!
You can start it from the terminal by launching the DuckDB CLI client with the  argument:You can also run the following SQL command from a DuckDB client (e.g., CLI, Python, Java, etc.):Both of these approaches install the  extension (if it isn't installed yet),
then open the DuckDB UI in your browser:The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to define SQL scripts and show the results of queries.
However, its capabilities go far beyond this.
Let’s go over its main features.The DuckDB UI runs all your queries locally: your queries and data never leave your computer.
If you would like to use MotherDuck through the UI, you have to opt-in explicitly.Your attached databases are shown on the left.
This list includes in-memory databases plus any files and URLs you’ve loaded.
You can explore tables and views by expanding databases and schemas.Click on a table or view to show a summary below.
The UI shows the number of rows, the name and type of each column, and a profile of the data in each column.Select a column to see a more detailed summary of its data.
You can use the  button near the top right to inspect the first 100 rows.
You can also find the SQL definition of the table or view here.You can organize your work into named notebooks.
Each cell of the notebook can execute one or more SQL statements.
The UI supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete to assist with writing your queries.You can run the whole cell, or just a selection,
then sort, filter, or further transform the results using the provided controls.The right panel contains the Column Explorer, which shows a summary of your results.
You can dive into each column to gain insights.If you would like to connect to MotherDuck, you can sign into MotherDuck to persist files and tables to a cloud data warehouse crafted for using DuckDB at scale and sharing data with your team.The DuckDB UI is under active development. Expect additions and improvements!Like the DuckDB CLI, the DuckDB UI creates some files in the  directory in your home directory.
The UI puts its files in a sub-directory, :Your notebooks and some other state are stored in a DuckDB database, .When you export data to the clipboard or a file (using the controls below the results), some tiny intermediate files (e.g. ) are generated.
Your data is cleared from these files after the export is completed, but some near-empty files remain, one per file type.Support for the UI is implemented in a DuckDB extension.
The extension embeds a localhost HTTP server, which serves the UI browser application, and also exposes an API for communication with DuckDB.
In this way, the UI leverages the native DuckDB instance from which it was started, enabling full access to your local memory, compute, and file system.Results are returned in an efficient binary form closely matching DuckDB’s in-memory representation (DataChunk).
Server-sent events enable prompt notification of updates such as attaching databases.
These techniques and others make for a low-latency experience that keeps you in your flow.In this blog post, we presented the new DuckDB UI, a powerful web interface for DuckDB.The DuckDB UI shares many of its design principles with the DuckDB database.
It’s simple, fast, feature-rich, and portable, and runs locally on your computer.
The DuckDB UI extension is also open source: visit the  repository if you want to dive in deeper into the extension's code.The repository does not contain the source code for the frontend, which is currently not available as open-source.
Releasing it as open-source is under consideration.We are very happy to see the overwhelmingly positive response to the announcement of the DuckDB Local UI. In this short update, we’d like to address some of the questions raised by the community:Regarding the licensing of the frontend code (HTML, JavaScript, etc.), MotherDuck is currently reviewing licensing options for the UI code and assets and will clarify shortly.Regarding offline (“air-gapped”) operations, we are working towards supporting offline usage in a future version, and are currently exploring how to provide version notifications as upgrades become available.Regarding the client-server protocol for the UI, we’re going to work on opening up the client-server protocol so that other user interfaces can use the “back-end” part of the UI extension to run queries in DuckDB.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Burning Conditioning</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLUwA3aSyIM</link><author>10% Happier</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YLUwA3aSyIM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:39:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3AWCFuxotrXmgqUHQdwyg">Podcast - 10% Happier</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.

The Responses API will eventually replace the current Assistants API, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026. With the new offering, users can develop custom AI agents that scan company files with a file search utility that rapidly checks company databases (with OpenAI promising not to train its models on these files) and navigate websites -- similar to functions available through OpenAI's Operator agent, whose underlying Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model developers can also access to enable automation of tasks like data entry and other operations.
 
However, OpenAI acknowledges that its CUA model is not yet reliable for automating tasks on operating systems and can make unintended mistakes. The company describes the new API as an early iteration that it will continue to improve over time. Developers using the Responses API can access the same models that power ChatGPT Search: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. These models can browse the web to answer questions and cite sources in their responses. That's notable because OpenAI says the added web search ability dramatically improves the factual accuracy of its AI models. On OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark, which aims to measure confabulation rate, GPT-4o search scored 90 percent, while GPT-4o mini search achieved 88 percent -- both substantially outperforming the larger GPT-4.5 model without search, which scored 63 percent.
 
Despite these improvements, the technology still has significant limitations. Aside from issues with CUA properly navigating websites, the improved search capability doesn't completely solve the problem of AI confabulations, with GPT-4o search still making factual mistakes 10 percent of the time. Alongside the Responses API, OpenAI released the open source Agents SDK, providing developers free tools to integrate models with internal systems, implement safeguards, and monitor agent activities. This toolkit follows OpenAI's earlier release of Swarm, a framework for orchestrating multiple agents.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Origins of Jim Crow</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-origins-of-jim-crow</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67cf1c54d64d9d8e86eefa65/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BsnePbprmy9HgeeTXRDwUqmLjz6BLGqp2UScy-aVocY" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Jim Crow era is one of the darkest periods in American history.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio answer questions on the Higgs Field, dark energy, and the feasibility of Dyson spheres with astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi.

We discuss Hakeem’s role as CEO of the Astronomical Society, and his work on NASA’s IMAP satellite, designed to study the boundary of our solar system. He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn’t wear gold.

Then, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe’s expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.

Next, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter—could it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what’s been eluding us.

Plus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself—what would happen if we were hit by one? Is “now” just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up.

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.

The young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin’s high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.

Justin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.

Conor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he’s running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.

Despite the government’s promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be stopped with known measures.  

For many people, like César Serrano, it was as if time had stopped, “it's as if a huge storm has come and wiped out everything. Everything is completely deserted, lifeless, closed.” 

It felt like something out of a disaster movie. First came the fear of this unknown virus, followed by lockdowns. Once the first wave had passed, restrictions in some places were eased. Then came further waves and restrictions, but people got used to the changes in their daily life.  

As the pandemic entered its second year, expressions of solidarity, seen at the start, gave way to frustration and anger. People took to the streets in anti-government protests and conspiracy theories spread. People also began to question the price they had paid for efforts made at protecting themselves and others against this virus. 

What impact did the coronavirus pandemic have on our life?

--

Industrial manufacturers spend a huge amount of energy generating heat to make everyday materials and objects, like cement, steel, and paper. And since most companies use fossil fuels to reach these high temperatures, industrial heat accounts for 20% of our annual global carbon pollution. Thankfully, this is where a century-old technology comes in. Rachel Yang explores how heat batteries work.

In his search for identity, he examines his culturally American upbringing and the importance of passing on the CHamoru language and traditions to his sons. As he meets with language advocates and youth in Guam, he wonders, is there hope for future generations of CHamoru speakers to preserve the language?

As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of  capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.You can , which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run  and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including the TypeScript compiler itself.
Here are times to run  on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an 8x improvement in project load time in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as .
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some FAQs on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the TypeScript Community Discord at  on March 13th.A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s Pixel Watch Knows When Your Heart Stops Beating</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/heart-attack-smartwatch</link><author>Elissa Welle</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjcwNTY3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Mjg3MTEyOH0.GzE5L4Fb8ueiISIYEvX3bBMzEfsD14la9xuOopm36Mk/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The feature set to roll out in the U.S. this month will call 911 if you can’t]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Use a Metal Pipe Cutter</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di5xVfZ3mtg</link><author>Dad, how do I?</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Di5xVfZ3mtg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:29:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw">Dad, how do I?</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey Kids! 👋🏻👋🏻

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:
1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)
2. Generate Python code to perform their next action
3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)We provide two main evaluation settings:
- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources
- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated mapWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).You'll need:
- Factorio (version 1.1.110)
- Docker
- Python 3.10+The README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with this framework!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to balance paying debt vs. investing</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9vPm615xnY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/a9vPm615xnY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing.

This video is presented by Robinhood. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

These digital documents serve as containers for everything from scientific research to government records, but their rigid formats often trap the data inside, making it difficult for machines to read and analyze."Part of the problem is that PDFs are a creature of a time when print layout was a big influence on publishing software, and PDFs are more of a 'print' product than a digital one," Derek Willis, a lecturer in Data and Computational Journalism at the University of Maryland, wrote in an email to Ars Technica. "The main issue is that many PDFs are simply pictures of information, which means you need Optical Character Recognition software to turn those pictures into data, especially when the original is old or includes handwriting."Computational journalism is a field where traditional reporting techniques merge with data analysis, coding, and algorithmic thinking to uncover stories that might otherwise remain hidden in large datasets, which makes unlocking that data a particular interest for Willis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The State of the Ethereum Blockchain with Andrew Koller</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/03/11/the-state-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-andrew-koller/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-state-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-andrew-koller</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4255543830.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that was created by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood in 2015.

But instead of facing trial in the US, Lee now lives in Dubai, where he’s pitching new crypto products. 

Lee denies any wrongdoing. But crypto industry experts, alleged victims and online “scam hunters” are raising questions about whether regulators in the United Arab Emirates are doing enough to combat crypto fraud as Dubai seeks to position itself as a hub of finance and technology.

On a scorching July day in Dubai, Sam Lee was inside a climate-controlled wine bar, sipping a glass of chilled red, looking untouchable. Near the beginning of the year, US authorities announced that they’d charged Lee with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. They alleged that, as the co-founder of a company called HyperVerse, he’d orchestrated a cryptocurrency scam that bilked investors around the world for almost $2 billion. HyperVerse had promised returns as high as 1% a day via cutting-edge blockchain-based strategies, but according to the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was just an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme. Lee has denied wrongdoing.

This mysterious woman may have been buried this way due to her unconventional lifestyle and suspected undiagnosed illness, which led locals to fear her as an undead threat.

That’s a reality for thousands in Germany, who despite having a job cannot find a place to live. 

Attila Kokas works for the Berlin City Mission as a gardener. Denny Wagner is a cook. At an emergency shelter he prepares food for homeless people. For a few months now, Denny has been spending nights in a small, simple hut with no electricity. Attila sleeps on the street, before he makes his way to work in the early hours. Despite having jobs, both men have been unable to find an affordable apartment in Berlin. They share their fate with quite a few people in Germany. In larger cities in particular, the housing market is tight. This hits people emerging from homelessness and earning low wages especially hard. How can they get away from being without a roof?

The prospect of Washington cutting off support to Kyiv in the face of Russian aggression has prompted European NATO members like Germany, France and the United Kingdom to step up. Europe doesn’t make enough—or in some cases any—of the air-defense systems or long-range rocket artillery that Ukraine relies on like the Patriot and ATACMS.

WSJ breaks down whether European NATO countries have the money, equipment and personnel to fill the gap.

In a demo video Limor 'Ladyada' Fried compares the LLM's command-line interface to working with the build-automation tool CMake or "a weird cross between IRC and a BBS." The first step was converting a PDF of the hardware's datasheet into text, and Claude Code first displays the appropriate Bash command, while asking "Do you want to proceed?" ("What's nice is that it doesn't make changes, even though it has write access to files in the directory...") Eventually from the data sheet it creates things like an accurate register map, C++ headers, and even license text — and more. 

"We are using it to automate parts of the coding and debugging process for an Arduino-compatible Metro Mini board with an OPT 4048 color sensor," writes ptorrone:
Using Claude Code's shell access, we can compile, upload, and test code in a semi-automated workflow, allowing the LLM to suggest fixes for errors along the way... While the AI isn't perfect for high-level driver development, it's proving VERY useful for tedious debugging and super-fast iterative improvements, bringing hardware automation closer to ...reality. 
In the video Fried describes it like this. "I have a full debugging cycle, where I'm there — I'm like driving the car — but I have this copilot that's telling me where to go..." 

"I feel like I'm getting closer to having a semi-automated way of doing driver development."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Sphinx</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-sphinx</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67c99971fc5f88b98d88db92/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Ny2jz0WJhZWoGFy6wT3sHklkR2Hs2Bbxor5HoXtuSx4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Great Sphinx of Giza is probably the most recognisable statue in the world but it’s also one of the most mysterious...with conflicting stories about who built it and why have circulated since ancient times.

It’s often a long way to travel to see a doctor, and treatment is expensive. But an organization from Germany is providing those affected with orthopedic aids, as well as training specialists.

In Uganda, people with disabilities not only often live in great poverty, there’s also hardly any medical care available to them. For more than 10 years now, an organization from Usingen in the German state of Hesse has been providing people with prostheses and other orthopedic aids. In the small town of Kiyunga near the capital Kampala, ProUganda has set up a center with a modern orthopedic workshop and treatment rooms.
But not everyone can get there: The roads are uneven and it’s difficult for poor families to get to Kiyunga with their children. That’s why the team travels to rural areas in minibuses. In the trunk: wheelchairs, some delivered second-hand from Germany, some bought with donations.
The film accompanies members of the aid organization as they work with patients in Kiyunga, in the workshop and on missions in the region.

ABSTRACT
Randomness is essential for important applications such as the encryption of information. We know computers are bad at generating randomness, therefore much effort has been put into finding strategies to do this reliably and securely. These strategies can range from clever, to complex, to just outright silly.

In this talk, we'll cover a research project that aims to answer the question of whether an ant colony can serve as a source for seeding OpenSSL's random number generator. The process, challenges, and findings will be candidly discussed, with something in this presentation for everyone to take away. [...]

But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.However, as Forbes analyst David Ax writes , the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My 16-month theanine self-experiment</title><link>https://dynomight.net/theanine/</link><author>dynm</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet theanine. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I linked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Axiom Space and Red Hat Will Bring Edge Computing to the International Space Station</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/03/08/205225/axiom-space-and-red-hat-will-bring-edge-computing-to-the-international-space-station?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 22:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Axiom Space and Red Hat will collaborate to launch Data Center Unit-1 (AxDCU-1) to the International Space Station this spring. It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. 

"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox," reports the Register.
 Axiom Space said: "The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity." 

Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: "Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency...." 

The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... "AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years." 
The article notes that HPE has also "sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers — commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers — over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions." (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) "At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program." 

Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to "reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis."

By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. 
The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup & disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.

We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The coronavirus pandemic and its consequences | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oVToMh110U</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0oVToMh110U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 17:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Covid-19 was officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.

To many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. 

The public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn’t see his family for months so as not to infect them.

When the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.

By now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aurélie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aurélie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.

As the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?

It's initially available on Pixel devices running Android 15 but will be expanded to "all sufficiently robust Android phones" when Android 16 arrives later this year," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: Today, Linux is only available on the latest Pixel devices running Android 15. When Android 16 arrives later this year, it's expected that all sufficiently robust Android phones will be able to run Linux. Besides a Linux terminal, beta tests have already shown that you should be able to run desktop Linux programs from your phone -- games like Doom, for example. The Linux Terminal runs on top of a Debian Linux virtual machine. This enables you to access a shell interface directly on your Android device. And that just scratches the surface of Google's Linux Terminal. It's actually a do-it-all app that enables you to download, configure, and run Debian. Underneath Terminal runs the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). These are the APIs that enable Android devices to run other operating systems.
 
To try the Linux Terminal app, you must activate Developer Mode by navigating to Settings - About Phone and tapping the build number seven times. I guess Google wants to make sure you want to do this. Once Developer Mode is enabled, the app can be activated via Settings - System - Developer options - Linux development environment. The initial setup may take a while because it needs to download Debian. Typically this is a 500MB download. Once in place, it allows you to adjust disk space allocation, set port controls for network communication, and recover the virtual machine's storage partition. However, it currently lacks support for graphical user interface (GUI) applications. For that, we'll need to wait for Android 16.
 
According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, 'Google wants to turn Android into a proper desktop operating system, and in order to do that, it has to make it work better with traditional PC input methods and display options. Therefore, Google is now testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Strange Way We&apos;re Still Fighting The Black Death | Save Our Species | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMD_Dpvy3TU</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qMD_Dpvy3TU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:01:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Black Plague is still around today, and whilst it's incredibly rare that it affects humans, it can be a huge threat to animals. The good news is there is a vaccine, and much like getting your dog to take a tablet, peanut butter seems to be the key to getting animals to eat it.

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products, including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram (trailer) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xydLuigooY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_xydLuigooY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:23:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigate how an online network known as Terrorgram spread extremism and violence.

Their system tackles some types of abstract pattern-matching tasks using only the puzzles themselves, challenging conventional wisdom about how machine-learning systems acquire problem-solving abilities."Can lossless information compression by itself produce intelligent behavior?" ask Isaac Liao, a first-year PhD student, and his advisor, Professor Albert Gu, from CMU's Machine Learning Department. Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created CompressARC and published the results in a comprehensive post on Liao's website.The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine-learning researcher François Chollet to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills.

22-year-old Billie Carlton’s death caused shockwaves across the nation, adding fuel to a growing moral panic about sex, scandal and drugs.

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation. Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately 90% of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing Mistral OCR. Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API  at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite la Plateforme, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.State of the art understanding of complex documentsNatively multilingual and multimodalDoc-as-prompt, structured outputSelectively available to self-host for organizations dealing with highly sensitive or classified informationState of the art understanding of complex documentsMistral OCR excels in understanding complex document elements, including interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting. The model enables deeper understanding of rich documents such as scientific papers with charts, graphs, equations and figures. Below is an example of the model extracting text as well as imagery from a given PDF into a markdown file. You can access the notebook here. Below we have side-by-side comparisons of PDFs and their respective OCR's outputs. Hover the slider  to switch between input and output. Mistral OCR has consistently outperformed other leading OCR models in rigorous benchmark tests. Its superior accuracy across multiple aspects of document analysis is illustrated below. We extract embedded images from documents along with text. The other LLMs compared below, do not have that capability. For a fair comparison, we evaluate them on our internal “text-only” test-set containing various publication papers, and PDFs from the web; below:Since Mistral’s founding, we have aspired to serve the world with our models, and consequently strived for multilingual capabilities across our offerings. Mistral OCR takes this to a new level, being able to parse, understand, and transcribe thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents. This versatility is crucial for both global organizations that handle documents from diverse linguistic backgrounds, as well as hyperlocal businesses serving niche markets.Fuzzy Match in GenerationBeing lighter weight than most models in the category, Mistral OCR performs significantly faster than its peers, processing up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node. The ability to rapidly process documents ensures continuous learning and improvement even for high-throughput environments.Doc-as-prompt, structured outputMistral OCR also introduces the use of documents as prompts, enabling more powerful and precise instructions. This capability allows users to extract specific information from documents and format it in structured outputs, such as JSON. Users can chain extracted outputs into downstream function calls and build agents. See this example notebook. Available to self-host on a selective basisFor organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, Mistral OCR offers a self-hosting option. This ensures that sensitive or classified information remains secure within your own infrastructure, providing compliance with regulatory and security standards. If you would like to explore self-deployment with us, please let us know.We are empowering our beta customers to elevate their organizational knowledge by transforming their extensive document repositories into actions and solutions. Some of the key use cases where our technology is making a significant impact include:Digitizing scientific research: Leading research institutions have been experimenting with Mistral OCR to convert scientific papers and journals into AI-ready formats, making them accessible to downstream intelligence engines. This has facilitated measurably faster collaboration and accelerated scientific workflows.Preserving historical and cultural heritage: Organizations and nonprofits that are custodians of heritage have been using Mistral OCR to digitize historical documents and artifacts, ensuring their preservation and making them accessible to a broader audience.Streamlining customer service: Customer service departments are exploring Mistral OCR to transform documentation and manuals into indexed knowledge, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.Making literature across design, education, legal, etc. AI ready: Mistral OCR has also been helping companies convert technical literature, engineering drawings, lecture notes, presentations, regulatory filings and much more into indexed, answer-ready formats, unlocking intelligence and productivity across millions of documents.Mistral OCR capabilities are free to try on le Chat. To try the API, head over to la Plateforme. We’d love to get your feedback; expect the model to continue to get even better in the weeks to come. As part of our strategic engagement programs, we will also offer on-premises deployment on a selective basis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Would the Carboniferous Smell Like?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re0EZfNVtV0</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/re0EZfNVtV0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 17:15:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

--

Two species of Demodex mites specifically inhabit human follicles. And not just some people’s— nearly everyone is thought to host mites. One person’s face might harbor hundreds or even thousands of individual mites. On any given day, these microscopic arachnids are probably eating, mating, and laying eggs inside your pores. So, is this… okay? M. Alejandra Perotti investigates.

That’s not new.

Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

I discuss the pathways through which the brain and body interact to produce thyroid hormone and growth hormone, and how these hormones influence essential processes like tissue growth and repair, body composition, and energy production. I explain how thyroid hormone levels are influenced by key nutrients, such as iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine. I also explain how practices such as exercise, sleep, meditation and sauna can offset age-related declines in growth hormone, to optimize overall hormone health and metabolism. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

The game's main conceit was based loosely on the Chinese literary classic The Water Margin: A young outcast and his friends gather up companions to form the 108 Stars of Destiny, building a magnificent rebel outpost and eventually toppling a wicked empire. Suikoden's success would inspire multiple sequels, including immediate follow-up Suikoden II, regarded by many as a shining gem in the PS1's RPG library.With fame and acclaim, however, comes a price tag: Original copies of Suikoden II run in the hundreds of dollars, and that's even with several well-known, game-breaking bugs that were inadvertently introduced in the English version. Here's where Konami seemingly swoops in to the rescue, offering both Suikoden I and II together for a low price and promising beautiful new HD graphics and bonus features. This was announced back in 2022, and now, two and a half years later due to delays, we finally have Suikoden I&II HD Remaster--and I'm left wondering just how all that time this remaster spent cooking in the oven was spent.First, let's talk a bit about the games themselves. I first played both of these titles back on the PS1 many years ago. The original Suikoden was the game I was most excited to revisit, as it had been well over two decades since I'd last played it, and I'd forgotten so much about it. I was pleased to rediscover a pleasant, breezy RPG with a fast-paced story, smooth turn-based combat, and a charming sense of humor. It's quite short, and with the lack of load times and addition of battle speed-up options, you can easily finish it in around 15-20 hours doing all of the optional content.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Women Will NEVER Understand This…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDi-9vRhk6g</link><author>Can I Vibe With Y&apos;all Podcast</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kDi-9vRhk6g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3e_jup9vZsAD1keIkZ51A">Podcast - Can I Vibe with Y&apos;all</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don’t forget to drop a like, comment, and Subscribe  ~d(-_-)b~

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Two Dogs Arguing in Back Seat of The Car! #shorts by RxCKSTxR</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ZRnFA0bZo</link><author>RxCKSTxR</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/G0ZRnFA0bZo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 14:30:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnE9NodOn_dguyg5_yZXwQ">RxCKSTxR</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI revolution is here.

But this isn’t just a story about technology—it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).

For a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now—about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do—are already changing the world.
The people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next – or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as “the magic intelligence in the sky.” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.

But whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

Secrets from the massively popular Stanford business school course on interpersonal hygiene.

Carole Robin and David Bradford taught the most popular elective course at the Stanford Graduate School of Business for a combined total of 75 years. Officially, the name of the course is Interpersonal Dynamics, but everybody calls it “Touchy-Feely.” Together they have written the new book, Connect: Building Exceptional Relationships with Family, Friends, and Colleagues.

We dive into the six hallmarks of what they call “exceptional relationships,” how to be honest and vulnerable without overdoing it, why the questions “how am I feeling?” and “how are you feeling?” are central to improving our communication, the inevitability of risk when you set out to deepen a relationship, and why meditation is helpful in all of this.

This episode originally aired in 2021.

The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn’t have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.

We visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.

More on Ancient Roman Fast Food
Shopping at outdoor markets, like the Campo de' Fiori in Rome, was also a major part of daily life. Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.

For those who couldn’t afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas—multi-story buildings in Rome—relied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.

Fish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neil &amp; a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kf4NyRbvkmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 18:54:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

We begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.

Fusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches—from Princeton’s tokamak designs to Livermore’s laser-driven experiments—and why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.

But fusion isn’t just about energy—it’s also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.

Finally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs? All this and more in a charged-up episode of StarTalk!

--

Achinpur was on the precipice of demonic takeover. A mysterious woman beguiled the king and infiltrated the royal family. But she wasn’t human; under her beautiful façade lurked an insatiable appetite for flesh. One night, the demon queen devoured the king's sons — but the princes managed to evade death. Malay Bera shares the tale of their quest to free the kingdom from the scourge of demons.

Lesson by Malay Bera, directed by Ahmad Thabit, Samaka Studio.

Although this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, "Neelkamal and Lalkamal",  from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.

It's the type of game that will have you setting your controller aside to wipe away tears, both of laughter and raw emotion, as well as to call literally everyone in close proximity to come see whatever dark, hilarious, referential, or mind-blowing thing just happened. As such, I've spent the better part of the past week impatiently waiting for this embargo to drop--for the second I could talk about it with someone other than the close friend I roped into joining me. In short, Split Fiction is one of the most memorable, brilliant, and spectacular games I've ever played. And at long last, I am allowed to tell about it.With Split Fiction, Hazelight Studios solidifies itself as not only one of the most clever and innovative working studios, but as one eager to grow and utterly devoted to creativity as both an idea and act. Though Hazelight has yet to release anything less than great, it was almost shocking to see how much it had learned from--and improved upon--2021's critical darling It Takes Two. Levels and environments are vast, gorgeous, and varied; our two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are full of depth, charm, and personality; the game's seemingly endless gimmicks and gameplay mechanics, all of which are introduced at far more rapid pace than It Takes Two, are nearly all so fun, brilliant, and tightly designed that they could stand alone; and its writing, plot beats, and overall structure deliver a remarkable story that rappels from heart wrenching, commentative, darkly humorous, and brimming with joy just as fluidly as our heroines grapple-hook between buildings. Though there is a level of cheesiness that coats the game's overarching story and its primary antagonist, Rader, as a whole Split Fiction is a marvelous game that sets a new benchmark not only for Hazelight, but for co-op experiences as a whole.Despite its inevitable greatness, Split Fiction kicks off with a humble (if slightly cliched) beginning in which it introduces its protagonists: Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster. Mio and Zoe are nothing alike. Whereas Mio is an angsty, city-slicking, sci-fi enthusiast who'd sooner yank out her own tooth than open up to a stranger, the fantasy-loving Zoe is sunshine incarnate. And yet, the pair does share one thing in common: They are both unpublished writers in dire need of money and a byline.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Niche Do Humans Occupy?

The ports collection will download the KSH source code, compile it, and install it on the system. The pkg method is easier, and it will download a pre-compiled binary package. Hence, it is recommended for all users. KornShell (KSH) has a long history, and many older Unix systems and scripts rely on it. As a result, KSH remains relevant for maintaining and supporting legacy infrastructure. Large enterprises, especially those with established Unix-based systems, continue to use KSH for scripting and system administration tasks. Some industries where KSH is still commonly used include finance and telecommunications. While Bash has become the dominant shell in many Linux distributions, KSH still holds a significant presence in Unix-like environments, particularly in legacy systems. Therefore, installing KSH and practicing with it is worthwhile if you plan to work in such environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Sunlight Protects Against Flu</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6zNt7HUCrY</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/p6zNt7HUCrY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 21:24:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dr. Roger Seheult discuses how the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided valuable scientific insights by occurring outside the typical winter flu season, allowing Harvard researchers to analyze data across various environmental conditions and ultimately conclude that sunlight strongly protects against getting influenza.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JavaScript fatigue strikes back (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/134</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/134/changelog-news-134.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Allen Pike on the JavaScript ecosystem after a decade away, Lars Wirzenius was there at the birth of Linux, Piotr Migdał archives things in Markdown, Jacob Stopak is gamifying Git with Devlands & Juan Diego Rodríguez runs down how CSS functions (will) work.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

We discuss how IFS views the mind as a collection of parts, each shaped by different life experiences—both good and bad, including trauma. To demonstrate how IFS works, Dr. Schwartz guides Dr. Huberman and you, the listener, through an example IFS session. We also explore how IFS and body awareness can help break harmful thought and behavior patterns, promote emotional healing, and build healthier relationships.

A stream refers to a source or destination for bytes. In other words, sed can read its input from standard input (stdin), apply the specified edits to the stream, and automatically output the results to standard output (stdout). Sed syntax allows an input file to be specified on the command line. However, the syntax does not directly support output file specification; this can be achieved through output redirection or editing files in place while making a backup of the original copy optionally. Sed is one of the most powerful tools on Linux and Unix-like systems. Learning it is worthwhile, so in this tutorial, we will start with the sed command syntax and examples.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can TrapC Fix C and C++ Memory Safety Issues?</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/03/0654205/can-trapc-fix-c-and-c-memory-safety-issues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["TrapC, a fork of the C language, is being developed as a potential solution for memory safety issues that have hindered the C and C++ languages," reports InfoWorld. 
But also being developed is a compiler named trapc "intended to be implemented as a cybersecurity compiler for C and C++ code, said developer Robin Rowe..."

 Due by the end of this year, trapc will be a free, open source compiler similar to Clang... Rowe said. TrapC has pointers that are memory-safe, addressing the memory safety issue with the two languages. With TrapC, developers write in C or C++ and compile in TrapC, for memory safety... 
Rowe presented TrapC at an ISO C meeting this week. Developers can download a TrapC whitepaper and offer Rowe feedback. According to the whitepaper, TrapC's memory management is automatic and cannot leak memory. Pointers are lifetime-managed, not garbage-collected. Also, TrapC reuses a few code safety features from C++, notably member functions, constructors, destructors, and the new keyword. 

"TrapC Memory Safe Pointers will not buffer overrun and will not segfault," Rowe told the ISO C Committee standards body meeting, according to the Register. "When C code is compiled using a TrapC compiler, all pointers become Memory Safe Pointers and are checked."
 
In short, TrapC "is a programming language forked from C, with changes to make it LangSec and Memory Safe," according to that white paper. "To accomplish that, TrapC seeks to eliminate all Undefined Behavior in the C programming language..." 

"The startup TRASEC and the non-profit Fountain Abode have a TrapC compiler in development, called trapc," the whitepaper adds, and their mission is "to enable recompiling legacy C code into executables that are safe by design and secure by default, without needing much code refactoring... The TRASEC trapc cybersecurity compiler with AI code reasoning is expected to release as free open source software sometime in 2025." 

In November the Register offered some background on the origins of TrapC...

They discuss the trade-offs between generic and specialized agents, with Dmitri noting the need for a balance between scalability and precision. Chiara highlights how agents can dynamically blend both approaches, while Steven predicts specialized agents will dominate initially before trust in generic agents grows. The panel also examines how e-commerce platforms may resist but eventually collaborate with AI agents. Trust remains a key factor in adoption, with opportunities emerging for new agent-driven business models.

"The February numbers show a staggering 0.61% drop to Linux use..." reports Phoronix. But they attribute this to an sampling error:
According to the survey, it shows 50% of Steam users using the Simplified Chinese language pack [a 20% increase from the month before]. In prior months where there has been drops to Linux use, it's been correlated to wild swings in the Chinese use on Steam. This looks to be another such month. 
Of the Linux specific data, SteamOS continues to prove most popular for that Valve distribution powering the Steam Deck [at 34.67%, with Arch Linux coming in second at 9.7%]. 
AMD CPUs power around 70% of the Linux gaming systems thanks to the Steam Deck APU and AMD Ryzen being quite popular with Linux enthusiasts.

That’s also true, but it has the greatest power to positively impact your mitochondria. There’s also evidence that it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels in both men and women.

Every time I talk about this, people say, “There’s no sun here.” Unless you live in a cave, there’s sun. But it is true that on overcast days, long-wavelength light is filtered out.

It’s still important to get sunlight in your eyes on those days for circadian rhythm regulation. On overcast days, as well as when you need more mitochondrial stimulation, red light devices can be useful. Most of them emit both red light and infrared or near-infrared light.

Full disclosure: Joovv is a sponsor of tge Huberman Lab podcast because, to my knowledge, those are the only medical-grade red and infrared light devices that are commercially available.

One of the really cool things about long-wavelength light, regardless of the source, is that it can penetrate deep into the skin and scatter as much as 8 cm.

In this post, I talk about how to avoid excess UV exposure while still getting plenty of long-wavelength light from the sun.

I did an entire episode about light—Episode 4 of the Huberman Lab podcast. The episode out now with Roger Seheult, M.D., also covers this in detail, including how red light can improve blood glucose regulation.

The last point is that photobiomodulation is now considered a core component of dermatology and other fields of medicine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Munch Painted This Dog</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVV2Qj4H08</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ueVV2Qj4H08?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 15:10:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/Qx2gaq9T

Though the package has been removed from PyPI, researchers at security platform Socket.dev say it enabled "coordinated, unauthorized music downloads from Deezer — a popular streaming service founded in France in 2007."

Although automslc, which has been downloaded over 100,000 times, purports to offer music automation and metadata retrieval, it covertly bypasses Deezer's access restrictions... The package is designed to log into Deezer, harvest track metadata, request full-length streaming URLs, and download complete audio files in clear violation of Deezer's API terms... [I]t orchestrates a distributed piracy operation by leveraging both user-supplied and hardcoded Deezer credentials to create sessions with Deezer's API. This approach enables full access to track metadata and the decryption tokens required to generate full-length track URLs. 

Additionally, the package routinely communicates with a remote server... to update download statuses and submit metadata, thereby centralizing control and allowing the threat actor to monitor and coordinate the distributed downloading operation. In doing so, automslc exposes critical track details — including Deezer IDs, International Standard Recording Codes, track titles, and internal tokens like MD5_ORIGIN (a hash used in generating decryption URLs) — which, when collected en masse, can be used to reassemble full track URLs and facilitate unauthorized downloads... 

Even if a user pays for access to the service, the content is licensed, not owned. The automslc package circumvents licensing restrictions by enabling downloads and potential redistribution, which is outside the bounds of fair use... 
"The malicious package was initially published in 2019, and its popularity (over 100,000 downloads) indicates wide distribution..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Boats and Planes Are Also Going Electric</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeYySXlo8js</link><author>ColdFusion</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zeYySXlo8js?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 04:58:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A">ColdFusion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join me at Everything Electric 2025.

They'd spotted a Reddit post "detailing how someone took a 27-year-old visual basic EXE file, fed it to Claude 3.7, and watched as it reverse-engineered the program and rewrote it in Python."

It was an old Visual Basic 4 program they had written in 1997. Running a VB4 exe in 2024 can be a real yak-shaving compatibility nightmare, chasing down outdated DLLs and messy workarounds. So! OP decided to upload the exe to Claude 3.7 with this request: 
"Can you tell me how to get this file running? It'd be nice to convert it to Python."> 
Claude 3.7 analyzed the binary, extracted the VB 'tokens' (VB is not a fully-machine-code-compiled language which makes this task a lot easier than something from C/C++), identified UI elements, and even extracted sound files. Then, it generated a complete Python equivalent using Pygame. According to the author, the code worked on the first try and the entire process took less than five minutes... 
Torrone speculates on what this might mean. "Old business applications and games could be modernized without needing the original source code... Tools like Claude might make decompilation and software archaeology a lot easier: proprietary binaries from dead platforms could get a new life in open-source too." 

And maybe Archive.org could even add an LLM "to do this on the fly!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Egypt Detectives: Ancient Egyptian Mysteries Uncovered</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcdpsRucdno</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LcdpsRucdno?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Mar 2025 22:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join archaeologist Miriam Cooke and Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat in Egypt Detectives, a thrilling documentary series uncovering the mysteries of ancient Egypt.

This week they announced that the CPAN Security Group "was authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)" to assign and manage CVE vulnerability identifications for Perl and CPAN Modules. 

"This is great news!" posted Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman on social media, saying the announcement came "Just in time for my talk about this very topic in a few weeks about how all open source projects should be doing this" at the Linux Foundation Member Summit in Napa, California. And Curl creator Daniel Stenberg posted "I'm with Greg Kroah-Hartman on this: all Open Source projects should become CNAs. Or team up with others to do it." (Also posting "Agreed" to the suggestion was Seth Larson, the Python Software Foundation's security developer-in-residence involved in their successful effort to become a CNA in 2023.) 

444 CNAs have now partnered with the CVE Program, according to their official web site. The announcement from PerlMonks.org:

Years ago, a few people decided during the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS) that it would be a good idea to join forces, ideas and knowledge and start a group to monitor vulnerabilities in the complete Perl ecosystem from core to the smallest CPAN release. The goal was to follow legislation and CVE reports, and help authors in taking actions on not being vulnerable anymore. That group has grown stable over the past years and is now known as CPANSec. 

The group has several focus areas, and one of them is channeling CVE vulnerability issues. In that specific goal, a milestone has been reached: CPANSec has just been authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for Perl and modules on CPAN

So the blog post calls for a "common framework" for "defining specific, measurable criteria for achieving different levels of memory safety assurance." The hope is this gives policy makers "the technical foundation to craft effective policy initiatives and incentives promoting memory safety" leading to "a market in which vendors are incentivized to invest in memory safety." ("Customers will be empowered to recognize, demand, and reward safety.") 

In January the same Google security researchers helped co-write an article noting there are now strong memory-safety "research technologies" that are sufficiently mature: memory-safe languages (including "safer language subsets like Safe Buffers for C++"), mathematically rigorous formal verification, software compartmentalization, and hardware and software protections. (With hardware protections including things like ARM's Memory Tagging Extension and the (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions, or "CHERI", architecture.) Google's security researchers are now calling for "a blueprint for a memory-safe future" — though Importantly, the idea is "defining the desired outcomes rather than locking ourselves into specific technologies." 

Their blog post this week again urges a practical/actionable framework that's commonly understood, but one that supports different approaches (and allowing tailoring to specific needs) while enabling objective assessment:

At Google, we're not just advocating for standardization and a memory-safe future, we're actively working to build it. We are collaborating with industry and academic partners to develop potential standards, and our joint authorship of the recent CACM call-to-action marks an important first step in this process... This commitment is also reflected in our internal efforts. We are prioritizing memory-safe languages, and have already seen significant reductions in vulnerabilities by adopting languages like Rust in combination with existing, wide-spread usage of Java, Kotlin, and Go where performance constraints permit. We recognize that a complete transition to those languages will take time. That's why we're also investing in techniques to improve the safety of our existing C++ codebase by design, such as deploying hardened libc++. 

This effort isn't about picking winners or dictating solutions. It's about creating a level playing field, empowering informed decision-making, and driving a virtuous cycle of security improvement... The journey towards memory safety requires a collective commitment to standardization. We need to build a future where memory safety is not an afterthought but a foundational principle, a future where the next generation inherits a digital world that is secure by design. 
The security researchers' post calls for "a collective commitment" to eliminate memory-safety bugs, "anchored on secure-by-design practices..." One of the blog post's subheadings? "Let's build a memory-safe future together." 

And they're urging changes "not just for ourselves but for the generations that follow."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SOGCast 034: Dale Hanson Pt. 2 — Dale Loses a Finger, Flies Secret Mission</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fjzK_kJSy0</link><author>Jocko Podcast</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_fjzK_kJSy0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 23:58:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqcY4CAuBFNFho6JgygCnA">Jocko Podcast</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More from J.

Join host of Betwixt the Sheets Kate Lister and History Hit’s Dan Snow to talk about post-WW1 London - when a dark underworld of shady characters are soundtracked by an exploding jazz scene, fuelled by a roaring drugs trade.

At the heart of it are the so-called 'dope girls'. Women who fascinated and appalled society in equal measure. 

How did a post war mindset influence the 1920s? How did the press react to all the scandal?  And, who were some of the major players involved?

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Which species would you get rid of? | Ada, Ep. 5</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEFz9KzOB1g</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iEFz9KzOB1g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 16:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ada imagines how eradicating invasive species would impact our ecosystems.

The National Park Service also said it would hire 7,700 seasonal employees - 2,700 more than previously stated. It’s still not enough. Park employees were already struggling to meet the demands of over 325 million annual visitors before the initial downsizing. These two charts show how the staff to visitor ratio was already pushed to the limit, leading to longer lines, shorter operating hours, and a potentially less safe environment for guests. It’s about to get worse.

I describe how the body senses nutrient levels and how the brain processes these signals to stimulate hunger or suppress appetite. I also discuss how certain foods can help curb hunger, while processed foods and emulsifiers can interfere with satiety signals, leading to overeating. Additionally, I cover how lifestyle factors such as exercise and meal timing regulate blood glucose levels, which in turn impact hunger and appetite.

Huberman Lab Essentials episodes are approximately 30 minutes long and focus on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, while our full-length episodes will continue to be released every Monday.

And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity. Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito. Their decisions—some brilliant, others catastrophic—reshaped nations and decided the fate of millions.In this gripping mini-series, Dan steps inside the war room and breaks down the key strategic moves made by these infamous leaders, with the help of Phillips O’Brien (esteemed professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews). They examine Hitler’s fateful invasion of Russia, Churchill’s attempts to preserve the British Empire, as well as Roosevelt’s quiet manoeuvring and Hirohito’s cautious influence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Largest Stolen Art Scandal of the 20th Century | Full Episode | Secrets of the Dead | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTw9RYpRTTs</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kTw9RYpRTTs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 23:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is part 2 of a 2-part series -- Watch part 1 here: https://to.pbs.org/3QtGz2f | #SecretsDeadPBS 
Historian Jonathan Petropoulos investigates former Nazi art dealer Bruno Lohse’s role in post-war America. Lohse established relationships with curators at some of the nation’s most important cultural institutions and became an invisible hand, dealing in looted art – even as the families of the original owners pursued the restitution of works rightfully theirs.

Lost Records is a game that revels in the melodrama and contradictory nature of adolescence. It understands the yearning we all once had to be completely unknowable and one-of-a-kind while also being fully-understood, accepted, and loved. Within its eight or so hours, insecurity and conviction walk hand-in-hand while the assumed invincibility of youth is stretched to its breaking point. How can one summer--how can --feel so everlasting yet utterly fragile? Such is the magic of our teenage years.Lost Records captures this phenomenon stunningly, yet doesn't settle for being a game merely driven entirely by nostalgia or reminders of what it felt like to be young in the '90s. At its core is an eerie, supernatural mystery that spans nearly three decades and threatens to consume the four women involved in it--one that promises violence and the reemergence of events perhaps better left forgotten. This intense, slow-burning narrative provides an excellent framework for an empathetic exploration into girlhood, friendship, sexuality, individuality, expression, and the transition from youth to middle age. All this combined with dynamic characters, cinematic visuals, beautifully-rendered character models, and keen sense of atmosphere makes Lost Records one of Don't Nod's best games to date.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mary, Queen of Scots</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/queen-of-scots-mary</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67bc86d019249d0c1a6d8f00/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=GtxOZiLfcAbHNEsURMPrACCd_6JUDRhfgf4gUf5H13Q" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the story of the incredible rise and fall of Mary, Queen of Scots.

Told through the voices of Hawaiian farmers, fishermen, and activists, the film reveals the impacts of militarization and environmental degradation on this historic land and its waters. Highlighting the revival of Native Hawaiian practices and the ongoing struggle for restoration, the documentary envisions a future where the land and waters of Puʻuloa are once again fertile and thriving.

'HOMEGROWN: A Part Of/Apart From' is a collection of short films from the U.S. territories and Hawaiʻi exploring issues of cultural identity, sovereignty, and agency, as residents and members of the diaspora grapple with what it means to be “a part of and apart from” the mainland U.S.

--

Globally, we produce more than a trillion computer chips every year. Which means about 20 trillion transistors are built every second— and this process is done in fewer than 500 fabrication plants. How do we build so many tiny, intricately-connected devices, so incredibly fast? George Zaidan and Sajan Saini explore how photolithography helps build these devices and its environmental impact.

This January was the hottest ever recorded globally, yet it also snowed in Florida and was icy in Texas? How? Well, global warming might actually be making winter storms colder. It all has to do with the polar jetstream — a boundary of air that’s in flux depending on the differences in temperature around the globe. What effect might climate change be having on it?

Unlike a monolithic system, a distributed system has no central point of control, meaning it must handle challenges like data consistency, network latency, and system failures.Debugging distributed systems is conventionally considered challenging because modern architectures consist of numerous microservices communicating across networks, making failures difficult to isolate. The challenges and maintenance burdens can magnify as systems grow in size and complexity.Julia Blase is a Product Manager at Chronosphere where she works on features to help developers troubleshoot distributed systems more efficiently, including Differential Diagnosis, or DDx. DDx provides tooling to troubleshoot distributed systems, and emphasizes automation and developer experience. In this episode Julia joins Sean Falconer to talk about the challenges and emerging strategies to troubleshoot distributed systems.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored bySean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler.

As a horror fan, it was incredible to place myself in the middle of some iconic imagery from the series. A VR game like Alien: Rogue Incursion offers a similar promise: Immerse yourself in the world of Alien in a way no game has previously allowed--natively anyway, as Alien: Isolation does enjoy some player-made VR mods today. But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, go for a more action-oriented take akin to James Cameron's sequel. That's the first oddity of Rogue Incursion. It's not necessarily beholden to this naming convention, but the game has you spraying-and-praying at so many Xenos that it feels more like an action game than the survival-horror experience you might expect.This is despite the fact that the developers clearly looked toward Alien: Isolation for inspiration, from the look of the androids--which Creative Assembly had introduced to the mythology back in 2014--to the signature movement scanner that you can now physically pull from your inventory in VR. Isolation protagonist Amanda Ripley is even name-dropped at one moment, so it seems Rogue Incursion wants to harken back to its predecessor... until it doesn't.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI killed the tech interview.

But what exactly would you learn? 

Luke Tomes follows in the footsteps of the young men on their ‘grand tour’ of Europe, an educational rite of passage, in which the art of duelling and dancing were very much central to the programme. Challenging Kate Lister to a fencing bout before taking part in a 17th century dance-off, Luke finds out if his gentlemanly skills are up to scratch...

'Royal Favourites' comes to History Hit TV on 27 March 2025.

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists? In addition to a general overview of the Oort Cloud, I’ll address the reasons why some scientists question its existence.

Not just because of the verticality and fluidity it introduced to traversal, but also because of its vital role in combat--whether you were incorporating Silkbind attacks into combos or using the Wire-dash to avoid certain death by the skin of your teeth. The Wirebug was a fantastic addition, and yet its absence is something I never really felt in Monster Hunter Wilds. Such is the strength of its combat, the seamlessness of its open world, and the impact both of these facets have on a core gameplay loop that remains infinitely compelling. There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series.For seasoned veterans, that core gameplay loop will be instantly recognizable. You hunt monsters, craft their parts to make better weapons and armor, and then use these upgrades to hunt even more challenging monsters. It's an evergreen formula, although an emphasis on narrative hasn't always been part of the equation. The lone exception is 2018's Monster Hunter World, and in many ways, Wilds feels like a continuation of that game's approach to storytelling. By integrating Guild and Village quests into one cohesive story with multiple characters and a fully voiced protagonist, Capcom clearly intends for the story to be more than the afterthought it has traditionally been.The game's opening moments see the Hunter's Guild arrive in the Forbidden Lands: an uncharted region believed to be uninhabited for the past thousand-odd years. This misconception changed, however, when a young boy named Nata was discovered near the border. Pensive and frightened, Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a fearsome monster known as the White Wrath, forcing the Hunter's Guild to embark on an expedition to investigate this mysterious creature and potentially save Nata's Indigenous people from annihilation. As a hunter, it's your role to slay a bestiary of monsters and protect the balance of the ecosystem in this dangerous new frontier.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Enhance Your Immune System | Dr. Roger Seheult</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5DAW8mkJ6Y</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N5DAW8mkJ6Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My guest is Dr. Roger Seheult, M.D., a board-certified physician in internal medicine, pulmonary diseases, critical care, and sleep medicine at Loma Linda University.

And this apparently created friction with OBS Studio, the free/open-source screencasting and streaming app. 

"We are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork," OBS Studio lead Joel Bethke posted in on GitLab's page for Fedora Flatpaks. They said they were making "a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution. Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken...." (Issues with Fedora's packaging led "to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package..." Bethke said in his original Issue. "I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds.") 

23 people clicked "Like" on the original Issue — but threatening legal action only happened after Bethke felt Fedora was unresponsive, according to It's FOSS:
In a comment on a video by Brodi Robertson (check pinned comment), Joel shared that folks from Fedora were not taking this issue seriously, with one of them even resorting to name-calling by labeling the OBS Studio devs as being "terrible maintainers". Since then, a major step has been taken by Neal Gompa, a well-known Fedora contributor and member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo). He has opened a new issue to remove Fedora's OBS Studio flatpak from the registry as soon as possible. 
But by Tuesday Bethke posted in a new comment on GitLab announcing that "a very good conversation" with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader seemed to have cleared the tension. "We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are... [T]he OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks." To the issue of not knowing where to report bugs for the downstream package, "We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point." As for other issues with Fedora's Flatpak for OBS Studio, "The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve..." 

And similar sentiments were echoed on Fedora's own issue tracker. "We had a good conversation today, and there is a hopeful path forward that does not require the OBS Project distancing itself from Fedora Flatpaks..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Soho: London&apos;s Most Notorious Neighbourhood</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/soho-londons-most-notorious-neighbourhood</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67b85b7161b0b0034978a439/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=XmRGXDSfjZDg2qWbQDZfaox2_QT4byoFAB_X1QSIGTc" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Soho was once a thriving melting pot of speakeasies, sex work and organised crime.

Joining Dan to discuss the extraordinary history of London’s most notorious neighbourhood in the 1920s is sex historian and host of the Betwixt the Sheets podcast Dr Kate Lister. Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War.

Linux's second-in-command Greg Kroah-Hartman has also been a big proponent of Rust kernel code. He's crafted another Linux kernel mailing list post [Wednesdsay] outlining the benefits of Rust and encouraging new kernel code/drivers to be in Rust rather than C. Greg KH makes the case that the majority of the kernel bugs are due to "stupid little corner cases in C that are totally gone in Rust." 

"As someone who has seen almost EVERY kernel bugfix and security issue for the past 15+ years... and who sees EVERY kernel CVE issued, I think I can speak on this topic," Kroah-Hartman began. Here's some excerpts from his remarks. Citing corner cases like overwrites of memory, error path cleanups, use-after-free mistakes and forgetting to check error values, Kroah-Hartman says he's "all for... making these types of problems impossible to hit."

That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)... [F]or new code / drivers, writing them in Rust where these types of
bugs just can't happen (or happen much much less) is a win for all of
us, why wouldn't we do this...? Rust isn't a "silver bullet" that will solve all of our problems, but it sure will help in a huge number of places, so for new stuff going forward, why wouldn't we want that...? 

Yes, mixed language codebases are rough, and hard to maintain, but we are kernel developers dammit, we've been maintaining and strengthening Linux for longer than anyone ever thought was going to be possible. We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years. We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together. 

Kroah-Hartman emphasized later that "a huge majority of the stupid things we do in C just don't happen in the same code implemented in Rust (i.e. memory leaks, error path cleanups, return value checking, etc.) " 

The complete thread contains over 140 messages — including Linus Torvalds' observation that " #pragma is complete garbage and should never be used."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline TV: 1990 - Everything That Happened In TV In The Year 1990</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KnBL6eq8T8</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8KnBL6eq8T8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to Timeline TV!

Highlights from Torvalds' response:

The fact is, the pull request you objected to DID NOT TOUCH THE DMA LAYER AT ALL. It was literally just another user of it, in a completely separate subdirectory, that didn't change the code you maintain in _any_ way, shape, or form... Honestly, what you have been doing is basically saying "as a DMA maintainer I control what the DMA code is used for". 

And that is not how *any* of this works. What's next? Saying that particular drivers can't do DMA, because you don't like that device, and as a DMA maintainer you control who can use the DMA code? That's _literally_ exactly what you are trying to do with the Rust code. You are saying that you disagree with Rust — which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain... 

You don't have to like Rust. You don't have to care about it. That's been made clear pretty much from the very beginning, that nobody is forced to suddenly have to learn a new language, and that people who want to work purely on the C side can very much continue to do so. So to get back to the very core of your statement: 

 "The document claims no subsystem is forced to take Rust" 

that is very much true. You are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it... 

You can't have it both ways. You can't say "I want to have nothing to do with Rust", and then in the very next sentence say "And that means that the Rust code that I will ignore cannot use the C interfaces I maintain".... So when you change the C interfaces, the Rust people will have to deal with the fallout, and will have to fix the Rust bindings. That's kind of the promise here: there's that "wall of protection" around C developers that don't want to deal with Rust issues in the promise that they don't *have* to deal with Rust. 

But that "wall of protection" basically goes both ways. If you don't want to deal with the Rust code, you get no *say* on the Rust code. Put another way: the "nobody is forced to deal with Rust" does not imply "everybody is allowed to veto any Rust code".
 
Torvalds also made sure to add some kind remarks, including "I respect you technically, and I like working with you."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Challenge with Voice Agents</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Challenge-with-Voice-Agents-e2v7kj7</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98865191/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-22%2F395336812-44100-2-5e30b9d18237d.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:50:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode Two, Demetrios, Paul, and Floris explore the latest in Voice AI agents.

But Cabernet dares to go deeper with its message, delving into the cyclical nature of humanity's cruelty to each other, especially regarding the treatment of the lower class, and how society's many ills are often the result of the new rich inheriting the evils of the old. It all makes for a deeply compelling consequence-driven story where every choice carries the potential to surprise you with terrifying force. Some late-game glitches mar the game's fantastic conclusion, but even if developer Party for Introverts doesn't address those issues in post-launch updates, the journey to get to Cabernet's final hour is an incredible piece of interactive fiction.A 2D narrative-driven RPG set in 19th century Eastern Europe, Cabernet begins with protagonist Liza's funeral, as you briefly roleplay as her uncle and give a eulogy that determines the direction of Liza's life and which skills she specializes in. Control then shifts to Liza as you awake in a dungeon. Unsure of how she got there, Liza makes a pact with an unseen and silent presence for freedom, before finding herself at a party filled with vampires. It quickly becomes apparent that she is now a vampire as well, and this new life comes with a ton of rules, like needing to satiate a constant thirst for blood and staying away from sunlight. But there are immense freedoms associated with the transformation as well, as Liza is empowered with supernatural abilities that allow her to go to places she never could before, get away with acts others are often swiftly arrested for, and pursue passions and love most mortals of her station cannot yet readily do.In this sense, Liza is a stand-in for the middle class, which was emerging during this period in real-life history. Liza cannot relate to the centuries-old Countess who commands all the vampires in the region and lives in a mansion filled with wealth, nor can she completely empathize with the poor farmer girl who dreams of learning music and bettering herself but must toil away in the fields for hours so her family can eat. But Liza can take small steps into both of their worlds to see their respective trials and tribulations, and although she cannot fundamentally change the relationship between the poor and rich, she is one of the few in town who can affect the lives of people in both social spheres. This setup grounds the otherwise supernatural fantasy in real-world politics, implementing considerations into the story that give even the simplest of choices substantial narrative weight.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Build Strength &amp; Endurance</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkFHdXo1O0w</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rkFHdXo1O0w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:38:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pavel Tsatsouline is one of the world’s top authorities on building strength, endurance, and flexibility.

We discussed a topic that I believe isn’t covered enough: how to get strong without necessarily adding muscle size. Many people don’t want to be much bigger, but most everybody wants endurance. It’s possible to train for both simultaneously. It also turns out that training for strength with low repetitions (two to five reps) is safer than training with high repetitions—if done correctly. That’s because higher repetitions fatigue the stabilizing muscles. Still, there’s a proper way to train heavy, and Pavel explains it.

Hypertrophy training, or training for muscle size, is far more draining to the systemic nervous system than most people realize. So if you struggle with post-workout fatigue or experience brain fog later in the day, you might try training with heavier weights and lower repetitions for a while, focusing on strength instead.

We also discussed the longevity benefits of training for strength and endurance. And for those who want to add muscle size, Pavel explains shorter workouts that can be used to augment a strength program while minimizing inroads to recovery.

Additionally, we covered how to build flexibility, all with minimal time investment. Pavel is a true expert and a no-frills instructor. There’s something for everyone in this episode—it definitely applies to both women and men.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline: TV - The 90s (Teaser Trailer)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca8eN9CXqc0</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ca8eN9CXqc0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Coming soon!

Jason Wilson faced many challenges growing up-the types of challenges that make many men turn down the wrong path-the demonic path that destroys people and ruins their souls. But, Jason was able to break away from that path-and get on another path: the Righteous Path...and he has helped thousands of people do the same through his books: Cry Like a Man, Battle Cry, and his most recent book, The Man the Moment Demands: Master the Ten Characteristics of the Comprehensive Man. He is an author, the founder and director of The Cave of Adullam Transformational Academy, Star of the Lawrence Fishburne-produced documentary, called The Cave of Adullam, he is a lifelong martial artist, and he is a husband and father.

How did the universe begin? How can something come from nothing? One way to “solve” this most difficult of philosophical conundrums is to avoid it altogether. Maybe the universe didn’t begin. Maybe the Big Bang was just one in an endless cycle.
