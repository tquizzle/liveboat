"We didn't just want to build a company that makes the current crop of creators 10 percent faster or makes it 10 percent easier to make music. If you want to impact the way a billion people experience music you have to build something for a billion people," Shulman said on the 20VC podcast. "And so that is first and foremost giving everybody the joys of creating music and this is a huge departure from how it is now. It's not really enjoyable to make music now [...] It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people don't enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music."
 
Suno AI works like other popular generative AI tools, allowing users to generate music by writing text prompts describing the kind of music they want to hear. Also like many other generative AI tools, Suno was trained on heaps of copyrighted music it fed into its training dataset without consent, a practice Suno is currently being sued for by the recording industry. In the interview, Shulman says he's disappointed that the recording industry is suing his company because he believes Suno and other similar AI music generators will ultimately allow more people to make and enjoy music, which will only grow the audience and industry, benefiting everyone. That may end up being true, and could be compared to the history of electronic music, digital production tools, or any other technology that allowed more people to make more music.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

A US appeals court upheld the law in April 2024, reversing the ruling of a district judge who blocked it in 2021. The Supreme Court last month decided not to hear the broadband industry's challenge, leaving the appeals court ruling in place. The state law requires Internet providers to offer $15- or $20-per-month service to people with low incomes.
 
As we've written, the battle between New York and ISPs was an important test case for how states can regulate broadband providers when the Federal Communications Commission isn't doing so. The Biden-era FCC's attempt to reinstate net neutrality rules and regulate broadband providers as common carriers was blocked in court, but ISPs lost the fight against the New York affordability law and an earlier fight against California's net neutrality law.
 
New York-based ISPs can comply by offering $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds. The price must include "any recurring taxes and fees such as recurring rental fees for service provider equipment required to obtain broadband service and usage fees." Price increases are to be capped at 2 percent per year, and state officials will periodically review whether minimum required speeds should be raised. New York Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian last week issued an order stating that the law will take effect on January 15. "On December 16, 2024, the United States Supreme Court denied the Plaintiff's request for further review," the order said. "As part of the litigation, the [New York attorney general] agreed not to enforce the ABA [Affordable Broadband Act] until 30 days after the date when the US Supreme Court decided the writ of Certiorari. Thus, the ABA will once again take effect and may be enforced in New York on January 15, 2025." The order said it plans to implement the law quickly because of "developments at the federal level impacting the affordability of broadband service."
 
ISPs can receive one-month exemptions by filing paperwork by Wednesday confirming they meet the subscriber threshold, notes Ars. To secure longer-term exemptions, ISPs must submit detailed financial information by February 15.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Anexia was founded in 2006, is based in Austria, and provides cloud services from over 100 locations around the world by placing equipment in third party datacenters. Clients include remote access and control vendor TeamViewer, and airline Lufthansa -- plus plenty more outfits that need reliable hosting and service to match.
 
CEO Alexander Windbichler told The Register that after Broadcom acquired VMware, increased licensing costs, and made big changes to its partner program, Anexia remained eligible to operate a VMware-powered cloud. But Windbichler felt he couldn't afford to continue, because Broadcom offered new terms that saw the cost of VMware licenses rise sharply. The CEO preferred not to enumerate the increase precisely however The Register understands it exceeded 500 percent. Whatever the actual figure, Windbichler said the cost increase "Would have been existential for us."
 
"We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears," he said. "With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract." That arrangement, the CEO said, would have created extreme stress on company cashflow. "We would not be able to compete with the market," he said. "We had customers on contracts, and they would not pay for a price increase." Windbichler considered legal action, but felt the fight would have been slow and expensive. Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Fears of water contamination have prompted advisories to boil drinking water or turn to bottled supplies, and anxious residents are tracking fires through live TV and the Watch Duty app.
Chaos and confusion are rampant, with evacuation orders and warnings issued, schools closed, and residents navigating false information about resources and dealing with the long-term consequences of the disaster.  Leslie Kaufman, Bloomberg Climate Reporter, joins Bloomberg Intelligence to discuss what this will mean for insurers in the area.

This means one person won't have control over the entire project. The organization is trying to differentiate itself from social networks controlled by CEOs like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. While exact details are yet to be finalized, this means that Mastodon's current CEO and creator, Eugen Rochko, will hand over management bits of the organization to the new entity and focus on the product strategy.
 
The organization said that it will continue to host the mastodon.social and mastodon.online servers, which users can sign up for and join the ActivityPub-based network. Mastodon currently has 835,000 monthly active users spread across thousands of servers. [...] Last year, the company formed a U.S.-based nonprofit to get more funds and grants with Twitter co-founder Biz Stone on the board. At the same time, the organization lost its nonprofit status in Germany. [...] The blog post noted that the new Europe-based nonprofit entity will wholly own the Mastodon GmbH for-profit entity. The organization is in the process of finalizing the place where the new entity will be set up. "We are taking the time to select the appropriate jurisdiction and structure in Europe. Then we will determine which other (subsidiary) legal structures are needed to support operations and sustainability,&#226; Mastodon said in a blog post. "Throughout, we will focus on establishing the appropriate governance and leadership frameworks that reflect the nature and purpose of Mastodon as a whole, and responsibly serve the community."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Mozambique has experienced deadly unrest since last October's disputed election. The security forces have been accused of using excessive force against demonstrators, who say the vote was rigged. President-elect Daniel Chapo has called for calm ahead of his inauguration on Wednesday, and the opposition has called for a strike in protest.  Chapo's Frelimo party has been in power for fifty years.

Air raid sirens have long become part of everyday life in the Ukrainian city. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion into Ukraine in February 2022, residents took shelter underground. Early on in the crisis, subway stations were converted to schools and theaters relocated underground. Today, there are even plans to construct a subterranean recreational park. What does everyday life look like in a war-torn city? Carolina Chimoy visited Kharkiv to find out.

The most underrated social skill is so subtle it often goes unnoticed‚Äîbut it has the power to change lives, including yours. In this video, I reveal the transformative art of "holding space," a skill that's not about fixing, advising, or encouraging, but simply being present for someone in their moments of vulnerability.

Through Theo Von's deeply empathetic interaction with Sean Strickland, who shares harrowing stories of his past, we explore how this skill can create profound connections. You'll learn to recognize dissociation, switch conversational modes, and offer support without an agenda.


0:00 - Intro
0:11 - Here is the skill
0:46  - Disconnected emotions
1:32 - The underlying emotions break through
1:57 - Switch conversational modes
3:49 - Just listen
4:45 - Encourage emotional exploration

The European Commission sent questionnaires to developers in December focusing on Apple's new "core technology fee" of $0.51 per app installation, part of its compliance with EU's Digital Markets Act. Under Apple's revised structure, developers can maintain existing terms with commissions up to 30% on app sales, or choose a new model with lower commission rates but additional charges.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

With elections coming up in six weeks, how much would any new government have to spend to fix these issues?  
In their published election manifestos, all parties suggest tax cuts that would shrink government income overall. While CDU/CSU, FDP and AfD only propose tax cuts, the SPD and Greens propose small tax increases on wealth and inheritance. The parties are split on the constitutionally enshrined debt-brake. CDU/CSU, FDP and AfD want to adhere to the rule, while SPD and Greens have suggested changing the rule and debt-financing infrastructure spending.

At software firm TS Imagine, AI-powered email sorting saves 4,000 work hours annually at 3% of employee costs, while Palantir reported AI reduced future headcount needs by 10-15%, according to company executives. 

The trend is most pronounced in software development and customer service sectors, where companies are deferring or scaling back hiring plans, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran. This shift comes as long-term unemployment in the U.S. has risen more than 50% since late 2022, though tech sector unemployment dropped to 2% in December.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies are everywhere now, being applied in a wide range of industries. From finance to supply chain management, these technologies are driving innovation and reshaping how businesses and individuals interact. The adaptability of DLT has also caught the attention of governments worldwide, inspiring them to create platforms tailored to their unique needs and visions for the future.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Across the globe, numerous cities and their governments have developed their own crypto projects and platforms.</strong> Each location brings its own approach, shaped by local expertise, culture, and economic priorities. These initiatives demonstrate how diverse applications of this technology can address region-specific challenges while contributing to the broader development of decentralized solutions.</p>
<p>\
We‚Äôll explore some of these projects ahead.</p>
<h2 id="bondsinquincy">Bonds in Quincy</h2>
<p>In April 2024, the City of Quincy, Massachusetts, became the first U.S. municipality to issue bonds using DLT. A bond, in this context, is like a loan from investors to the city. The city borrows money to fund public projects, and in return, it promises to pay the investors back over time with interest. Collaborating with the bank JP Morgan and leveraging its private chain Onyx Digital Assets, Quincy raised $10 million through a seven-year bond issuance.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.211Z-gv097jetkp2d4udbidw48hvz" alt="Quincy Market in Boston, Massachusetts" title="right-50" /></p>
<p><strong>Quincy <strong><a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/massachusetts-municipality-issues-bond-via-blockchain-in-us-public-sector-first/">used this technology</a></strong> to simplify and modernize the bond process, making it more transparent and efficient.</strong> This innovation is part of the city's effort to ‚Äúdemocratize‚Äù its finances, making them more transparent and efficient. Besides, now it‚Äôs easier for everyday residents to participate in funding and benefiting from local projects.</p>
<p>\
The issuance was smaller than Quincy‚Äôs typical bond sizes, but it served as a proof of concept to explore DLT's potential in simplifying processes like interest payments. This platform, for instance, can allow automatic payments to bondholders and lower costs for all parties involved.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="supplychainindubai">Supply Chain in Dubai</h2>
<p>The government agency responsible for regulating trade, enforcing customs laws, and facilitating the movement of goods in and out of Dubai, Dubai Customs, released a new DLT platform in July 2024. This one will work to improve how goods are tracked and traded within the city and across its borders.</p>
<p>\n  <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.214Z-qs79i5zbrbs07i987cjs0ayl" alt="Downtown Dubai, UAE" title="right-50" /><strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-customs-launches-blockchain-platform-amid-smart-city-effort">Launched</a></strong> as a part of Dubai‚Äôs broader "smart city" initiative, this platform focuses on making supply chains more transparent and reducing delays in customs clearance by simplifying processes.** It also eliminates the need for excessive paperwork by enabling tamper-proof data sharing, which is more secure and reliable.</p>
<p>\
DLT was chosen for this project because of its ability to securely store and share data across multiple locations. This technology is ideal for tracking the movement of goods in real-time, reducing fraud, and ensuring that transactions are trustworthy. By automating many procedures, the platform saves time and effort for everyone involved, from businesses managing shipments to customs officials clearing goods. This makes Dubai‚Äôs trade and logistics environment smoother and more appealing to global partners.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="identityinbuenosaires">Identity in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>In October 2024, Buenos Aires (the capital of Argentina) finally released QuarkID, a digital identity platform powered by DLT, designed to enhance security and privacy for its 3.6 million citizens. <strong>QuarkID, which has been <strong><a href="https://thepaypers.com/digital-identity-security-online-fraud/argentina-adopts-quarkid-for-blockchain-based-citizen-id--1266717">in development</a></strong> the whole year, allows residents to manage personal documents such as birth certificates, tax files, and vaccination records through the city‚Äôs app MiBa.</strong> This new system ensures authenticity without relying on external oversight, marking a major step forward in digital identity innovation.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.215Z-d7jsj80t4evijuaw3viokrk3" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
QuarkID uses DLT to provide secure, tamper-proof data management. The platform uses zero-knowledge cryptography, which enables individuals to share only the specific information needed for each interaction, keeping the rest of their data private. With no intermediaries involved, <strong><a href="https://quarkid.org/">QuarkID</a></strong> facilitates seamless, peer-to-peer document sharing while reducing risks like identity theft and fraud.</p>
<p>\
Buenos Aires plans to expand QuarkID to include more services, such as driver‚Äôs licenses and permits, and is testing its use in other 12 cities in five countries. By adopting this technology for digital identities, Argentina aims to create a more efficient, secure, and cost-effective system, setting an example for other governments to follow.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="cryptoindexinhongkong">Crypto Index in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) made history by launching Asia‚Äôs first EU-regulated crypto index, a major development for the region. Unveiled in November 2024, the index integrates leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether into traditional financial markets. Let's remember that an index is a tool that tracks the value of a group of assets, showing how the prices of those assets change over time. The EU regulation ensures the index is accurate, trustworthy, and follows strict rules. This helps protect investors by making sure the information is reliable and transparent.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.215Z-gv4qd28c3sj0t2n8bcoj5pcp" alt="HKEX Bitcoin Index in Nov 24" /></p>
<p>\
By offering this initiative, <strong><a href="https://coinpaprika.com/news/hong-kong-launches-asia-s-first-eu-regulated-crypto-index/">Hong Kong aims</a></strong> to meet the growing demand for crypto investment opportunities while reinforcing its reputation as a forward-thinking financial hub. The index series calculates the prices of cryptocurrencies using a 24-hour volume-weighted average from major global exchanges. <strong>Updated daily at 4:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time, it provides real-time benchmarks in US dollars, aligning regional crypto standards with international markets.</strong></p>
<p>\
This way, Hong Kong is bridging the gap between traditional finance and the growing world of cryptocurrencies. Now, we can say that HKEX supports the healthy development of the virtual asset market while solidifying its leadership in financial innovation across Asia.</p>

<h2 id="tokenizationinsingapore">Tokenization in Singapore</h2>
<p>The Singapore Monetary Authority (MAS) has been a very active player in DLT over several years. In November 2024, it shared its plans to push the use of tokenization in finance. Tokenization means turning assets like stocks or bonds into digital tokens on a DLT, making them easier to trade. MAS wants to connect financial companies to make buying, selling, and settling tokenized assets smoother and faster.</p>
<p>\n  <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:06.871Z-z06vpfjedzedmwx5l9dvk6r7" alt="" title="left-50" /><strong><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation">This initiative</a></strong> includes forming networks to boost liquidity, developing a supporting ecosystem for digital infrastructure, and enabling access to common settlement facilities for tokenized assets.** Through Project Guardian, over 40 institutions from seven regions are testing tokenization in various markets, including bonds, currencies, and funds.</p>
<p>\
The authority is also expanding its Global Layer One (GL1) initiative, which began in 2023. GL1 aims to create a seamless system for cross-border transactions by ensuring that market infrastructures are compatible. This will help tokenized assets to be traded internationally, with clear governance and risk management guidelines. Besides, MAS is also introducing a common settlement facility to enhance trust in tokenized transactions, using a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) for settlements.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="amultipurposecryptoecosystem">A Multipurpose Crypto Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Of course, there are numerous DLT platforms at this point, but not all of them offer the same features, security, and decentralization levels. <strong><a href="https://obyte.org/">Obyte</a></strong>, as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with a fully decentralized ecosystem, could be a good alternative to build numerous projects ‚Äîindividual or institutional.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Besides, while other DLT platforms have been chosen only for their efficiency, Obyte also empowers users with true freedom by using a decentralized Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) system, eliminating middlemen like miners or validators.</strong> This ensures fast, secure transactions without intermediaries or censorship risks. Beyond that, it‚Äôs a versatile crypto ecosystem, supporting a wide range of features.</p>

I lost three hours of work yesterday because Chrome took a nice ol‚Äô dump while I was editing footage of my friend doing something monumentally stupid with a shopping cart. This wasn't the first time, and it sure as hell won't be the last. But a bit of honest truth - maybe I'm using these tools wrong. Maybe I'm the problem.</p>
<h2 id="aquickrealitycheck">A Quick Reality Check</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uth9XQYwb1eyk2Boeeg37EmS7G82-oq2333l.gif.webp" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
Adobe's subscription model is extortion with a UI, and downloading 30GB of updates every other week feels like getting repeatedly slapped in the face with your own wallet. That's why tools like Flixier, Synthesia,  and Canva are exploding. They're not trying to replace Premiere - they're trying to help people who just need to get shit done without selling a kidney.</p>
<p>\
I forced myself to use browser editors for a month and the feeling now? It works for quick social posts. Simple as that. Flixier works for basic/advanced edits and some of its pretty nice AI features. No crashes. No lag.</p>
<p>\
Synthesia is perfect for that perfect avatar of yours if you‚Äôre dreading filming yourself or for those corporate and onboarding videos.</p>
<p>\
Canva's templates make even my trash footage look semi-professional. For most people posting on social media, this is probably enough. 4K editing is where things get real. Most editors choke immediately, but Flixier surprised me. It handled my footage better than expected - still not perfect, but smooth enough to actually work with. My laptop stayed cool enough to keep on my lap without risking future children.</p>
<h2 id="thetruecostoffree">The True Cost of "Free"</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uth9XQYwb1eyk2Boeeg37EmS7G82-5z13391.gif.webp" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
Yeah, the free tiers are basic. But $10-15 a month for Flixier or Canva is a lot easier to swallow than Adobe's Creative Cloud ransom demands + and I'm really skeptical that I've completely uninstalled it from my laptop‚Ä¶There are countless <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/1d8v6jq/impossible_to_uninstall_adobe/">threads on Reddit</a> complaining about this bit. With online tools, you simply get what you pay for, and that's exactly what you need.</p>
<p>\
The Harsh Truth</p>
<p>\
The cloud is just a computer in some warehouse in Texas. But maybe that's not so bad. Your projects are backed up automatically. You can edit from anywhere. Sure, every upload burns some energy, but so does running a 1000W gaming PC for editing.</p>
<p>\
Collaboration actually works most of the time. I edited a project with someone in Berlin without wanting to throw my laptop out the window. That's progress.</p>
<h2 id="phoneeditingissomehowbetternow">Phone Editing Is Somehow Better Now</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uth9XQYwb1eyk2Boeeg37EmS7G82-85333rq.gif.webp" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
I tried editing on my phone. It didn't suck completely. These apps are getting better fast, especially Canva's mobile version. I cut together a decent video on the L train without having a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>\
Some kid at my coffee shop showed me his phone-edited videos. They were good. Really good. Made me realize something - maybe we're the last generation that needs professional editing software. These kids are doing more with a phone app than I could do with Final Cut Pro a few years ago.</p>
<h2 id="afewfinalwords">A Few Final Words</h2>
<p>For most people, browser-based editors are probably the future. They're not perfect. They'll crash sometimes. You'll lose work occasionally. But they're democratizing video creation in a way that matters. Not everyone needs to be Spielberg - sometimes you just need to make a decent TikTok about your dog.</p>
<p>\
I'm keeping my desktop editor for serious projects. But I'm also keeping Flixier bookmarked for quick edits and Canva for when I need something to look good fast. If you need me, I'll be trying to explain to my accountant why I need both.</p>
<p>\
Just don't edit anything important on airport wifi. That's not advice ‚Äì it's a fact.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Biden admin snubs Tesla‚Äôs $100 million big-rig charging funding request ‚Äî again</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/biden-admin-snubs-teslas-100-million-big-rig-charging-funding-request-again/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:32:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Transportation announced Friday another $636 million in funding that will be awarded to 49 applicants¬†for electric-vehicle charging infrastructure &#8212; and Tesla&#8217;s application for nearly $100 million to fund a big-rig charging corridor was once again passed over.

<h2 id="32evaluationondownstreamtasks">3.2. Evaluation on downstream tasks</h2>
<p>In order to compare to other models in the literature, we train all our models for 300B tokens before evaluating on downstream tasks. The two external baselines that we compare to are Mamba-3B (Gu and Dao, 2023), the strongest small recurrent model reported in the literature to date, and Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), a widely used open Transformer model. Both external baselines have been trained on significantly more than 300B tokens ‚Äì Mamba has been trained on 600B tokens, twice more, and Llama-2 has been trained on 2T tokens, nearly seven times more. We note however that both Mamba and Llama-2 were trained on different datasets and with different hyper-parameter tuning strategies, which may partially explain our strong performance. We therefore also include our own MQA transformer baseline, trained on the same data and with the same hyper-parameter tuning budget as Hawk and Griffin.</p>
<p>\
We provide an evaluation on downstream tasks in Table 1. We find that both Hawk and Griffin achieve very strong performance. In line with other works, we report character normalized accuracy on MMLU, HellaSwag, PIQA, ARC-E and ARC-C, while we report absolute accuracy on WinoGrande with partial scoring. The performance of Hawk improves significantly as we increase the model size, and Hawk-3B achieves stronger performance on downstream tasks than Mamba-3B, despite being trained on half as many tokens. Griffin-3B significantly outperforms Mamba-3B, and Griffin-7B and Griffin-14B achieve performance competitive with Llama-2, despite being trained on nearly 7 times fewer tokens. Hawk is also competitive with our MQA Transformer baseline, while Griffin outperforms this baseline.</p>

In this compelling 'Behind the Startup' series, we dive deep into the minds of two leaders who are reshaping how blockchain technology integrates with everyday life. From addressing the challenges of gig workers in Indonesia to creating innovative Mini Dapps within messaging platforms, Kaia's approach offers a unique glimpse into the future of digital transformation in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: Hi Eddie Kim and Ashwani, welcome to our 'Behind the Startup' series. Please share about your journey and what drew you to blockchain technology. We would love to hear about your experience in Kaia?</p>
<p>\
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Before entering the Web3 industry, I worked in the international development sector with various organizations, including UNICEF, WHO, the UN Secretariat, and ASEAN. My role was to support the sustainable development of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. One of the biggest challenges in this sector is the slow pace of change‚Äîit often takes years to see the tangible results of your efforts. The only notable exception is projects involving the introduction of new technology. When a country or community adopts innovative technology, the impact on people's lives can be immediate and transformative. This realization fueled my interest in focusing on technology and innovation.</p>
<p>\
During the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was in Indonesia, separated from my wife and son in Korea for over a year. That challenging and isolating experience led me to reevaluate my priorities. I decided to leave my position at ASEAN and return to Korea, even without a clear plan in place. After discussing my decision with my supervisor, I began exploring job opportunities in Korea, particularly in the ICT sector.</p>
<p>\
Around that time, a friend introduced me to the Web3 industry, sparking my interest in blockchain technology. The Kaia team (then the Klaytn team) was seeking someone to lead the decentralization process of the Kaia chain. My experience with international organizations and my academic background in governance made me an excellent fit for the role. This is how I transitioned into the Web3 industry.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Before I started my Web3 Journey, I worked mainly in the Banking industry as Head of data analytics and architecture for DBS, VISA, BNP Paribas, JPMC. My role was to understand the data needs from various departments and provide different solutions based on their needs. One of the biggest challenges for the Banking sector was a lot of regulations that made processes slow and expensive.</p>
<p>\
As I was part of the banking industry for almost a decade, I understand the banking shortfalls and importance of decentralization in this industry. For instance, just to transfer a thousand dollars from one country to another country, banks charge approx thirty to forty dollars as fees and take a couple of days to process the transactions. I learned about Bitcoin in 2013 but did not pay much attention but I got involved in the crypto industry in 2017. I got excited to understand about faster payments, low fees, and decentralization.</p>
<p>\
In 2021, I started exploring opportunities in the blockchain space to go deep into this sector. I came to know about Kaia (back then Klaytn) from a job portal in Singapore. I came to know about Kakao and how big companies are moving towards blockchain. This is how I moved from traditional finance to blockchain space.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: Kaia emerged from the chain merge with Klaytn. How does this evolution impact your goals for the platform's ecosystem and governance?</p>
<p>\
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Kaia emerged from the chain merger between Klaytn and Finschia. Klaytn was initiated by Kakao Group, renowned for its super app KakaoTalk, while Finschia was initiated by LINE Group, known for its own super app, LINE. Since both chains were developed by messenger companies, they shared a common goal: bringing Web2 users into Web3 through their messenger applications. This alignment of vision significantly facilitated a smooth technical and organizational merger.</p>
<p>\
From a governance perspective, we were fortunate as well. Both chains operated under a council-based governance model, with governance councils composed of global enterprises and ecosystem leaders successful in their respective chains. To consolidate, we simply merged the two councils into one unified governance structure. Again, we were fortunate that stakeholders from both chains aligned on the policies and strategic priorities of the new chain, which played a crucial role in making the merger a resounding success.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ashwani</strong>: As mentioned earlier, Kakao and Line groups are interested in exploring opportunities with newer technologies like blockchain with the same mission to bring more messenger users to blockchain to provide more transparency. With this merger, it will provide us more global experience and to understand and cater users in the SEA region. Klaytn was more prominent in Korea but with Line, it will expand to countries like Japan, Thailand and Taiwan.</p>
<p>\
Both companies worked on the council model for governance so merger was easier to align the common goals and directions. Council members are global enterprise and big web 3 companies. With this merger, Kaia ecosystem expanded to a bigger and stronger ecosystem.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: What differentiates Kaia's approach to blockchain ecosystem development from other platforms, particularly in emerging markets like Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>\
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Before discussing our approach to the Southeast Asian market as Head of Southeast Asia, I'd like to highlight our Kaia Wave program. Following the chain merger, we engaged in extensive discussions on how to maximize the value and momentum created by the merger. The conclusion was to leverage one of our strongest assets: LINE Messenger. Specifically, we decided to enable developers to build Mini Dapps directly on the LINE messaging app platform.</p>
<p>\
This decision was influenced by the success of TON and Telegram, but we believe we can achieve even more. Unlike Telegram, which is primarily used by Web3-native users, LINE is an integral part of everyday life for Web2 users‚Äîour families and friends rely on it for daily communication. Through this initiative, we aim to bring Web3 closer to everyday life, making it an accessible and meaningful part of people's routines.</p>
<p>\
This belief drove the launch of the Kaia Wave program, a builder support initiative designed to ensure that high-quality Mini Dapps are developed on the Kaia chain and integrated into LINE Messenger. Since the program's launch in September, we've received over 700 applications, and we are in the process of selecting the best products to feature on the first day of our Mini Dapp ecosystem launch via the Dapp Portal within the LINE messenger.</p>
<p>\
In terms of market entry strategy, we take a localization-first approach, as we recognize that each market has unique needs and desires. For example:</p>
<p>\
Vietnam, one of our priority markets, has a developer-centric ecosystem. After intensive market research and interviews with local partners, we learned that many developers aspire to replicate the success of Axie Infinity (though they no longer explicitly state this ambition). To support this vision, we established a local team in Vietnam to assist developers in building on the Kaia chain and achieving their goals.</p>
<p>\
The Philippines has a gamer-oriented market. Gamers there often dream of creating large gaming guilds like YGG. In response, we focus on collaborating with local game guilds, helping them expand their communities and integrate into our Web3 gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>\
This market-specific approach is how we build ecosystems tailored to local needs. Now, I am in India to better understand the dreams and aspirations of the Indian market and to explore how we can align our initiatives with its unique opportunities.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Kaia sets itself apart in blockchain development for Southeast Asia by focusing on accessibility, integration with popular platforms, and real-world applications. Its standout feature is embedding blockchain services into messaging apps like LINE and KakaoTalk, which have extensive user bases in the region. This integration lowers barriers to entry by enabling users to access wallets and decentralized applications (dApps) directly within familiar platforms, eliminating the need for specialized(technical) knowledge.</p>
<p>\
Kaia supports developers with tools like the NEXT WEB SDK and the Kaia Wave program, which offers funding and mentorship. These initiatives foster innovation, helping create tailored applications for Southeast Asian markets. Additionally, Kaia bridges traditional finance and blockchain through the tokenization of real-world assets such as gold, real estate, and ships, enhancing liquidity and expanding investment opportunities.</p>
<p>\
By leveraging strategic partnerships, Kaia ensures robust ecosystem support and scalability. Its user-centric approach aligns with the high mobile adoption and digital engagement in Southeast Asia, making blockchain more accessible to everyday users. With its blend of Web2 familiarity and Web3 innovation, Kaia positions itself as a leader in the region, driving adoption and creating practical, inclusive use cases for blockchain technology.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: With your background in sustainable development and analytics, how do you see blockchain, specifically Kaia, addressing pressing global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and climate change in Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>\
<strong>Eddie</strong>: Frankly speaking, Kaia is still a startup, and like most startups, our primary focus is on ensuring the success of the Kaia chain. While ESG considerations are not our immediate focus, they remain important and will naturally follow as we achieve a certain level of success.</p>
<p>That said, this does not mean Kaia is not contributing to addressing global challenges. In fact, we are already witnessing meaningful use cases where blockchain technology is making a positive impact on sustainable development issues. For example, one of our portfolio companies in Indonesia is leveraging blockchain technology to promote financial inclusion.</p>
<p>\
This company addresses the significant challenge faced by gig workers in accessing traditional financial services. In Indonesia, most banks do not provide loans to gig workers, even when they have regular incomes. To solve this, the company offers microfinance solutions to gig workers and records loan repayment transactions on the Kaia chain as NFTs. These NFTs serve as a verifiable record of financial behavior.</p>
<p>\
Through partnerships with local banks, they aim to ensure that these NFTs can be used as a reference for gig workers to access traditional loans. This innovative use of blockchain technology highlights how Kaia's ecosystem can contribute to addressing real-world challenges, even at this early stage of our journey.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Kaia leverages blockchain's transparency and decentralization to address poverty, inequality, and climate change in Southeast Asia. By enabling financial inclusion through decentralized finance (DeFi) and low-cost remittances, Kaia aims to unbanked populations. It ensures transparency and supports decentralized governance, giving communities control over resources. Through tokenized assets (e.q, tokenization of ships in Indonesia), it unlocks investment opportunities, while its analytics measure impact and optimize resource allocation.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: Southeast Asia is known for its rapidly growing tech-savvy population. What strategies are you employing to foster grassroots adoption of Kaia's blockchain technology in the region?</p>
<p>\
<strong>Eddie Kim</strong>: I believe I've already addressed this question earlier, but I'd like to add one more important point‚Äîour partnership strategy. We consistently strive to identify local partners with strong community and developer relationships and invite them to become governance council members.

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome L√º Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/1900-6418327/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Griffin Models: Outperforming Transformers with Scalable AI Innovation</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/griffin-models-outperforming-transformers-with-scalable-ai-innovation?source=rss</link><author>Gating</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:23:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>:::info

<h2 id="31scalingcurves">3.1. Scaling curves</h2>
<p>We present our main scaling results in Figure 1(a). All three model families are trained at a range of model scales from 100M to 7B parameters, with an additional Griffin model with 14 billion parameters. We increase the number of training tokens to be roughly proportional to the number of parameters of the model, as prescribed by the Chinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Models are trained on the MassiveText dataset (Hoffmann et al., 2022), previously used to train Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) and Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), although we use a slightly different data subset distribution. A sequence length of 2048 tokens was used (see Section 6 for results with longer sequences.) All experiments use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). We tune the learning rate, weight decay and ùõΩ2 parameters for small models, and use these runs to identify scaling rules for these hyper-parameters which predict their optimal values for the 7B and 14B models.</p>
<p>\
All three model families demonstrate a linear scaling relationship between the validation loss and training FLOPs (see Figure 1(a); note both axes are in log scale), as previously observed for Transformers by Brown et al. (2020). Notably, Griffin achieves lower validation loss than the Transformer baseline across all FLOPs budgets despite not using any global attention layers. Hawk on the other hand achieves slightly higher validation loss, but this gap appears to close as the training budget increases.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-2r83vti.png" alt="Table 1 | Character normalized accuracy. Hawk is competitive with our Transformer baseline, and exceeds the reported performance of Mamba despite being trained on half as many tokens. Griffin outperforms our Transformer baseline, and matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on roughly 7 times fewer tokens. We report unnormalized accuracy with partial scoring for WinoGrande." /></p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Ensure that you have the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Docusaurus Installed</strong>: You need a <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs">Docusaurus</a> project. If you don‚Äôt have one, we‚Äôll cover how to install it.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js Installed</strong>: Before building Docusaurus, ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from <a href="https://nodejs.org/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Knowledge of JavaScript</strong>: Familiarity with JavaScript is required to make the necessary changes to the configuration files.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Knowledge of API Documentation</strong>: Understanding how <a href="https://technicalwritingmp.com/docs/api-docs-course/introduction-to-api-documentation/">API documentation</a> works will help as you follow along.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Specification (OAS)</strong>: Create a ready-to-use OpenAPI specification file (either in JSON or YAML format) that describes your API's structure and endpoints.</li>
</ol>
<p>\
Now, let‚Äôs get started with integrating your API documentation into Docusaurus.</p>
<h2 id="step1setupdocusauruswithtypescript">Step 1: Set Up Docusaurus with TypeScript</h2>
<p>To begin, you‚Äôll need to set up a new Docusaurus project. Using TypeScript is highly recommended over JavaScript for enhanced type-checking, code reliability, and a smoother developer experience, especially when configuring and maintaining API documentation.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Create a New Docusaurus Project</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open your terminal</strong> and run the following command to initialize a Docusaurus project:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>   npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>npx create-docusaurus@latest</code>: Fetches and installs the latest version of Docusaurus.</li>
<li><code>my-website</code>: The name of your project directory. You can replace this with any name of your choice.</li>
<li><code>classic</code>: This preset sets up a basic Docusaurus site with default features, perfect as a starting point for customization.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Navigate into your project directory</strong> once the setup is complete:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>   cd my-website
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you have a fully initialized Docusaurus project. The following steps involve configuring it to support API documentation using the <code>OpenAPI plugin</code> and theme.</p>
<h2 id="step2convertyouropenapijsontoyaml"><strong>Step 2: Convert Your OpenAPI JSON to YAML</strong></h2>
<p>The OpenAPI plugin works best with YAML files due to their simplicity and readability. If your OpenAPI specification is currently in JSON format, you‚Äôll need to convert it to YAML.</p>
<p>\
This process is straightforward and can be accomplished using free online tools.</p>
<h2 id="whyuseyaml">Why Use YAML?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Readable Format:</strong> YAML‚Äôs structure is more human-readable than JSON's, especially for larger specifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ease of Management:</strong> Indentation-based formatting makes organizing and editing the file easier.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>A reliable tool such as <a href="https://www.site24x7.com/tools/json-to-yaml.html">Site24x7 JSON to YAML</a> Converter simplifies the conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="step3installtheopenapipluginandtheme"><strong>Step 3: Install the OpenAPI Plugin and Theme</strong></h2>
<p>With your Docusaurus project set up and the YAML file prepared, the next step is to install the OpenAPI plugin and theme. These tools will help generate and style your API documentation seamlessly.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Installation Commands:</strong></p>
<p>Run the following commands in your terminal to install the required packages:</p>
<pre><code> yarn add docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs
 yarn add docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs</code>: Automatically generates API documentation from your OpenAPI specification.</li>
<li><code>docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs</code>: Adds a user-friendly theme with pre-built components to display API documentation attractively.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Once installed, your project can be configured for API documentation integration.</p>
<h2 id="step4configuredocusaurusconfigts"><strong>Step 4: Configure</strong> <code>docusaurus.config.ts</code></h2>
<p>Now, update the Docusaurus configuration file (<code>docusaurus.config.ts</code>) to enable the OpenAPI plugin and theme. This file controls the behavior of your Docusaurus project.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Add Necessary Imports</strong></p>
<p>At the top of the configuration file, add these imports:</p>
<pre><code>    import type * as Plugin from "@docusaurus/types/src/plugin";
    import type * as OpenApiPlugin from "docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs";
</code></pre>
<p>\
<strong>Update the Presets Section</strong>.</p>
<p>Locate the <code>presets</code> section and include the following line in the <code>docs</code> Configuration:</p>
<pre><code>  docItemComponent: "@theme/ApiItem",
</code></pre>
<p>\
The updated <code>presets</code> Configuration should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>   presets: [
     [
       "classic",
       {
         docs: {
           sidebarPath: "./sidebars.ts",
           docItemComponent: "@theme/ApiItem", // Derived from docusaurus-theme-openapi
         },
         theme: {
           customCss: "./src/css/custom.css",
         },
       } satisfies Preset.Options,
     ],
   ],
</code></pre>
<p>\
<strong>Configure the Plugin and Theme:</strong></p>
<p>Add the following configuration for the OpenAPI plugin and theme before the <code>export default config;</code> Line:</p>
<pre><code>    plugins: [
      [
        'docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs',
        {
          id: "api", // Unique ID for the plugin
          docsPluginId: "classic", // Refers to the preset-classic Docusaurus setup
          config: {
            petstore: {
              specPath: "openapitest.yaml", // Path to your OpenAPI YAML file
              outputDir: "docs/rpcapi", // Where the generated API docs will be stored
              sidebarOptions: {
                groupPathsBy: "tag", // Group endpoints by tags in the sidebar
              },
            } satisfies OpenApiPlugin.Options,
          }
        },
      ]
    ],
    themes: ["docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs"], // Add the OpenAPI theme for visual styling
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Key Configuration Details</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>specPath</code>: Path to your OpenAPI YAML file. Update it with the actual location if it is different.</p></li>
<li><p><code>outputDir</code>: Directory where the API documentation will be generated. You can customize this.</p></li>
<li><p><code>groupPathsBy</code>: Groups endpoints by tags in the OpenAPI spec, improving navigation in the sidebar.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Save your changes to <code>docusaurus.config.ts</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="step5generateapidocumentation"><strong>Step 5: Generate API Documentation</strong></h2>
<p>With the configuration complete, you‚Äôre ready to generate the API documentation.</p>
<p>\
In this tutorial, the <code>docs.rpcapi</code> folder (or the folder you specified in <code>outputDir</code>).</p>
<p>\
<strong>Command to Generate Documentation:</strong></p>
<p>Run the following command in the root of your Docusaurus project:</p>
<pre><code>yarn docusaurus gen-api-docs all
</code></pre>
<p>This command processes your OpenAPI YAML file and generates API documentation in the specified output directory.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Expected Output:</strong></p>
<p>You should see a response similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>    Successfully created "docs/rpcapi"
    Successfully created "docs/rpcapi/sidebar.ts"
    Successfully created "docs/rpcapi/rsk-rpc-methods-v-0-9-0-with-apikey.info.mdx"
    Successfully created "docs/rpcapi/eth-accounts.api.mdx"
    ‚ú®  Done in 3.02s.
</code></pre>
<p>Your API documentation is now generated and ready to be served on your Docusaurus site.</p>
<h2 id="step6viewthedocumentation">Step 6: View the Documentation</h2>
<p>After generating your API documentation, you can preview it by running the Docusaurus development server.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Start the Development Server.</strong></p>
<p>\
In your terminal, navigate to the root of your Docusaurus project and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>yarn start
</code></pre>
<p>\
This command starts the Docusaurus development server and makes your site available locally.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Access the Documentation</strong>:</p>
<p>Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:</p>
<pre><code> http://localhost:3000
</code></pre>
<p>Your newly generated API documentation is neatly organized and rendered based on your OpenAPI specification.</p>
<p>\
<strong>What to Expect:</strong></p>
<p>Your API documentation will include:</p>

In the expanding world of blockchain, where every digital asset is a potential entry point, the <a href="https://gopluslabs.io/">GoPlus Foundation</a> aims to deliver that lock. The <a href="https://gopluslabs.io/">GoPlus</a> today announced its native utility token, $GPS, designed to unify and secure the GoPlus Security Network. This development marks GoPlus‚Äôs evolution from a centralized service to a decentralized security infrastructure protecting transactions across diverse blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>\
The $GPS token underpins what <a href="https://gopluslabs.io/">GoPlus</a> calls its ‚ÄúSecure Universe,‚Äù a network architecture focused on transaction safety. Through this new structure, the Foundation seeks to encourage active community participation, allowing anyone to contribute security data and bolster the system‚Äôs defenses. The Foundation envisions a future where security becomes a common resource, accessible to users and developers on any chain.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Bybit_Official/status/1878743820231213285?embedable=true">https://x.com/Bybit_Official/status/1878743820231213285?embedable=true</a></p>
<p>\
The move represents GoPlus‚Äôs transformation from a centralized service provider to a decentralized security network‚Äîa development that recalls the way expanding cities once required new defensive measures to safeguard their growing populations. In that same spirit, GoPlus aims to secure every transaction in an ever-accelerating Web3 universe.</p>
<p>\
Since its inception in 2020, GoPlus has processed more than 30 million security detection requests daily across 30 or more blockchains, protecting tens of billions of dollars in digital assets. Its services are trusted by leading wallets, decentralized exchanges, and diverse projects, with over 10,000 developers and protocols relying on GoPlus solutions. Observers note this trust as a foundation on which GoPlus can now build a fully decentralized model, enabling broader participation in securing the network.</p>
<p>\
The newly introduced (GPS) token underpins GoPlus‚Äôs ambition to create a ‚ÄúSecure Universe,‚Äù where every transaction is continuously protected. Individuals can use (GPS) for security service fees, while enterprises can access advanced security APIs by paying in the token. In addition, projects can tap into the SafeToken Protocol for secure liquidity management, also settled in (GPS). The token encourages active participation in maintaining the network, allowing contributors to stake (GPS) to operate security service nodes or provide security data; in return, they earn rewards for supporting the infrastructure. Early participants will have access to additional incentives through staking and contribution programs that further align the interests of users and developers.</p>
<p>\
The total supply of (GPS) is capped at 10 billion tokens. GoPlus Foundation has segmented the distribution as follows: 24.67 percent goes to Community and Development; 10 percent to Ecosystem Growth; 6 percent to Marketing and Growth; 10 percent to Airdrops; 7 percent to Liquidity; 3 percent to Advisors; and 39.33 percent allocated to initial contributors and private investors. Officials at GoPlus regard this breakdown as essential to balancing the needs of the community at large with those of early backers, aiming for long-term value rather than short-term speculation.</p>
<p>\
Building upon the widespread use of its existing services, GoPlus now seeks to deepen its decentralized architecture. By embedding (GPS) as the cornerstone of its security network, the Foundation aspires to align incentives across developers, node operators, and end-users. The organization believes this collaborative model will help tackle the ever-increasing challenges of safeguarding digital assets amid the rapid evolution of blockchain applications.</p>
<p>\
Detailed information on the Token Generation Event (TGE), including timelines, participation mechanics, and extended product features, will be released in the near future. Industry participants emphasize that this development may mark a pivotal juncture in the realm of blockchain security, underscoring the growing demand for robust, user-focused defenses. GoPlus Foundation remains committed to providing a secure, inclusive ecosystem, a mission that gains momentum through the introduction of (GPS).</p>
<p>\
GoPlus Foundation is a recognized leader in Web3 security. Its offerings cover all stages of on-chain transactions, aiming to protect users every step of the way. Services tailored for wallets, decentralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, and public blockchains represent the organization‚Äôs broader strategy: to establish a global safeguard network that any project or user can access.</p>

Recently, I‚Äôve run into a case where after cloning a dictionary ContainsKey no longer worked for items cloned.</p>
<p>\
This inspired me to create a new library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/lofcz/FastCloner">FastCloner</a>&nbsp;for the modern .NET Core that would&nbsp;<em>just work</em>. Out of the box. Cyclic references, delegates, read-only collections‚Ä¶ as many edge cases covered as possible.</p>
<p>\
There are still some scenarios, such as unmanaged memory, where cloning can go awry, but it should be a major improvement over the prior art. Feel free to check it out!</p>
<p>\
Using FastCloner is straightforward:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the library:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="powershell language-powershell">dotnet add package FastCloner
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Clone your objects:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="csharp language-csharp">using FastCloner.Code;
var clone = FastCloner.DeepClone(new { Hello = "world", MyList = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1 } });
</code></pre>
<p>\n Excluding fields &amp; properties from cloning is simple as well:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp language-csharp">private class TestPropsWithIgnored
{
    [FastClonerIgnore] // &lt;-- decorate such members with [FastClonerIgnore]
    public string B { get; set; } = "My string";

    public int A { get; set; } = 10;
}

TestPropsWithIgnored original = new TestPropsWithIgnored { A = 42, B = "Test value" };
TestPropsWithIgnored clone = original.DeepClone(); // clone.B is null (default value of a given type)
</code></pre>
<p>\n As a bonus, FastCloner also supports shallow cloning:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// the list is shared between the two instances
var clone = FastCloner.ShallowClone(new { Hello = "world", MyList = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1 } });
</code></pre>

The analysis found that 18-22% of advertised positions across technology, finance, and healthcare sectors went unfilled, while nearly 70% of companies posted at least one ghost job in the second quarter of 2024. 

Construction, arts, food and beverage, and legal industries showed the highest rates of ghost listings. In response, Greenhouse and LinkedIn have introduced verification systems for job postings. LinkedIn reports more than half its listings are now tagged as "verified," indicating confirmed open positions. Companies maintain ghost listings for various reasons, including projecting growth, keeping options open for exceptional candidates, or meeting federal posting requirements, said Jon Stross, Greenhouse's president and co-founder.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<h2 id="3recurrentmodelsscaleasefficientlyastransformers">3. Recurrent Models Scale as Efficiently as Transformers</h2>
<p>Scaling studies provide important insights into how to tune the hyperparameters of a model and its behaviour at scale. Here, we define the models evaluated in our studies, and provide scaling curves up to and beyond 7B parameters. Finally, we assess the performance of our models on downstream tasks. We consider 3 model families in this work; (1) a MQA-Transformer baseline, (2) Hawk; our pure RNN model, and (3) Griffin; our hybrid model which mixes recurrent blocks with local attention. We define the key model hyper-parameters for models across a range of scales in Appendix C.</p>
<p>\
<strong>MQA Transformer baseline</strong> Our Transformer baseline uses the residual pattern and the gated MLP block described in Section 2, in combination with MQA (Shazeer, 2019) and RoPE (Su et al., 2021).</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-k883vd3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
<strong>Griffin</strong> The key advantage of recurrent blocks over global attention is that they use a fixed state size to summarize the sequence, whereas the size of MQA‚Äôs KV cache grows proportional to sequence length. Since local attention (Section2.3) has the same property, mixing recurrent blocks with local attention preserves this benefit. We have found this combination extremely effective, since local attention accurately models the recent past, while the recurrent layers can transmit information across long sequences.</p>
<p>\
Griffin uses the same residual pattern and MLP block as our Transformer baseline. However unlike both our MQA Transformer baseline and the Hawk model, Griffin uses a mixture of recurrent blocks and MQA blocks. Specifically, we employ a layered structure by alternating two residual blocks with a recurrent block followed by one residual block which uses the local (MQA) attention block described in Section 2.3. Unless otherwise stated, the local attention window size is fixed to 1024 tokens.</p>

<hr />
<p>[2] Note that we match parameters with MHA attention block, though our Transformer baseline and Griffin ended up relying on MQA attention in order to improve inference efficiency. This means that our recurrent blocks have slightly more parameters than the corresponding MQA blocks.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: Predicting Crypto 2025: Up, Up, and‚Ä¶ Away?

<h2 id="2modelarchitecture">2. Model Architecture</h2>
<p>All our models contain the following components: (i) a residual block, (ii) an MLP block, and (iii) a temporal-mixing block. While (i) and (ii) are the same across all models, we consider three temporal mixing blocks: global Multi-Query Attention (MQA), local (sliding-window) MQA and our proposed recurrent block. As part of the recurrent block we use the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU) ‚Äì a novel recurrent layer inspired by the Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023b).</p>
<p>\
The residual block, as shown in Figure 2(a), defines the global structure of our models and is inspired by pre-norm Transformers (Xiong et al., 2020). After embedding the input sequence we pass it through ùëÅ such blocks (ùëÅ denoting the model depth), and then we apply RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) to produce the final activations. To compute the token probabilities we apply a final linear layer followed by a softmax. The weights of this layer are shared with the input embedding layer.</p>
<h3 id="21residualblock">2.1. Residual block</h3>
<p>The residual block contains two components, applied in order. The first component takes the hidden state ùë• and applies an RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), followed by the temporal-mixing block.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-p183vyg.png" alt="Figure 2 | a) The main backbone of our mode architecture is the residual block, which is stacked ùëÅ times. b) The gated MLP block that we use. c) The recurrent block that we propose as an alternative to Multi Query Attention (MQA). It uses our proposed RG-LRU layer, defined in Section 2.4." /></p>
<p>\
We then merge the output with a skip connection from ùë• through addition. Similarly, the second component applies RMSNorm, followed by the MLP block and then merges its output with a skip connection from the input of the RMSNorm. This block is illustrated in Figure 2 (a).</p>
<h3 id="22mlpblock">2.2. MLP block</h3>
<p>We use a gated MLP block (Dauphin et al., 2017) (illustrated in Figure 2(b)), which creates two branches from its input of dimension ùê∑. We apply a linear layer with output dimension ùëÄùê∑ on each branch, where ùëÄ denotes the expansion factor. For simplicity, we use ùëÄ =3 throughout this work. We apply a GeLU non-linearity (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) on one of the branches before merging them by element-wise multiplication, similar to GeGeLU (Shazeer, 2020). However, in our MLP block, we apply a final linear layer with output dimension ùê∑ on the outputs of the GeGeLU layer.</p>
<h3 id="23temporalmixingblocks">2.3. Temporal-mixing blocks</h3>
<p>The temporal-mixing block is the component of our model that aggregates hidden layer activations at different temporal locations in the sequence. We consider three temporal-mixing blocks: global MQA (Shazeer, 2019), local MQA (Beltagy et al., 2020) and our proposed Recurrent block.</p>
<p>\

<p>\
<strong>Local sliding window attention</strong> One of the key disadvantages of using global attention is that its computational complexity grows quadratically in the sequence length. To address this, several works have started to adopt local attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), also known as sliding window attention. It allows each position to attend only to a fixed number of tokens in the past. This not only reduces the computational FLOPs but also bounds the size of the KV cache to the size of window, making it no longer quadratic in the sequence length. All other details are the same as the global MQA.</p>

<h3 id="24realgatedlinearrecurrentunitrglru">2.4. Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU)</h3>
<p>Our proposed RG-LRU layer has a simple recurrence inspired by the Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023b), but incorporates a gating mechanism motivated by the literature on non-linear RNNs, in particular LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRUs (Chung et al., 2014). The equations describing the layer are as follows:</p>

<strong>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have fast inference and scale efficiently on long sequences, but they are difficult to train and hard to scale. We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) played a central role in the early days of deep learning and NLP research (Elman, 1990; Siegelmann and Sontag, 1991; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Mikolov et al., 2010; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), and achieved practical success in many applications, including Google‚Äôs first end to end machine translation system (Wu et al., 2016). However in recent years, both deep learning and NLP have been dominated by the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which interleaves multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and multi-head attention (MHA). Transformers achieve better performance than RNNs in practice and are also very efficient at utilizing modern hardware (Kaplan et al., 2020). Transformer-based large language models trained on massive datasets collected from the web have achieved remarkable success (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Gemini Team Google, 2023).</p>
<p>\
Despite their successes, Transformers are difficult to scale efficiently to long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of global attention. Additionally, the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with the sequence length makes Transformers slow during inference. Although Multi-Query Attention (MQA) (Shazeer, 2019) partially mitigates this issue by reducing the cache size by a constant factor, the cache still grows linearly in sequence length. Recurrent language models present a compelling alternative as they compress the entire sequence into a fixed-sized hidden state which is updated iteratively. However to replace Transformers, new RNN models must demonstrate not only comparable performance at scale but also achieve similar hardware efficiency (Gu et al., 2021a; Mehta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022; Orvieto et al., 2023b; Dao et al., 2022b; Poli et al., 2023; Gu and Dao, 2023).</p>
<p>\
In this work, we propose the RG-LRU layer, a novel gated linear recurrent layer, around which we design a new recurrent block to replace MQA. We build two new models using this recurrent block: Hawk, a model which interleaves MLPs with recurrent blocks, and Griffin, a hybrid model which interleaves MLPs with a mixture of recurrent blocks and local attention (Beltagy et al., 2020). We show that:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Hawk and Griffin exhibit power law scaling between held-out loss and training FLOPs, up to and beyond 7B parameters (Figure 1(a)), as previously observed for Transformers (Kaplan et al., 2020).</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Griffin achieves slightly lower held-out loss than strong Transformer baselines at all model scales.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\

The largest Griffin model shown has 14B parameters. b) Hawk and Griffin achieve significantly higher throughput than our MQA Transformer, especially when the length of the sample increases." /></p>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>We overtrain Hawk and Griffin on 300B tokens at a range of model scales. Hawk-3B exceeds the reported performance of Mamba-3B (Gu and Dao, 2023) on downstream tasks, despite being trained on half as many tokens. Griffin-7B and Griffin-14B match the performance of Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) despite being trained on roughly 7 times fewer tokens (Section 3.2).</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Both Hawk and Griffin achieve comparable training efficiency to Transformers on TPU-v3. Since diagonal RNN layers are memory bound, we achieve this with a kernel for the RG-LRU layer, implemented in Pallas (Bradbury et al., 2018), that minimizes memory transfers (Section 4).</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>During inference, both Hawk and Griffin achieve significantly higher throughput than MQA Transformers (Figure 1(b)), and they achieve lower latency when sampling long sequences (Section 5).</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p>Griffin performs better than Transformers when evaluated on sequences longer than those seen during training, and can also efficiently learn copying and retrieval tasks from training data (Section 6). However, Hawk and Griffin perform less well than Transformers when we evaluate pre-trained models on copying and exact-retrieval tasks without fine-tuning.</p></li>

<p>\
Many of my workflows began with prompts like ‚ÄúGive me ideas‚Äù or ‚ÄúShow me the steps on how I can,‚Äù and often ended with ‚ÄúFind improvements‚Äù or ‚ÄúRevise this text for a final draft.‚Äù Tasks that once demanded hours of deliberation and decision-making now flowed seamlessly, allowing me to reclaim precious time with more work.</p>
<p>\
I became the ultimate master of ‚Äògetting things done‚Äô delivering over 5 growth campaigns within the first 9 months of my first full-time job in the blockchain industry, and authoring 7 articles about quantum computing technology when I had no prior knowledge on it.</p>
<p>\
For two years, not a single task crossed the finish line without an A.I.‚Äôs input. Now, as I build my blockchain marketing portfolio, I‚Äôm struck by how effective my AI-assisted work has been‚Äîconsistently achieving results that were 'good enough.' However, I also notice what‚Äôs missing: the bold uniqueness and true innovation that make work unforgettable.</p>
<p>\
Generative A.I., after all, is trained on existing data and generates responses by predicting and reproducing patterns in the most contextually familiar way.</p>
<p>\
ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity are not at fault for the lack of boldness and uniqueness in my portfolio. Their familiarity-preferring algorithms, and predictive methods imitating online text are in fact strikingly similar to how our brains work to reach solutions of creativity.</p>
<p>\
In fact, Aristotle once said that art and creativity often stem from mimicking nature or other works. Confucian philosophies also valued learning and imitation, but only as a means of mastering knowledge before creating something new.</p>
<p>\
Observing myself in retrospect, I concluded that the lack of uniqueness in my marketing portfolio was solely my accountability. I had over-relied on AI, hooked on the rush of it giving me fast answers that boosted my productivity, churning out deliverables like clockwork. I was vaping my way through prompts and answers, giving myself artificial injections of dopamine and serotonin that could have otherwise naturally come from thinking deeply about something for a long-time and finally reaching a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the past two years, ChatGPT has undergone 23 updates, each significantly improving its accuracy, reasoning, and problem-solving capabilities since its public release. As for my own updates? Productivity, definitely‚Äîbut reasoning, problem-solving, and accuracy? Maybe, though none as transformative as ChatGPT's evolution.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zozISNvPY6Xa14qQbao4YxXdCAd2-sy03995.png" alt="A summary of OpenAI's ChatGPT updates since Nov, 2022" /></p>
<p>\
AI is designed to replicate the solutions we might reach with more time, making it easy to delegate tasks like reasoning, problem-solving, and ensuring accuracy. At first glance, this might not seem harmful. But the truth is, ==the process matters more than the outcome.== Destinations reached through AI shortcuts are inherently different from those achieved without it, even if they seem identical on the surface.</p>
<hr />
<p>After going through extensive research about mankind‚Äôs greatest achievements, I‚Äôve concluded that the grueling thinking processes we delegate to AI in exchange for speed and efficiency is the key to cultivate a trait that AI, no matter how advanced, can never possess.</p>
<p>\
According to philosophers such as Socrates, and Emmanuel Kant along with the Christian body, The Enlightenment Movement, and the pioneers of the Romanticism - there exists something in humans that transcends intelligence ‚Äîa quality that designates certain individuals as exceptional and defines our ability to create and innovate. This essence, the very force that enabled us to bring AI into existence, must be nurtured to maintain our distinctiveness as a species.</p>
<p>\
Socrates was among the first to articulate this concept, referring to it in Latin as ‚Äúdaimonion.‚Äù He described his daimonion as a guiding spirit, particularly in moral decisions. It was not a source of knowledge or intellect, but rather a moral compass that steered him away from improper behavior. Paradoxically, it was Socrates‚Äô humility and acknowledgment of his own ignorance‚Äîhis famous belief that he knew nothing‚Äîthat set him apart and elevated his wisdom above that of his peers.</p>
<p>\
==The term "daimonion" would later be translated into English as ‚Äú<strong>genius</strong>.‚Äù==</p>
<p>\
‚ÄòGenius‚Äô is a word that most of us cannot relate to, as it has become a term heavily used by the PR/Marketing specialists of the most successful people of the world. Today, it often serves as a convenient excuse for bad behavior, overshadowing its deeper significance. Modern cognitive science has further diluted the concept by framing human cognition in measurable terms‚Äîprocessing speed, memory, and problem-solving ability‚Äîreducing genius to mere variations of quantifiable traits.</p>
<p>\
However, the concept of genius predates modern intelligence theories, and was initially linked to spiritual or otherworldly guidance rather than intellect. It was never synonymous to intelligence, as Socrates‚Äô acknowledgement of his own ignorance (something A.I. is incapable of by the way) was celebrated as a form of genius - his humility, insight, and the ability to question deeply.</p>
<p>\
In the Christian era, genius intertwined with spirituality, as mystic-saints sought unity with God. These figures believed in profound truths beyond intellectual comprehension, accessible through divine encounters or moments of ecstasy.</p>
<p>\
It wasn‚Äôt until The Enlightenment Movement in the 18th century that the term Genius became closer to the way we understand it today, shifting its focus from divine visitation to individual creativity. Immanuel Kant emphasized that true genius created transformative art by inspiration, not imitation or adherence to rules. For Kant, genius was not about technical skill but about originality‚Äîthe ability to forge new paths and redefine the boundaries of human achievement.</p>
<p>\
The Romantic movement further elevated the concept of genius, celebrating it as a profound expression of human truths through intuition and inspiration. For them, genius was not just a personal attribute but a force that connected humanity to deeper, universal truths.</p>
<p>\
Further in the 20th century, figures like Albert Einstein, Kurt G√∂del, John von Neumann, and J. Robert Oppenheimer were celebrated as scientific geniuses, not solely for their extraordinary intellectual achievements but for their ability to think intuitively and creatively in ways that reshaped our understanding of the world. Their work often seemed to stem from an almost mystical insight, a quality that aligned them with the Romantic notion of genius as an unquantifiable force capable of reaching beyond the constraints of formal logic.</p>
<hr />
<p>As is typical of modern science, which seeks to classify and quantify everything, most of us were excluded from the classification as a ‚Äògenius‚Äô and were left self-labeled ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù at the most. And in quantifiable intelligence measures such as speed, and variety of solutions ‚Äî A.I. has consistently outperformed us.</p>
<p>\
And over the past 20 years, films like <em>A Space Odyssey</em>, <em>iRobot</em>, and <em>The Terminator</em> have offered captivating predictions of a future where A.I. breaks their programmings and potentially overpowers humanity. This narrative fueled an instinctive yet false impression long before tools like ChatGPT were even introduced to the public. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_forecasting">cultural prefiguration</a> of A.I. has not only blinded us to the possibility that humans might surpass A.I. in certain ways but has also prematurely defined A.I. as inherently superior to us.</p>
<p>\
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who has naturally found themselves taking the passenger‚Äôs seat at work while A.I. takes the wheel, thinking, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better this way.‚Äù</p>
<p>\
We‚Äôve rarely considered the genius we might bring to the table because we‚Äôve never seen ourselves as geniuses. And maybe, scientifically speaking, we aren‚Äôt. But if genius were viewed as a spectrum rather than a binary (as many things are increasingly proven to be), humans would likely sit further along that spectrum than A.I.</p>
<p>\
<strong>After all, no matter how advanced algorithms become in reasoning, problem-solving, or accuracy, they remain bound by predefined parameters, and rules while operating only within familiar frameworks incapable of calculating morals, intuition, inspiration and expression.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Moments that make genius seemingly possible from A.I. can be seen from media reports about A.I. hallucinations - when A.I. makes up information that appears factual. For example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/science/ai-hallucinations-science.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare">this article</a> tells a story on how A.I. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/technology/chatbots-hallucination-rates.html">hallucinations</a> have been beneficial to scientists for generating highly implausible yet novel (genius) ideas to tackle challenges, like designing entirely new molecules.</p>
<p>\
However, A.I. hallucinations are nothing more than an error that can‚Äôt be controlled nor can be intentional. It is a joyous serendipity at the most, and cannot be described as genius.</p>
<p>\
And shouldn‚Äôt A.G.I. (the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can) be considered genius?</p>
<p>\
Not really. A.I. was first introduced as an academic discipline in the 1950s at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence where participants aimed at creating machines capable of replicating human cognitive functions such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. A.G.I is just one of the pre-defined fundamentals of A.I. that‚Äôs being further developed.</p>
<p>\
Maybe humans love A.I. so much because of how highly intelligent it can be without the possibility of it becoming a genius. And it‚Äôs perfectly fine to love A.I., as it stands as the genius invention of humanity‚Äîan incredible achievement of our kind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even after reading all this, you might be reluctant to admit that you are more ‚Äògenius‚Äô than A.I., especially if you‚Äôre a strong advocate of science that told you you‚Äôre not. Or it may be because the term raises discomfort that comes from the connotation of big ideas challenging societal norms. Figures like medieval saints and Socrates were often seen as dangerous, as they rejected societal conventions and sometimes faced execution for their defiance. This just shows how powerful our genius can be.</p>
<p>\
But Genius is not a test score, nor a quantifiable trait. ==Genius is not a cognitive function but rather a unique convergence of creativity, intuition, and insight that transcends raw intellectual abilities==. While cognitive functions like memory, reasoning, and problem-solving are essential components of intelligence, genius operates on a higher plane‚Äîmarked by the ability to perceive connections, challenge conventions, and create transformative ideas. It is an expression of originality and vision that cannot be reduced to measurable mental processes, as it embodies qualities of inspiration, emotional resonance, and a capacity to innovate in ways that defy purely cognitive explanation.</p>
<p>\
Genius begins as a brief spark during our problem-solving and reasoning processes‚Äîan instinctive moment of questioning that whispers, ‚Äúbut,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if,‚Äù ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù or ‚Äúcould it be?‚Äù</p>
<p>\
==It‚Äôs this very genius‚Äîour capacity to explore and question intuitively beyond rationale‚Äîthat we‚Äôre giving up in exchange for A.I.-generated shortcuts.==</p>
<hr />
<p>I wrote this story to share how I underestimated myself and overestimated A.I., in the hopes that you won‚Äôt make the same mistake. Since there is no manual on how to use A.I. properly, nor does a guide exist on how to balance our intelligence with that of A.I.</p>
<p>\
As A.I. has become an accessible tool for anyone over the age of 13, challenging ourselves has become a challenge in itself, with so many tempting shortcuts at our fingertips.</p>
<p>\
But perhaps, as long as we understand what sets us apart from this technology, we can avoid the discouragement and laziness that lead to over-reliance on it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Now that you know about the human-exclusive genius capabilities within you‚Äîcapabilities that are fading in exchange for shortcuts‚Äîhow will you adjust them?</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TinyFeed v1.0.0 Release</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0gyaj/tinyfeed_v100_release/</link><author>/u/TheBigRoomXXL</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Self Hosted</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0gyaj/tinyfeed_v100_release/"> <img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/6jcz7g6NdX31vJbdYGB7pc4A6d0OjTvR6kohRlQSTH0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef744de57d39e893c9415e3dbe4d041e3de1e72c" alt="TinyFeed v1.0.0 Release" title="TinyFeed v1.0.0 Release" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One year ago, I published TinyFeed on this subreddit for the first time, and I‚Äôm happy to announce that it has slowly improved since then.

But when your target market is crowded with established players and new entrants, the challenge becomes exponentially tougher.</p>
<p>\
When I worked at a startup, I was once tasked with solving a key problem for our users‚Äîa problem they were already addressing using a competitor‚Äôs product. Specifically, users were relying on a tool that excelled in automating report generation but lacked flexibility for real-time collaboration. My team identified this gap and set out to design a solution that integrated collaborative features, such as live document editing and instant feedback loops, which the competitor‚Äôs product didn‚Äôt offer. Breaking into such a saturated space felt like pushing a boulder uphill, but we learned to focus on delivering undeniable value.</p>
<p>\
That experience, coupled with my career journey of launching nearly 30 products across several companies, taught me invaluable lessons about navigating hyper-competitive markets. In this article, I‚Äôll share the critical factors I‚Äôve learned to consider when launching a product in a crowded market. These insights are designed to help you not just survive but thrive.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1deeplyunderstandyourtargetmarket">1. <strong>Deeply Understand Your Target Market</strong></h3>
<p>In a competitive space, there is no room for guesswork. Start by conducting comprehensive research to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identify underserved segments</strong>: For instance, while working on a rideshare platform, we discovered that users in suburban areas felt underserved compared to urban centers. Focusing on improved coverage in these areas created a unique opportunity to differentiate ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze competitors‚Äô strengths and weaknesses</strong>: Use tools like SWOT analysis to pinpoint areas where you can excel. For example, one competitor might have superior performance but lack intuitive user interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate your assumptions with real users</strong>: Engage directly with your audience through interviews, surveys, and user testing to ensure you‚Äôre solving a real problem. When launching a scheduling app, we discovered through user testing that the default calendar integrations were unintuitive, leading us to redesign how events were added.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example : Slack‚Äôs rise to fame during Covid!</strong></p>
<p>\
When Slack entered the crowded communication tools market, they focused on delivering a seamless user experience for people by really understanding their problems and solving for them, thus distinguishing themselves from clunkier alternatives. For example, when Covid-19 hit, Slack helped maintain company culture by creating channels for informal chats and social interaction, reducing isolation and keeping morale high among remote employees. Because of extreme reliance on digital communication, email volumes surged, but Slack helped by centralizing communication, making it easier to track conversations and reduce inbox clutter. Slack did this better than most of it‚Äôs competitors.</p>

<p>\</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2defineandcommunicateauniquevaluepropositionuvp">2. <strong>Define and Communicate a Unique Value Proposition (UVP)</strong></h3>
<p>Your product‚Äôs UVP is your weapon in a saturated market. It should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear</strong>: Avoid jargon and communicate in a way that resonates with your audience. For example, "Save 10 hours a week with automated invoicing" is clearer than "Streamline your operational workflows."</li>
<li><strong>Distinct</strong>: What makes your product irreplaceable? Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as explaining how you solve a problem better.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: Ensure your messaging aligns across all channels‚Äîwebsite, ads, emails, and product UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use frameworks like the "<strong>Jobs-to-be-Done</strong>" theory to articulate what ‚Äú<strong>job</strong>‚Äù your product accomplishes better than anyone else.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Example: Spotify reigning in the Music Streaming Market!</strong></p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job-to-be-Done</strong>: Music listeners need an easy, convenient way to discover, listen to, and manage their music collections across multiple devices without the hassle of downloading or managing files.</li>
<li><strong>How Spotify does it better</strong>: In the hyper-competitive music streaming market, Spotify stands out by offering a seamless user experience with personalized playlists (like Discover Weekly) and a massive music library, all accessible across devices.</li>
<li><strong>Why Spotify keeps winning:</strong> It continuously solves for music discovery and taste stagnation in the most creative ways getting better with each year. With a mature personalized playlist curation model, an AI-powered DJ and Wrapped, Spotify has truly learnt to stand out amongst competitors (YT music, Apple music etc.) whilst still solving for the same user problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>\

<hr />
<h3 id="3prioritizespeedwithoutcompromisingquality">3. <strong>Prioritize Speed Without Compromising Quality</strong></h3>
<p>In hyper-competitive markets, time is of the essence. However, releasing a half-baked product can backfire. Strike a balance by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focusing on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong>: Build only the core features that deliver your UVP. For example, we launched a photo-editing app with just three standout filters that worked flawlessly, rather than overloading it with mediocre options.</li>
<li><strong>Adopting agile development practices</strong>: Iterate quickly based on feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Testing thoroughly before launch</strong>: Ensure your product works seamlessly for the most critical use cases. For instance, before launching a payment gateway, we stress-tested transaction processing under peak loads.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
<strong>Example: Shopify</strong> <strong>making a dent in e-commerce!</strong></p>
<p>Shopify experienced remarkable growth during the COVID-19 pandemic as more businesses moved to e-commerce. This was mainly due to fast yet strategic launch of offerings for businesses to sell online. In a span of a year, they grew revenue by <a href="https://growthnatives.com/blogs/ecommerce/tracking-shopifys-boom-in-ecommerce-business/">over 80% and onboarded nearly 800k new businesses</a>! This growth was fueled by features like "Shopify Payments," "Shopify Capital," and "Shopify Fulfillment Network" to make it easier for businesses to manage online stores, process payments, and fulfill orders.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-yo634be.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
A key lesson to be learnt here that churning out offerings extremely quickly often means the product teams are taking up an iterative approach by breaking the complex bundle of features into several simpler parts and shipping them one after the other, whilst keeping a tab on user adoption. It‚Äôs a great tactic, one I tend to rely on a lot!</p>
<p>\</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4investindifferentiatedbranding">4. <strong>Invest in Differentiated Branding</strong></h3>
<p>In crowded markets, your brand‚Äôs personality can make a lasting impression. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Visual identity</strong>: Is your design modern and appealing? For a fitness app, we chose vibrant, energetic colors and clean typography to appeal to younger audiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tone of voice</strong>: Are you approachable, authoritative, or innovative? Match your tone to your audience. For example, a financial planning tool might benefit from a reassuring and professional tone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Share the story behind your product to build an emotional connection with users. For example, our marketing campaign for a productivity tool highlighted how it was inspired by the challenges of remote work during the pandemic.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> <strong>Nike and it‚Äôs inspirational running stories!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differentiated Branding</strong>: Nike has built its brand around the theme of athletic empowerment and self-expression. The ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù slogan and endorsement of top athletes has made Nike synonymous with perseverance, excellence, and motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Key Differentiators</strong>: Inspirational messaging, innovative athletic wear, and exclusive collaborations with celebrities and designers.</li>
</ul>
<p>\

<hr />
<h3 id="5leveragedatafordecisionmaking">5. <strong>Leverage Data for Decision-Making</strong></h3>
<p>Hyper-competitive markets require you to make quick, informed decisions. Set up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data analytics tools</strong>: Track key metrics like acquisition, engagement, and retention. For instance, using tools like Mixpanel allowed us to understand feature usage patterns during beta testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback loops</strong>: Regularly gather qualitative and quantitative insights from users. One product we launched had an in-app feedback button that yielded actionable insights within the first week.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competitor benchmarking</strong>: Stay updated on what competitors are introducing and how users are reacting.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Build dashboards that give you real-time visibility into your product‚Äôs performance.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Example : Netflix and extreme AB testing</strong></p>
<p>\
Netflix thrives in a hyper-competitive market by using data analytics tools to track key metrics like acquisition, engagement, and retention. By analyzing user behavior, including content preferences and consumption patterns, Netflix fine-tunes its recommendations engine and content investments. Tools such as <a href="https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/chapter_1/">Mixpanel</a> enable detailed insights into feature usage during beta testing, optimizing decisions on what content to create or acquire.</p>
<p>\
Funfact : Netflix use your personal data as <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/discovering-creative-insights-in-promotional-artwork-295e4d788db5">insights to select cover art for the movie titles</a> you see on your TV. Their idea is, "judge a movie by it‚Äôs cover‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="6focusonretentionnotjustacquisition">6. <strong>Focus on Retention, Not Just Acquisition</strong></h3>
<p>Winning users is one thing; keeping them is another. To retain users:</p>
<ul>

In Vanuatu, a powerful earthquake struck the archipelago, causing widespread destruction and severing vital submarine fiber optic cable that had long been the lifeline for communication and connectivity. In Tonga, the country has experienced multiple internet outages related to its submarine cable infrastructure, with an 80% probability of such incidents recurring in the future.</p>
<p>\
In these critical moments, Starlink emerged as a beacon of hope, showcasing its remarkable capabilities in restoring connectivity and ultimately saving lives. Rather than relying solely on traditional infrastructure, which had been compromised, the people of Vanuatu and Tonga turned to Starlink's innovative satellite technology.</p>
<p>\
With a network of satellites orbiting the Earth, Starlink provided fast, reliable internet access that transcended the limitations of submarine cables. Imagine families separated by disaster, unable to communicate with loved ones or access essential services. With Starlink's deployment, individuals could connect to emergency services, share information, and reach out for help. In regions where every second counts, this connectivity was not just a convenience; it was a lifeline.</p>
<p>\
Starlink's technology facilitated critical communication, allowing first responders to coordinate rescue efforts effectively and ensuring that medical facilities could operate without interruption. In Tonga, where repeated outages had left communities disconnected, Starlink offered a more resilient alternative, ensuring that people could stay connected even during the most challenging times.</p>
<p>\
Reflecting on these recent events, my perspective on connectivity infrastructure is shifting. While Starlink has demonstrated the immediate practical benefits of satellite-based internet, emerging technology like <a href="https://spacecoin.org/">Spacecoin</a> is taking this concept even further by combining satellite connectivity with blockchain technology. This convergence of technologies suggests that not only do we not need traditional submarine cables, but we're on the cusp of a truly disruptive approach to internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>\
The traditional internet infrastructure, dominated by submarine cables and controlled by a handful of major telecommunications companies, has created a centralized system vulnerable to both natural disasters and human intervention. While Starlink's satellite network offers one path to decentralization, Spacecoin's vision of a blockchain-powered satellite network represents the next evolution in this journey. By combining Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites with blockchain technology, Spacecoin aims to create a trustless, decentralized network that could further democratize internet access and ensure complete freedom from centralized control.</p>
<p>\
This shift towards decentralization through both satellite technology and blockchain could dramatically impact global accessibility and free speech, particularly in regions like the Pacific Islands. Starlink has already shown how satellite-based systems can maintain connectivity during infrastructure failures. Spacecoin's blockchain integration could take this further by ensuring that this connectivity isn't just resilient but also resistant to censorship and control through its decentralized governance structure.</p>
<p>\
The crux of the connectivity challenge in the Pacific Islands lies not only in the "last mile" problem but also in the network effect that has kept communities tethered to traditional infrastructure solutions. While Starlink's Direct to Cell capability offers one solution, Spacecoin's blockchain-based approach could provide additional benefits by enabling peer-to-peer connectivity and removing the need for traditional telecommunications intermediaries entirely.</p>
<p>\
In light of these challenges, Starlink's Direct to Cell capability presents an innovative solution for enhancing connectivity in the Pacific. This technology allows individuals to connect their mobile devices directly to satellites, eliminating the need for traditional ground-based infrastructure entirely. In areas where terrestrial networks are sparse or unreliable, Direct to Cell provides a lifeline, enabling seamless communication even in the most remote locations. As this capability expands, it reinforces the notion that satellite solutions can effectively meet the unique needs of small island communities, offering a reliable alternative that avoids the pitfalls of underutilized submarine systems.</p>
<p>\
In the current internet landscape, algorithms controlled by major platforms significantly influence public perception and information flow. The combination of Starlink's satellite network and Spacecoin's blockchain technology could offer a powerful counter to this centralized control. While Starlink provides the physical infrastructure for decentralized access, Spacecoin's blockchain framework could ensure that the governance and operation of this infrastructure remain truly decentralized and community-driven.</p>
<p>\
While fully decentralized internet through satellite technology promises greater freedom from traditional forms of censorship, new challenges may emerge. The key will be ensuring that satellite providers themselves don't become new centralized authorities. This is where Spacecoin's blockchain governance model becomes particularly relevant, offering a transparent and democratic approach to network management that complements Starlink's physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>\
Starlink's satellites offer a more resilient and adaptable solution for small island nations. With the ability to roam and provide backhaul capabilities, Starlink can deliver high-speed internet to even the most remote locations, often at a fraction of the cost of traditional infrastructure. The earthquakes in Vanuatu and the recurring issues in Tonga have highlighted this shift, demonstrating that when disaster strikes, the ability to connect via satellite can be more effective than relying on undersea cables that can easily be severed.</p>
<p>\
As we embrace this new era of connectivity, we're seeing a convergence of solutions. Starlink has proven the viability of satellite-based internet in crisis situations, while Spacecoin's blockchain-powered approach promises to take this decentralization even further. For regions like Vanuatu and Tonga, this combination of technologies offers not just an alternative to traditional infrastructure, but a path toward a truly decentralized, resilient, and democratic internet.</p>
<p>\
The dawn of 2025 brings with it not just the promise of better connectivity, but of a fundamental transformation in how we think about internet infrastructure. As Starlink continues to demonstrate the practical benefits of satellite-based internet, and as Spacecoin develops its blockchain-powered satellite network, we're moving toward a future where the question isn't whether we can survive without submarine cables, but how quickly we can embrace these new decentralized technologies that promise to revolutionize global connectivity.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia Snaps Back at Biden&apos;s &apos;Innovation-Killing&apos; AI Chip Export Restrictions</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/1527220/nvidia-snaps-back-at-bidens-innovation-killing-ai-chip-export-restrictions?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:27:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nvidia has hit back at the outgoing Biden administration's AI chip tech export restrictions designed to tighten America's stranglehold on supply chains and maintain market dominance. From a report: The White House today unveiled what it calls the Final Rule on Artificial Intelligence Diffusion from the Biden-Harris government, placing limits on the number of AI-focused chips that can be exported to most countries, but allowing exemptions for key allies and partners. 

The intent is to work with AI companies and foreign governments to initiate critical security and trust standards as they build out their AI infrastructure, but the regulation also makes it clear that the focus of this policy is "to enhance US national security and economic strength," and "it is essential that ... the world's AI runs on American rails." Measures are intended to restrict the transfer to non-trusted countries of the weights for advanced "closed-weight" AI models, and set out security standards to protect the weights of such models. However GPU supremo Nvidia claims the proposed rules are so harmful that it has published a document strongly criticizing the decision.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

China's cyber program has stolen more American personal and corporate data than all other nations combined, Wray told CBS News. He said Chinese government hackers have infiltrated U.S. civilian infrastructure, including water treatment facilities, transportation systems and telecommunications networks, positioning themselves to potentially cause widespread disruption. 

"To lie in wait on those networks to be in a position to wreak havoc and can inflict real-world harm at a time and place of their choosing," Wray said. The FBI director, who is leaving his post nearly three years early after President-elect Donald Trump indicated he would make leadership changes, said China has likely accessed communications of some U.S. government personnel.

Board member Tom Conrad, a former Pandora chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO while the audio equipment maker searches for a permanent replacement, the company said. 

Spence's departure comes eight months after Sonos released a revamped app that launched with missing features and technical problems, leading to widespread customer complaints and necessitating an extensive fix-it effort. The company will pay Spence, who joined Sonos in 2012 as chief commercial officer, a $1.875 million severance package. He will remain as a strategic advisor until June 30, earning $7,500 monthly, according to a regulatory filing.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Anything left is tracked but not considered for future months.</p> </blockquote> <p>This approach has helped me stay in control of my money without the usual complexity found in financial tools that force you to budget every penny.</p> <p>For years, I relied on spreadsheets to do this, but as things got more complicated (multi-currency accounts, investments, custom rules, etc.), I wanted something more practical and powerful.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried them all, FireflyIII, Actual, Maybe, even paid options like Mobills and I couldn‚Äôt find anything that clicked with me ‚Äî so I built WYGIWYH.</p> <h3>Why WYGIWYH?</h3> <p>The app is based on a few core ideas:</p> <ul> <li>Simplicity ‚Äì Money management shouldn‚Äôt feel like extra work.</li> <li>No budgets ‚Äì This isn‚Äôt a guilt-tracking app. It‚Äôs about understanding where your money goes, not bound by strict budget categories.</li> <li>Living month-to-month ‚Äì Encourages using what you earn now, while protecting savings for future goals. It‚Äôs ideal for people who value clarity and flexibility over spreadsheets and overly structured finance apps.</li> </ul> <h3>Features</h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>Multi-currency support</strong>: Track multiple currencies for income, expenses, and savings without jumping through hoops. Great for those juggling multiple accounts or international transactions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Customizable transactions</strong>: Handle specific quirks like credit card billing cycles, installments, recurring transactions and transfer between accounts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Automation-ready API</strong>: Integrate it with your existing tools or automate expense tracking in the way that makes sense for your workflows.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Web-based and self-hosted</strong> (of course): Access it from anywhere through the browser, whether you‚Äôre on desktop or mobile, everything is fully responsive.</p></li> </ul> <h3>Who is WYGIWYH for?</h3> <p>It‚Äôs for anyone looking for a no-budget financial tracker with good multi-currency support. Ideal if:</p> <ul> <li>You don‚Äôt want a traditional budget but still want insight into where your money is going.</li> <li>You deal with multiple currencies and need a tool that can actually handle that properly.</li> <li>You‚Äôre frustrated with overly rigid personal finance tools like Mint, YNAB, or others.</li> </ul> <h3>Looking for feedback</h3> <p>Like many of you, I‚Äôm passionate about open and self-hosted solutions, so putting this out there to the community feels like the natural next step. If you decide to take WYGIWYH for a spin, I‚Äôd love your feedback ‚Äî bugs, feature requests, or even philosophical takes on finance tracking!</p> <h3>Get started</h3> <p>The code and setup instructions are on GitHub:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/eitchtee/WYGIWYH">WYGIWYH</a></p> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaips"> /u/Flaips </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0e886/introducing_wygiwyh_a_powerful_personal_finance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0e886/introducing_wygiwyh_a_powerful_personal_finance/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hmmmm</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1i0e64p/hmmmm/</link><author>/u/rdr2master123</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:40:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpt/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - ChatGPT</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1i0e64p/hmmmm/"> <img src="https://preview.redd.it/tcji9xynlrce1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358691eb95427155cb61a4df01d92b550196398a" alt="Hmmmm" title="Hmmmm" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rdr2master123"> /u/rdr2master123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/tcji9xynlrce1.jpeg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1i0e64p/hmmmm/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Microsoft-Contributed Change To Linux 6.13 Is Causing A Last Minute Ruckus</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.13-Dropping-EXECMEM_ROX</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A change to the Linux 6.13 kernel contributed by a Microsoft engineer ended up changing Linux x86_64 code without proper authorization and in turn causing troubles for users and now set to be disabled ahead of the Linux 6.13 stable release expected next Sunday...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can I just drill the case and mount hdd cages ?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1i0dmil/can_i_just_drill_the_case_and_mount_hdd_cages/</link><author>/u/hairystripper</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:12:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1i0dmil/can_i_just_drill_the_case_and_mount_hdd_cages/"> <img src="https://preview.redd.it/px9rsvingrce1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70bdd09cbc581f54eb069a01e01e4849d29b6c83" alt="Can I just drill the case and mount hdd cages ?

<h2 id="51contextandparticipantcharacterization">5.1. Context and Participant Characterization</h2>
<p>We decided to conduct our focus group with experienced developers of the VazaZika development team [111, 112]. The VazaZika is a gamified software that encourages policies of education in public health concerning the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya. VazaZika aims to address the need for constantly reporting mosquito breeding sites. By using 12 game design elements (avatar, badge, challenge, comment, level, notification, point, ranking, social activity, social sharing, team and vote) and 16 game rules that reward citizens by reporting mosquito breeding sites the software successfully promote the collaborative work of citizens towards disease prevention, a fruitful competition among citizens, at the same time that improving the quality of reported mosquito breeding sites [111, 112].</p>
<p>\
The VazaZika software resulted from an international research project entitled Leveraging GamiFIcation and Social Networks for Improving Prevention and Control of Zika [111, 112]. This project was performed by researchers in Software Engineering and Data Analytics from Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK). A total of 25 members participated in the project: one project manager; four development team leaders; 15 software developers, including the team leaders, distributed in two Brazilian cities, each with at least one developer per team; and seven senior researchers, five from Brazil and two from the UK. The project counted on the active contribution of a dozen Brazilian public health agents, which assisted many development activities.</p>
<p>\
From 15 software developers of the VazaZika development team, we successfully recruited four developers, including two team leaders. Table 16 provides a general view on the participants background. We have collected the table data from an online Participant Characterization Form, which we sent to participants minutes before the start of the focus group session. The team leaders are marked in Table 16 with the symbol (*).</p>
<p>\

<p>\
By observing Table 16, we can see that all participants have a high education level, all of them having a PhD in Computer Science. Also, all participants have at least ten years of experience with software development and have been involved with at least six software projects. Finally, two participants reported a high level of knowledge in gamification and game design elements (P1 and P2), and two others reported a very low (P3) and low (P4) level of knowledge. Thus, we assume that we have a balanced set of participants in terms of expertise on the specific topic. It is noteworthy that all of them actively participated as developers (or technical team lead - in the case of P1 and P2) in the gamification of the VazaZika software.</p>

<h2 id="54ontheperceivedusefulnesseaseofuseandintentofadoptionofmappednegativeeffects">5.4. On the Perceived Usefulness, Ease of use and Intent of Adoption of Mapped Negative Effects</h2>
<p>As designed, based on a simplified and direct approach on the main TAM constructs, we asked participants to assign one vote to their agreement degree on the usefulness, ease of use, and intent of adoption of information on potential negative effects of game design elements to support adoption decisions. We have collected the agreement degree by the participants in the session‚Äôs virtual mural (as illustrated in section G of Figure 7) based on a five-point Likert scale [114].</p>
<p>\
Figure 16 illustrates the level of Agreement reported by the participants.</p>
<p>\
All participants strongly agree about the usefulness of the potential negative effects of game design elements to support adoption decisions. On the other hand, only one participant partially disagrees and three participants partially agree that the information about the potential negative effects are easy to use. Finally, one participant partially agrees and three participants strongly agree on the intent to use. With regard to these questions, participant P1 mentioned that information about the negative effects are sensitive to the context of the gamified software: <em>‚Äú[‚Ä¶] depending on the context of your software, it may be that all negatives effects become positives, for instance. So, depending on the context,</em></p>

<p>\
<em>and if a catalog is created, it is very sensitive to the context of the application.‚Äù</em>. Additionally, P2 mentioned that information about negative effects is important for developers who have never implemented a gamified system: <em>‚Äú[‚Ä¶] to learn from other people‚Äôs experience, for example with a succinct catalog so that you can get information quickly and learn, I think it is extremely valuable.‚Äù.</em></p>

<p>Table 17 summarizes the collected participant feedback. This form was composed of two questions aimed at capturing the degree of confidence and comfort of the participant during the focus group session. All participants agree orstrongly agree that they were able to discuss the negative effects of each group of game design elements. Additionally, all participants strongly agree that they felt comfortable in sharing their opinion during the focus group.</p>

<h2 id="53thedevelopersperceptiononthenegativeeffects">5.3. The Developers‚Äô Perception on The Negative Effects</h2>
<p>We asked participants to assign one vote to the awareness degree on the negative effects reported in the literature and to provide us with comments on pros and cons for using the game design elements under discussion. We have collected these comments through post-it notes added by the participants in the session‚Äôs virtual mural (as illustrated in Figure 8). In order to analyze these comments, we first watched the video and audio records and transcribed them into plain text. Thereafter, we analyzed all post-it comments written by the participants and associated transcription quotes. In the following subsections, we summarize the comments that emerged for each group of game design elements.</p>
<p>\
<strong><em>5.3.1. Badges and Rewards</em></strong></p>
<p>\
Figure 9 illustrates the comments made by the participants. In this group of game design elements, three participants reported being mostly unaware, and only one participant reported being mostly aware about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative ones.</p>
<p>\
<em>Positive comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of two positive comments. <strong>Increases Extrinsic Motivation</strong>. Participant P1 mentioned that he was unaware about the negative effect of reducing intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, the participants mentioned that the use of these game design elements, in isolation or together with others, is important to increase extrinsic motivation. As mentioned by P1 and agreed by P3, as follows.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚Äúwhen we see that a player has many badges, what we expect as developers is that another player becomes more motivated, [‚Ä¶] the perception is that it increases the extrinsic motivation. However, I was unaware that [the use of badges and rewards] could reduce intrinsic motivation.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-4u83v5o.png" alt="Figure 9: Positive and Negative Comments for Badges and Rewards." /></p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúWe made some simulations using badges as part of the challenges, I would say that yes, it had a return on the motivation.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Distinguished Badges to improve engagement quality.</strong> Another positive point highlighted by the participants was the use of distinguished badges to improve engagement quality. In this sense, participant P3 mentioned that one of the strategies used to motivate users of the VazaZika software was the use of distinguished badges, which could only be won by the user under specific conditions, associated with challenges and time intervals.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] the idea of distinguished badges instead of [normal] badges that you can get doing a task anytime, [is that] you have distinguished badges associated with a certain time period, a certain challenge. So the idea would be to motivate certain periods associated with each badge.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of four negative comments. <strong>Super motivation.</strong> An interesting negative point raised by participants P2 and P3 concerns the super motivation of users in performing tasks, aimed only at winning badges and rewards. In this case, P3 also mentioned that super motivating users can lead to the introduction of false data into the software. For instance, in gamified software where the user earns badges for each check-in performed.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] In the VazaZika software, we had a badge that the user would only earn if he was in a certain location in a specific period of time [‚Ä¶]. So it was possible to increase the [data] quality, because we knew that the user who was completing this challenge was reporting real mosquito breeding sites.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
Although the presence of super motivated users has a negative effect, participant P2 also mentioned that this effect can be minimized through the definition of validation mechanisms.</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚Äú[..] in programming sites in which the user is super motivated, writing code and sending a lot of code every time. The control mechanism is good [because] it tests and verifies that the code is working. Thus, the super motivated user is not a problem in this case. It would only be a problem if the control mechanism was bad.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Validation mechanisms to avoid cheating.</strong> Another negative point mentioned by the participants was the need to introduce validation mechanisms to avoid cheating. As mentioned by participants P1 and P4.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúIn order to avoid false data, we used the vote (up and downvote) to verify and validate if that reported mosquito breeding site was really real or not.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] we had a worry that the award by itself, without any type of control mechanism, could be harmful. In our context, at the health area, that involved the work of health public agent, government actions [‚Ä¶], a greater care was needed to ensure the fidelity of information.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Cheating to Badges.</strong> Another point mentioned, and strongly related to super motivation, and the presence of validation mechanisms is the practice of cheating to badges, intending to earn more rewards as mentioned by the participant P2 as follows.</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] the player was misrepresenting the app data because he was super motivated to win the badge. However, I do not think that this avoids the bigger problem that is the false data that are entering the software, this is the big context.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Excessive focus on rewards.</strong> Finally, the participants mentioned that the use of badges and rewards can generate an excessive focus on earning rewards. According to participant P4, this may be due to the gamification software being designed to generate rewards for users after performing simple and repetitive tasks, generating a deficiency in the game‚Äôs logic.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚ÄúSo, maybe it is related to certain gamified software that have more focus in provide rewards than the game logic.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚Äú[So], if the idea is to [provide] fun, entertain and attract [the players], we need to be more careful in giving rewards for each performed task by the player. This cannot go unnoticed. We need game logic too.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>5.3.2. Competitions, Challenges and Goals</em></p>
<p>\
Figure 10 illustrates the pros and cons mentioned by the participants for Competitions, Challenges and Goals. In this group of game design elements, two participants reported a mostly unaware, and two participants reported mostly awareness about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Positive comments.</strong> The participants mentioned a total of three positive comments as follows. <strong>Communitary (social) integration</strong>. P4 mentioned that the use of competition, challenges, and goals can increase community integration. More particularity, the participant mentioned the use of these game design elements in a particular community, for instance, the citizens of a particular neighborhood can increase integration between those involved. As we can see below.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ap93v9d.png" alt="Figure 10: Positive and Negative Comments for Competitions, Challenges, and Goals." /></p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚ÄúThe context here influences a lot. I would add this type of competition as an advantage. So, if you are gamifying something that probably has a purpose of getting a result for a certain community, e.g., a industry, but specifically in our case citizens within a neighborhood or region, I see this as an opportunity for integration.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Cooperative tasks can help integrate the community.</strong> In line with the previous positive reason, participant P2 mentioned that the use of cooperative competitions, i.e., in which players come together to achieve the same goal, is more motivating than just creating competitions between players.</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚Äúif you create competitions that aren‚Äôt necessarily between players, but between players around a common goal, you can help players come together to achieve those goals. In VazaZika, we‚Äôve done that by enabling team creation.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Team effort might reduce individual efforts.</strong> Complementary, Participant P3 mentioned that depending on the type of challenge and its difficulty level, is essential that the challenge be done with two to three people. In this sense, the creation of cooperative tasks helps to reduce the effort to achieve a common goal.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúWhat I think goes against the extra effort, is that depending on the challenge, you can not do it alone, you need two to three people‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of five negative comments, as follows. <strong>Perceived extra effort.</strong> Participant P1 has mentioned that extra effort is a negative effect when challenges require physical effort. In the context of the VazaZika software, citizens had to report and validate real cases of mosquito outbreaks in loco. The participant also mentioned that even though the challenge is done in teams, the extra effort was still perceived by the citizens.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúMost of our challenges required a physical effort since the citizens had to go to a location to report or validate the existence of a mosquito breeding site, either individually or in teams. We were aware that there was an extra effort because they would have to move around.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Can demotivate casual players.</strong> Another interesting negative reason mentioned by participant P2 concerns the demotivation of casual players to participate in competitions that attract frenetic or experienced players. In other words, a casual player may feel demotivated to compete with frenetic players, whose experience level is constantly increasing due to the time spent these players in performing gamified activities in the software.</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚ÄúYou have a frenetic community of [players] who set the bar high, and for a [casual player] to participate in competitions is simply demotivating, because he cannot play casually in these competitions.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Rules might demotivate participation.</strong> Another problem associated with the demotivation of casual players is related to the definition of rules that can restrict the participation of some players in collaborative challenges. For instance, rules that involve the availability of collaborative challenges in a given time interval may restrict the participation of players who are in different time-zones. As mentioned by Participant P3 as follows.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúAnother problem is that there are some rules in competitions that make it difficult for players to participate, e.g., players who are in a completely different time zone and who want to compete with their friends from Brazil who are in another time zone. In this sense, a rule involving time restrictions discourages a player from participating in the competition.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
On the other hand, participant P4 mentioned that the definition of rules that restrict the participation of players is not always a bad design. That is the case of challenges that involve the participation of a community (a favela), or a small group of adolescents in a public school. Such challenges, although they have geographic restrictions, also stimulate the accomplishment of tasks or challenges pertinent to a certain location. For instance, a challenge to report mosquito outbreaks in a region with a public health policy deficiency.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚ÄúFor a community geographically, a favela, adolescents from a public school [‚Ä¶] it would be a stimulus, to prevent diseases [‚Ä¶]‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Rules may stop competitors to participate in the way they want.</strong> In line with the previous comment, participant P3 mentioned that some rules in addition to demotivating can stop players that want to participate in challenges. For instance, rules related to the minimum quality of participants for challenges. In this case, the software may be forcing challenges with certain characteristics that a player does not necessarily want as mentioned by participant P3 as follows.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúI remember that in the VazaZika software , some competitions could only be held by a team, and the team had a minimum amount of people. [‚Ä¶] So, the software was forcing you to enter a competition with certain characteristics that you don‚Äôt necessarily want.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Confusion to reach the goal as a team.</strong> In fact the lack of understanding can be a negative effect. More specifically, participant P1 mentioned that although instructions for completing a challenge were explicitly provided to players, in some cases they could not understand what needed to be done to complete a challenge as a team.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúThe lack of understanding could indeed have this negative effect. We tried to make it explicit what they had to do to complete a challenge, but they still couldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong><em>5.3.3. Leaderboards and Rankings</em></strong></p>
<p>\
Figure 11 illustrates the pros and cons mentioned by the participants for Leaderboards and Rankings. Similar to the previous group of game design elements, two participants reported a mostly unaware, and two participants reported mostly awareness about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Positive comments.</strong> The only positive comment mentioned was <strong>Can create pro players</strong>, by P2, where he argued that players with a higher level of ability in the game would be able to be beneficial outside it.</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚ÄúPer example, trying to get the context of a gamified system, the HackerRank, (‚Ä¶) that is a programming questions‚Äô system, the pro players there‚Ä¶ for you to be as good as them, you have to ‚Äôwaste your life‚Äô writing code and submitting questions all the time, and being approved on the tests and gaining points.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚ÄúBut the pro players in those systems are so good in algorithms that they would easily be approved on certain business interviews, you understand? So, there‚Äôs a lot of business monitoring those pro players, let‚Äôs say that. So for the industry that is monitoring the rankings, this could be a positive point. Not considering all the negative effect of the thing that can stress you, stuff like that. For the corporate world this can help somehow.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-sma3vkk.png" alt="Figure 11: Positive and Negative Comments for Leaderboards and Rankings." /></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comments.</em> There are four negative comment, starting with <strong>Depends on the profile of the players (collaborative or competitive),</strong> the participant P3 mentioned that depending on the type of player, the use of leaderboards or rankings can have a negative effect. For instance, unlike players with a competitive profile, who are motivated to get the best positions, collaborative players can feel unmotivated.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] there are those that will consider Leaderboards and Rankings as something that motivates them, ‚ÄùI want to be the first‚Äù, but there are others with a more collaborative profile, their reaction will be ‚Äùlook, I don‚Äôt want to participate and be the first‚Äù, so it depends a lot of the [‚Ä¶] players‚Äô profile.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Cooperative harassment.</strong> Participant P4 has mentioned that the use of leaderboards and rankings in a cooperative environment, mainly in the private sector, can lead to harassment or bullying of the player. In this case, participant P4 argued that in these environments, a player can use leaderboards and rankings as a form of harassment, both for those who are at the top of leaderboards/rankings and for those who are not.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] in the public sector and mixed economy, this worry with harassment, the person feeling excluded, diminished, or even demotivated. And that has a lot to do with the negative effect.[‚Ä¶] They see that as a way to reduce the other, both who is higher in the rankings/leaderboards and who is lower.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Limits of quantitative approaches (do not consider particular situations).</strong> In line with the Cooperative harassment, participant P4 mentioned that a negative aspect is the use of leaderboards and rankings heavily based on quantitative approaches. P4 argued that in situations in which a player is unable to perform tasks in the software, he will lose positions in the ranking, which would be considered unfair. For instance, in cooperative environments when a player takes sick leave, his actions are no longer quantified.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶]exceptions will always happen because we are human and there will be situations where the person will fall through the rankings and that will be considered unfair, as an example, a medic license and the person went away. And the metrics are [‚Ä¶] quantitative, and the rankings are mostly quantitative.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Can create an unfair competition</strong>. Is related to the demotivation of beginner players in achieving leadership or a similar position to players who are at the top of the leaderboard. In other words, depending on the beginner player‚Äôs current level, he may never reach the leadership as mentioned by participant P1 as follows.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúSo I think this is a cons point, because depending on what level you are, you will never reach the lead.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong><em>5.3.4. Points, XPs and Virtual Currencies</em></strong></p>
<p>\
Figure 12 illustrates the comments made by the participants for Points, XPs, and Virtual Currencies. About the awareness degree, three participants reported a mostly unaware, and one participant reported mostly awareness about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-fwb3ved.png" alt="Figure 12: Positive and Negative Comments for Points, XPs and Virtual Currencies." /></p>
<p>\
<em>Positive comments.</em> Two positive comments were made by participant P3: <strong>Build a reputation mechanism</strong> and <strong>It increases reliability</strong>. Participant P3 exemplified that in systems such as Stack Overflow, a gamified system of questions and answers about programming problems, the use of points helps to build a reputation in terms of the player‚Äôs level of experience in response to specific answers. At the same time, responses from highly reputable players are considered highly reliable.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúFor instance, let‚Äôs think about the case of Stack Overflow, that is a gamified system where sometimes you want to search an answer to a solution, then you have two possibilities, which one you choose first? The one of the user with the highest XP. [‚Ä¶].‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comment.</em> The participants P2 and P4 mentioned that <strong>There are games that allow paying to win, demotivating others</strong> as a negative reason. In this sense, P2 discussed the negative effects of virtual currencies in allowing players to obtain advantages over other players (pay to win).</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real option. And then you have games with a mechanic of paying to have advantages upon other players. This creates a demotivation. It‚Äôs what people calls as pay to win.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
Participant P4 also argued that the use of virtual currencies, which facilitates the practice of pay to win, can discourage players who continually perform actions in the software in order to advance in the game.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚ÄúI agree a lot with P2. I can‚Äôt see the gamification context, it does not occur to me that it would be worthy to give coin or the opportunity to pay to play, I can‚Äôt see it, because usually the serious game, you will gamify a thing there to fix an issue, how are you going to add payment there? Why when you pay to achieve something without a fight for that, so that is done only to brag about the achievement. But in a serious game you have to do things, you have to solve problems. So, how can you in this context use a coin, not only as money but being able to pay to gain the money? Then in this pay to win, I agree completely with P2, and I can‚Äôt see, can‚Äôt glimpse in the serious game context that you would pay to win.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong><em>5.3.5. Feedback and Achievements</em></strong></p>
<p>\
Figure 13 illustrates the comments made by the participants for Feedback and Achievements. In this group of game design elements, two participants were completely unaware, one participant was mostly unaware, and one participant as mostly aware of the negative effects. We detail each reason as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>
<p>\
<em>Positive comments.</em> <strong>Public feedbacks may serve as hints for other users</strong> and <strong>Achievements-driven players can play and contribute more.</strong> P1 added that public feedbacks would be advantageous to engage the users. In other words, users can feel motivated, realizing that other users are performing tasks and being rewarded for them.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-i6c3veo.png" alt="Figure 13: Positive and Negative Comments for Feedback and Achievements." /></p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúSo, there‚Äôs that question about various gamification elements, but in truth, it has the same meaning. I think, this was our case, in relation to the list of activities that the citizen would be able to do, I don‚Äôt know if you all agree, but when we say to the other citizens that that player, that citizen, did an activity with success, I believe that it is a valid feedback form to other participants, even as a way to engage. So-and-so is reporting small flies at that region. Hey I‚Äôm also going there because theoretically there‚Äôs a high concentration, or something like that.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Difficult to perceive feedback as negative.</strong> Participant P3 mentioned that the use of feedback should be considered in any software. In gamified software , its use is more intensive because when the user performing a task with with reward, the user must always be informed.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] Feedback is something that must be considered in any software development. [‚Ä¶]. So, as a gamified software this should be even more prominent, because, you start doing a lot of different achievements and you don‚Äôt get any response from the software that you‚Äôre changing levels and getting a badge. So it‚Äôs a little difficult for me to see that lack of effect is a negative feedback effect.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comments.</em> <strong>Excessive feedback might be a problem</strong> and <strong>Massive use of feedback.</strong> The Participant P3 have mentioned that the excessive use of feedback results in a negative and intrusive effect for the user of the software .</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúMaybe it can be bad when you receive too much feedback. For instance, I logged into the software , and I get a notification, anything you do on the software gets feedback. So maybe there is a negative and intrusive effect.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong><em>5.3.6. Avatar</em></strong></p>
<p>\
Figure 14 illustrates the comments made by the participants for Avatars. Three participants were completely unaware, and only one participant was completely aware about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-otd3vcr.png" alt="Figure 14: Positive and Negative Comments for Avatars." /></p>
<p>\
<strong>Positive comments.</strong> The participants have mentioned a total of four positive and one negative comments as follows. <strong>Basic characteristics of any game, enables customizing the users.</strong> P1 and P3 have mentioned Avatar is a basic characteristic of any gamified software . Even more so today, in which everyone wants to differentiate themselves, and in this case an avatar can express that difference.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúIn the same way that XP is considered a basic feature of any game, Avatar is too. Even more so nowadays, when everyone wants to differentiate themselves, and you don‚Äôt have an avatar that can express that difference. For me or at least for most users it is a core feature of the software.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
Additionally, participant P1 mentioned that from the end user‚Äôs point of view, there is no extra effort in selecting an avatar‚Äôs characteristics. P1 also mentioned that setting up an avatar is normally part of the initial setup of any game.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúFrom the end user‚Äôs point of view, I don‚Äôt think it takes too much effort. Also, as P3 mentioned, if you were going to play some other game, or even some gamified software, a step in the tutorial is to create your avatar.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Self-expression brings engagement.</strong> The participant P4 have mentioned that in gamified software s that focus on a younger audience, the use of avatars leads to greater engagement, mainly due to the capacity for self-expression.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs a thing that it must exist, because some like it, mainly the young public.[‚Ä¶]‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Development effort might pay off (e.g., engag</strong>ement). Participant P2 has mentioned that despite the development effort required to add an avatar as a feature into the software, the effort might pay off, especially if the avatar increases user engagement in the software.</p>
<p>\
<em>P2: ‚ÄúUnderstood. Because, even if it demands effort from the developer to create the activity, if me manages to engage (‚Ä¶), even if just 10% or 20% of the users, it would be worthwhile.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comment.</em> The participants P1 and P4 mentioned that an <strong>Extra effort was indeed considered in the gamified software, and only basic avatars were used.</strong> More specifically, P1, mentioned that the creation of sophisticated avatars requires the customization of different items, e.g., hair, clothes, skin color, which consumes development time (one of the main constraints of the VazaZika project).</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúFrom the developer‚Äôs point of view, in VazaZika we didn‚Äôt have a sophisticated avatar where you could choose your hair, clothes, skin color, etc. One of the comments for this was extra effort, and time restrictions.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
Participant P4 also mentioned that the extra effort is also related to the constant need to make new items available for the avatar, which are often driven by external trends, associated with the need for a professional with design skills.</p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚ÄúWho chooses and customizes an Avatar is an identity mechanism, the person will continually update the Avatar. Something happened, I‚Äôll update the avatar. Changed a trend, a fashion, I‚Äôll update. It‚Äôs how I change clothes. I update the avatar all the time.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>P4: ‚Äú(‚Ä¶)because it‚Äôs something that demands much more design, so it must have a designer, someone that would work with that part.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong><em>5.3.7. Quizzes</em></strong></p>
<p>\
Figure 15 illustrates the comments made by the participants. Two participants were mostly unaware, and two mostly aware of the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>
<p>\
<em>Positive comment.</em> The participants mentioned one positive comment: <strong>Might Help To Achieve Educational Purposes Participant</strong> P1 mentioned that, although quizzes were not added to VazaZika software, the quizzes were considered in the early phases of VazaZika software design. The same participant also mentioned that an advantage of using quizzes is enabling achieving educational purposes.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-kte3vow.png" alt="Figure 15: Positive and Negative Comments for Quizzes." /></p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚ÄúI think that the advantage is when you want to gamify in this educational sense. So, in our software the advantage would be that we would be making the citizen be more conscious about the peculiarities of the small fly and its focus. So, how to combat the focus? Which is the time period with more incidence? [‚Ä¶]‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>Negative comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of three negative comments as follows. Boring task. P1 mentioned that compared to other gamified tasks, answering questions can demotivate players.</p>
<p>\
<em>P1: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] only answering questions really is a bit boring, if compared with other tasks that the game would offer.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Frustration after getting wrong answers.</strong> In line with P1, participant P3 elaborated on the possible negative effect of using quizzes is the frustration when a user gives a wrong answer to a question, generating pressure to get it right.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúFirst that I don‚Äôt like quizzes, but there are cases where you have to do, right, you don‚Äôt have a choice. But there‚Äôs that pressure of having to get it right, and when you don‚Äôt, you stay with that [‚Ä¶] frustration, and I always see it as a negative effect.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúEven more when you are in an educational software, where the person answering the quiz wants to get it right and when it doesn‚Äôt, or has the pressure to, or gets frustrated.[‚Ä¶]‚Äù</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Risk of repetition.</strong> The use of traditional quizzes may have the risk of repetition, resulting in the lack of motivation of the players as pointed by P3 as follows.</p>
<p>\
<em>P3: ‚ÄúThe repetition risk that I added here, its obvious that there are a lot of mechanisms to avoid [it], but a more conventional quiz where you raffle questions in a small group always have that.‚Äù</em></p>

In an interview streamed on X.com, Musk says "We've got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they're all working well," according to The Times of India:

"We upgraded the devices, they'll have more electrodes, basically higher bandwidth, longer battery life and everything. So, expect 20 or 30 patients this year with the upgraded Neuralink devices...." 

"[O]ur next part will be Blindsight devices where even if somebody has lost both eyes or has lost the optic nerve, we can interface directly with the visual cortex in the brain and enable them to see. We already have that working in monkeys," Musk added.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Among the many groups hoping for greater representation in the new Syria is the country's Kurdish minority. During Syria's civil war, Syrian Democratic Forces - SDF - rebels fought to create a semi-autonomous area for the Kurdish population. 
About 10 percent of Syrians are ethnic Kurds. They're settled mostly in the north, along the border with Turkey, which has its own sizeable Kurdish minority.  The Syrian border city of Kobane is home to some 50,000 people, and local Kurds are increasingly fearful that Turkey could try to seize their city.

Unraid or Linux distro only. I have an unused basic unraid license around, I could also use that, even if it seems overkill.</li> <li>No need for dockers or app on this, just a storage (maybe I would use a RAID1 just for a bit more data security - I know RAID is not a backup, but this is the 3rd backup of my important data i would have)</li> <li>I have some 4TB disks around, so I do not have to buy them.</li> </ul> <p>I thought of a three solutions, but I am open to more of them:</p> <p>1) Buy something like a Ugreen DXP2800, 2 bay prebuilt NAS but where I can install Linux or boot unraid. But it is not cheap (around 300 euros), but it has modern hardware (potentially good even if not needed now), low power consumption.</p> <p>2) Reuse the HP Microserver, but leaving it off if not in use (idle power is around 40/50w, and fan is noisy), and buy a cheap/used Raspberry PI to leave it on 24/7 to have the possibility to wake on lan the HP. Or also something else that just sits there in the network (but securely) and could send the magic packet. In case the storage is needed for my friend use, he can just power the system up using the power button.</p> <p>3) Buy a Raspberry PI/mini pc and a 2bay USB Hard Drive enclosure. But I see different opinions for reliability of these enclosures, and of course more cost as I have to buy everything.</p> <p>What would you suggest?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Abracadibra"> /u/Abracadibra </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i0br5f/need_opinion_best_solution_for_offsite_backup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i0br5f/need_opinion_best_solution_for_offsite_backup/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What were Joe Biden&apos;s foreign policy successes and failures? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6culWfScwE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden is preparing to give a final foreign policy address in a few hours.

The first law of soca music, according to Machel Montano, is: "it's dancing time all the time." And in his Tiny Desk Concert, the "King of Soca" provides irrefutable evidence to support that statement.

Montano's performance is the first to bring soca, the high energy dance music of the Caribbean, to the Tiny Desk. The genre was born in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 1970s when calypso artist Lord Shorty (who later chose the name Ras Shorty I) added traditional Indian percussion instruments and rhythms to calypso music ‚Äî itself a fusion that incorporates elements of African, Venezuelan, French and American music.

A proud Trinidadian, Montano's contribution to soca has earned him awards and recognition since his youth. His career began in earnest when he was 7 years old, and by the time he was 10, he'd shared the stage with Calypsonian pioneers and icons, most notably performing at Madison Square Garden with Mighty Sparrow, Lord Kitchener and The Mighty Shadow.

Indeed, Montano's Tiny Desk Concert was representative of his 40-plus-year career and, to the delight of those in attendance, included some of his biggest hits: "One More Time," "Famalay," "Like Ah Boss" and "Soca Kingdom."

Guests who attended Montano's performance came ready to f√™te! They jumped, they wined and they waved the flags of their respective Caribbean islands up high, singing along word for word. Being a Barbados-born, Saint Lucian-bred gyal, seeing and feeling the spirit of unity inherent to the cultural sound ingrained in my DNA ‚Äî and foundational to my upbringing ‚Äî represented at Tiny Desk made me beam with pride. If this is your first exposure to soca music, I suggest you stretch and loosen up your waistline before pushing play on this one, because there is no sitting still when soca fills the room.

Legal Skirmish Continues</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0323229/oracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Oracle has informed us they won't voluntarily withdraw their trademark on 'JavaScript'." That's the word coming from the company behind Deno, the alternative JavaScript/TypeScript/WebAssembly runtime, which is pursuing a formal cancellation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

So what happens next? Oracle "will file their Answer, and we'll start discovery to show how 'JavaScript' is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle." Deno's social media posts show a schedule of various court dates that extend through July of 2026, so "The dispute between Oracle and Deno Land could go on for quite a while," reports InfoWorld:
Deno Land co-founder Ryan Dahl, creator of both the Deno and Node.js runtimes, said a formal answer from Oracle is expected before February 3, unless Oracle extends the deadline again. "After that, we will begin the process of discovery, which is where the real legal work begins. It will be interesting to see how Oracle argues against our claims &mdash; genericide, fraud on the USPTO, and non-use of the mark." 

The legal process begins with a discovery conference by March 5, with discovery closing by September 1, followed by pretrial disclosure from October 16 to December 15. An optional request for an oral hearing is due by July 8, 2026. 

Oracle took ownership of JavaScript's trademark in 2009 when it purchased Sun Microsystems, InfoWorld notes. 

But "Oracle does not control (and has never controlled) any aspect of the specification or how the phrase 'JavaScript' can be used by others," argues an official petition filed by Deno Land Inc. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
Today, millions of companies, universities, academics, and programmers, including Petitioner, use "JavaScript" daily without any involvement with Oracle. The phrase "JavaScript" does not belong to one corporation. It belongs to the public. JavaScript is the generic name for one of the bedrock languages of modern programming, and, therefore, the Registered Mark must be canceled. 

An open letter to Oracle discussing the genericness of the phrase "JavaScript," published at https://javascript.tm/, was signed by 14,000+ individuals at the time of this Petition to Cancel, including notable figures such as Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and the current editors of the JavaScript specification, Michael Ficarra and Shu-yu Guo. There is broad industry and public consensus that the term "JavaScript" is generic. 

The seven-page petition goes into great detail, reports InfoWorld. "Deno Land also accused Oracle of committing fraud in its trademark renewal efforts in 2019 by submitting screen captures of the website of JavaScript runtime Node.js, even though Node.js was not affiliated with Oracle."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

We're reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt." 

But soon Blue Origin will again attempt its very first orbital flight. And they'll also attempt to land their reusable Stage 1 on a drone in the Atlantic ocean... 

Several hours Sunday night their rocket was fueled on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, awaiting ignition. Its three-hour launch window had just opened. And Blue Origin was webcasting it all live on their web page... 

But whatever happened, Ars Technica's senior space editor Eric Berger got to talk to an "affable and anxious" Jeff Bezos:


"It's pretty exciting, isn't it?" Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, said by way of greeting... I asked what his expectations were for the launch of New Glenn, which has a three-hour window that opens at 1 am ET (06:00 UTC) on Monday, January 13... "We would certainly like to achieve orbit, and get the Blue Ring Pathfinder into orbit," Bezos said. "Landing the booster would be gravy on top of that. It's kind of insane to try and land the booster. A more sane approach would probably be to try to land it into ocean. But we're gonna go for it." 

Blue Origin has built a considerable amount of infrastructure on a drone ship, Jacklyn, that will be waiting offshore for the rocket to land upon. Was Bezos not concerned about putting that hardware at risk? "I'm worried about everything," he admitted. However, the rocket has been programmed to divert from the ship if the avionics on board the vehicle sense that anything is off-nominal. And there is, of course, a pretty good chance of that happening. "We've done a lot of work, we've done a lot of testing, but there are some things that can only be tested in flight," Bezos said. "And you can't be overconfident in these things... The reality is, there are a lot of things that go wrong, and you have to accept that, if something goes wrong, we'll pick ourselves up and get busy for the second flight." 

Bezos also pointed out that 7% of all the people who have ever flown into space have done so on a Blue Origin vehicle &mdash; including himself, an experience he told Ars Technica "is kind of hard to beat... That really was very meaningful for a whole bunch of reasons. 

"But this is, you know, the culmination of a lot of hard work by a lot of people. And it's a really big deal. You know, you don't get very many first flights, yeah, and here we go." 

The rocket's payload nose cone (or fairing) has the signatures of thousands of Blue Origin employees, according to a Blue Origin post on Instagram, calling it "a tribute to the hard work and passion for mission we all have here..." More details about the launch:

 Space.com notes that the launch "was initially scheduled for Jan. 10 and then Jan. 12, but Blue Origin postponed it due to rough offshore weather that could affect a rocket landing on the company's recovery ship in the Atlantic." Space Force officials forecast the chance of good liftoff conditions Sunday night were 50%.

"We want to be clear about our objectives," Blue Origin posted Sunday on X.com. "This is our first flight and we've prepared rigorously for it. But no amount of ground testing or mission simulations is a replacement for flying this rocket. Our key objective today is to reach orbit safely. Anything beyond that is icing on the cake. We know landing the booster on our first try offshore in the Atlantic is ambitious &mdash; but we're going for it. No matter what happens, we'll learn, refine, and apply that knowledge to our next launch."




While Blue Origin's "New Shephard" capsule can hold up to six passengers, the New Glenn's capsule has 30 times that capacity.

Space.com notes the rocket is carrying a payload: a test version of the company's new 'Blue Ring' spacecraft platform to validate its orbit-to-ground communications capabilities.

To get the next generation excited about space travel, Blue Origin's web site is selling an 11.5-inch , 636-piece model of the New Glenn rocket (complete with a retractable launch tower).<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>Hi HN. I'm the president and founder of a small non-profit called Reclaim The Records that identifies historical and genealogical materials and data sets held by government agencies, archives, and libraries -- and then returns them to the public domain, for free public use.<p>Back in September 2017, our organization made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) asking for a copy of a database they maintain called "BIRLS", which stands for the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem. While it's not exactly an index of every single post-Civil-War veteran of every branch of the US military, it's possibly the closest thing that exists to it.<p>BIRLS is a database that indexes all the known-to-the-VA-in-or-after-the-1970s *<i>veterans' benefits claims files*</i>, also called C-Files or sometimes XC-Files. Older veterans' claims files have been moved to the National Archives (NARA), such as the famous Civil War pension files. But 95% of the later benefits claim files, from the late nineteenth century up to today, are still held at the VA, in their warehouses, and still haven't been sent to NARA.<p>And even if you know these files exist, the VA really doesn't make it easy to get them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) group within the VA only seems to accept FOIA requests for copies of C-Files by fax (!) and also seems to have made up a whole new rule whereby you have to have an actual wet ink signature on your FOIA request, not just a typed letter.<p>Well, seven years and one very successful FOIA lawsuit in SDNY against the VA later, we at Reclaim The Records are very proud to announce the acquisition and first-ever free public release of the BIRLS database, AND that we built a new website to make the data freely and easily searchable AND that we even built a free FOIA-by-FAX-API system (with a signature widget, to get around the dumb new not-FOIA rules!) built into our website's search results, that makes it much, much easier for people to finally get these files out of the VA warehouses and into your mailbox. :-)<p>We also added the ability to do searches through the data for soundalike names, abbreviated names, common nicknames, wildcards, searches by date of birth or death, or ranges of birth and death years, or search by SSN, or by branch(es) of services, or by gender...<p>For a lot more information about our FOIA lawsuit against the VA for the database, including copies of our court papers and the SDNY judge's order:<p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/reclaimtherecords/the-birls-database-goes-online-with-eighteen-million-us-veteran-records-and-free-foia-by-fax-system" rel="nofollow">https://mailchi.mp/reclaimtherecords/the-birls-database-goes...</a><p>As for the tech stuff, actually building the website, the search engine, and its FOIAing capability...well, it has been a pretty fun project to build.<p>The BIRLS dataset was eventually provided to us by the VA (several years after we originally asked for it...) as a large zip file which, when decompressed via the command line, yielded the hilarious file name of *<i>Redacted_Full.csv*</i>. I then loaded the cleaned CSV data into a MySQL database, and then used a modified version of the Apache Solr search engine to index the data, so that it could become searchable by soundalike names (using Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching), nicknames (using Solr's synonyms feature), partial names (using wildcards), with dates converted to ISO 8601 format to enable both exact date and date range searches, and various other search criteria.<p>The front-end of the website is built with Nuxt and hosted on Digital Ocean's App Platform, with backups of the FOIA request data on the cloud storage service Wasabi. The fax interface for submitting FOIA requests is powered by the Notifyre API. We use Mailchimp to send e-mail newsletters, and their product Mandrill for programmatic e-mail sending. We use Sentry for error monitoring, Better Stack for server logging, and TinyBird to collect FOIA submission analytics.<p>Enjoy!</p>

High winds are forecast through Wednesday, and the city's fire chief says the threat is still 'very high'. 
24 people have now been confirmed dead, with more than a dozen missing. California's governor is launching a fund to rebuild areas devastated by the fires. DW's Stefan Simons has visited communities whose losses have brought them closer together.

Or am I doing this all wrong.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeRoLiM1T"> /u/ZeRoLiM1T </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i02rzl/optomizing_zfs_for_unraid_70/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i02rzl/optomizing_zfs_for_unraid_70/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will Nvidia Spark a New Generation of Linux PCs?</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/006249/will-nvidia-spark-a-new-generation-of-linux-pcs?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 01:07:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["I know, I know: 'Year of the Linux desktop ... yadda, yadda'," writes Steven Vaughan-Nichols, a ZDNet senior contributing editor. "You've heard it all before. But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want..." 

He's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as "a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro."

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players &mdash; including Intel and AMD &mdash; in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>I made a Doom source port that runs within a PDF file.<p>I was inspired by the recent HN post about Tetris in a PDF (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645218">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645218</a>) and I wondered if I could get Doom to run using a similar method.<p>It turns out that old versions of Emscripten can compile C to asm.js code that will happily run inside the limited JS runtime of the PDF engine. I used the doomgeneric (<a href="https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric">https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric</a>) fork of the original Doom source, as that made writing the IO fairly easy. All I had to do was implement a framebuffer and keyboard inputs.<p>Unlike previous interactive PDF demos, the output for DoomPDF is achieved by creating a text field for each row of pixels in the screen, then setting their contents to various ASCII characters. This gives me a 6 color monochrome display, that can be updated reasonably quickly (80ms per frame).<p>The source code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/ading2210/doompdf">https://github.com/ading2210/doompdf</a><p>Note that this PDF can only run in Chromium-based browsers that use the PDFium engine.</p>

Despite the rat plague and the typhoon risk. In New York City, too, there were simple dwellings for servants on rooftops - long before penthouses and rooftop bars came along.

Like thousands of other people in Hong Kong, Cheng Chung Au lives in an illegally constructed ‚Äòcage flat‚Äô on the roof of a high-rise building. Over the decades, he‚Äôs come to terms with the rats and the typhoons. He and his wife couldn‚Äôt afford a regular flat and the waiting lists for social housing are long.

Until the early 20th century, there was also a ‚Äòcity above the city‚Äô in New York - for servants and workers. Then these very same spaces were developed into exclusive penthouse flats and rooftop bars. In the 1920s, plans for the Rockefeller Centre complex in Midtown Manhattan included rooftop gardens that were envisioned as a public park, with bridges to other buildings. The Great Depression prevented the project‚Äôs realization. 

Today, apartments on the upper levels of New York's mega-high-rise buildings are on the markets for hundreds of millions of dollars. In the future, newly constructed buildings with roof surfaces in the US metropolis will have to be greened or fitted with solar panels. Greenery can prevent sewers from overflowing during heavy rainfall. And the insulating effect of soil and vegetation saves cooling and heating energy. For activist Anastasia Cole Plakias, whose Brooklyn Grange is one of the largest rooftop farms in the US, the potential of green roofs is far from exhausted. 

Rooftops are extreme zones: A refuge for people looking for a home, and a testing ground for the city of the future.

Since 1999, I've written a huge amount of PHP code, for dozens of applications and websites. Most of it has been continually updated, and remains active and in-production, in one form or another. 

Here's the thing. It's all hand-written using vi, even to this day. 

Is there any benefit to migrating this codebase to a more modern PHP framework, like Laravel? And is there an easy and minimally intrusive way this can be done en-masse, across dozens of applications and websites? 

Or at this point should I just stick with vi?

ABSTRACT
In his book, Agile Design Patterns, Robert C. Martin introduces the #SOLID #DesignPrincipals as cornerstones for the construction of software that amenable to change.

Part of a larger set of design principals1, the SOLID principals are closely associated with object oriented languages like C++, Java, C#, and more recently Ruby. And although they span different eras, all these languages share the same class structured, inheritance based foundations.

#Go is one of a set of new languages that eschew inheritance, instead preferring the mantra of composition. Does this mean that Go programs do not follow the SOLID design principals, or even that Go is not an object oriented language?

In this talk I will explore the five core SOLID design patterns, discuss their applicability to Go programmers, and explain that while Go programs are not inheritance or class based, they adhere strongly to Martin‚Äôs principals. The audience will learn how well structured Go applications naturally follow the SOLID principals, leading to code which is loosely coupled, highly reusable, and inherently maintainable.

The power struggles, battles, and royal intrigues spanned over 30 years, leading to the decisive Battle of Bosworth and the rise of the Tudor dynasty.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, joined by co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly, dives into the mysterious world of hypnosis with clinical psychiatrist David Spiegel. What is hypnosis? Is it about losing control‚Äîor gaining it?

We explore the human mind and consciousness, asking if there‚Äôs a ‚Äúuser manual‚Äù for our brains. How does hypnosis work? Dr. Spiegel explains how our salience network, which processes external stimuli, can be ‚Äúturned down,‚Äù allowing us to engage deeply with our inner thoughts. Could this altered state offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?

Some are more hypnotizable than others‚Äîwhy? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic‚Äîtargeted and potent, especially for managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well as for good? 

From recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis reveals its potential‚Äîand limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize medicine.

Toshiko Tanaka, then six years old, had survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. She hoped that this "peace constitution‚Äù would prevent wars in the future. But now, Japan is arming itself again.

After 1945, Japan was the only country in the world to commit itself to renouncing war in its constitution. But in the face of increasing dangers, the island nation has now announced a rearmament program. By the end of this decade, Japan could become the third strongest military power in the world. The pacifism born of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has given way to fear of aggressive neighbors like China, Russia and North Korea.
Under conservative governments and in view of the increasing withdrawal of the once-protective USA, the Japanese armed forces have acquired weapons systems. These include amphibious vehicles, US F-35 fighter jets and two aircraft carriers. There is enough plutonium from civilian use in the country to produce up to a thousand nuclear warheads. Missile systems are also available.
Asia is the key to the future. This documentary shows a new side of Japan and provides insight into the military changes that are taking place there - far from the war in Ukraine. Toshiko Tanaka, one of the last hibakusha, as the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings are called, fears war once more.

<p>Hello everyone, there are many log services available and this is my attempt at a better one.<p>Most online logging tools feature convoluted UIs, arbitrary mandatory fields, questionable AI/insights, complex pricing, etc. I hope my application fixes most of these issues. It also has some nice features, such as automatic Geo IP checks and public dashboards.<p>Although I've created lots of software, this is my first open source application (MIT license), the tutorial for selfhosting is hopefully sufficient! Most of my development career has been with C#, NodeJS and PHP. For this project I've used PHP (8.3) which is an absolute joy to work with. The architecture is very scalable, but I've only tested up to a few billion logs. The current version is used in production for a few months now. Hope you enjoy/fork it as you see fit!</p>

ABSTRACT
Moving to a microservice architecture and embracing a cloud native approach is a complex challenge, which often requires re-evaluating our approach to technology. Having previously helped transition Hailo to a a new microservice platform, built almost entirely in Go, Matt leverages modern technologies and a microservice based approach to build reliable platforms which can scale to millions of users. This talk will cover how to develop and migrate to a microservice based architecture using Go, common pitfalls to avoid, and lessons learnt when developing high volume, low latency, distributed applications.

              <p>While worrying about AI takeover might seem like a modern idea that sprung from <em>War Games</em> or <em>The Terminator</em>, it turns out that a similar concern about machine dominance dates back to the time of the American Civil War, albeit from an English <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3235/pg3235-images.html">sheep farmer</a> living in New Zealand. Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1863, a letter <a href="https://diogenesii.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/darwin-among-the-machines.pdf">published</a> in The Press newspaper of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch">Christchurch</a> warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence‚Äîand the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.</p>
<p>Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently <a href="https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1876982690508910917">popped up</a> again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the <span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Institute for AI Policy and Strategy</span>. The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/161-years-ago-a-new-zealand-sheep-farmer-predicted-ai-doom/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a "hacking-as-a-service" scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company‚Äôs platform for AI-generated content.</p>
<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/10/taking-legal-action-to-protect-the-public-from-abusive-ai-generated-content/">said</a> Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft‚Äôs Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use.</p>
<h2>A sophisticated scheme</h2>
<p>Microsoft is also suing seven individuals it says were customers of the service. All 10 defendants were named John Doe because Microsoft doesn‚Äôt know their identity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-sues-service-for-creating-illicit-content-with-its-ai-platform/">Read full article</a></p>

PowerSchool says its cloud-based student information system is used by 18,000 customers around the globe, including the US and Canada, to handle grading, attendance records, and personal information of more than 60 million K-12 students and teachers. On December 28 someone managed to get into its systems and access their contents "using a compromised credential," the California-based biz told its clients in an email seen by Register this week.
 
[...] "We believe the unauthorized actor extracted two tables within the student information system database," a spokesperson told us. "These tables primarily include contact information with data elements such as name and address information for families and educators. "For a certain subset of the customers, these tables may also include Social Security Number, other personally identifiable information, and limited medical and grade information. "Not all PowerSchool student information system customers were impacted, and we anticipate that only a subset of impacted customers will have notification obligations." While the company has tightened security measures and offered identity protection services to affected individuals, cybersecurity firm Cyble suggests the intrusion "may have been more serious and gone on much longer than has been publicly acknowledged so far," reports The Register. The cybersecurity vendor says the intrusion could have occurred as far back as June 16, 2011, with it ending on January 2 of this year.
 
"Critical systems and applications such as Oracle Netsuite ERP, HR software UltiPro, Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitLab, and sensitive credentials for platforms like Microsoft login, LogMeIn, Windows AD Azure, and BeyondTrust" may have been compromised, too.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>I'm working on a GPS track visualizer for quite some time. It shines in hilly and mountaineous terrain (where a 3D view makes more sense), but it also offers quite a lot of Strava-like features (statistics etc.).<p>You can upload your GPX and FIT files manually, or sync directly with Garmin, Coros and Polar.<p>See <a href="https://cubetrek.com" rel="nofollow">https://cubetrek.com</a> for the live app and check out some examples there. It's free and opens source.<p>Also, anyone who likes to work with 3D visualizations (especially Babylon.js), let me know if you like to help polish this thing further.</p>

              <p>On Wednesday, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/future-of-jobs-report-2025-jobs-of-the-future-and-the-skills-you-need-to-get-them/">Future of Jobs Report 2025</a>, with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/business/ai-job-losses-by-2030-intl/index.html">CNN immediately highlighting</a> the finding that 40 percent of companies plan workforce reductions due to AI automation. But the report's broader analysis paints a far more nuanced picture than CNN's headline suggests: It finds that AI could create 170 million new jobs globally while eliminating 92 million positions, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs by 2030.</p>
<p>"Half of employers plan to re-orient their business in response to AI," writes the WEF in the report. "Two-thirds plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks."</p>
<p>The survey collected data from 1,000 companies that employ 14 million workers globally.

Trump says the U.S. needs the island for ‚Äúnational security purposes,‚Äù but Greenland has been tied both politically and culturally with Denmark for decades. The Arctic island has vast deposits in rare earths, oil and gas, also making it a focal point for other rivals including China and Russia. But can Trump actually purchase the territory from Denmark?

WSJ explores why any U.S. bid for the Danish territory is complicated and controversial.

Rita was born in Togo in 1991 and was raised by her grandparents. For a long time, she thought they were her parents. Hers was a happy childhood - but it ended abruptly.

At the age of nine, she‚Äòs told that her biological mother lives in Munich and from now on, she must live with her.  Rita travels to Germany alone, where she receives a rather cold reception from her supposed mother. When Rita is abused by an acquaintance of her mother's, she‚Äôs too afraid to say anything.

With the help of her friends and a teacher, Rita finally moves into a child protection centre. Rita's suspicion that this woman is not her mother at all becomes more and more entrenched. A relative confesses to her that she is in fact her aunt and that her real mother lives in Togo. 

Rita bounces back from the shock and at the age of 17, she begins a course in restaurant management. Everything seems to be going well, but the traumas of her childhood soon catch up with her. After several unsuccessful suicide attempts, Rita realizes: to get answers to her questions, she needs to travel to Togo. There, she uncovers layer upon layer of lies.

Back in 2013 a couple random dudes decided to make a pseudo-sequel to Footprints in Stone called Forbidden History: Footprints in Stone II, which is essentially just an extended interview with Carl Baugh and his protegee Aaron Judkins. I was really tempted to call this video Footprints in Stone III, but restrained myself and consigned that in-joke to the clickbait title.

ABSTRACT
In a cloud environment, where horizontal and vertical scaling are relatively easy and frictionless, engineers are often forced to choose between cost and stability.

This talk posits that the cost versus stability trade-off is frequently imaginary. Stable systems are cost-effective systems. Join Cat to explore real-world examples of how focusing on stability can yield cost savings in a cloud environment. These real-world examples will also show how to frame engineering decisions in a way that accurately weighs cost and stability concerns, amongst others.

This talk is well suited for application engineers, performance engineers, architects, and finops professionals. Some experience with cloud environments is helpful but not necessarily needed. [...]

RFK, Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. 

The US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. 

Fluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains ‚Äî and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.

DESCRIPTION
Julian Wood and Sam Newman delve into the complexities of software architecture, focusing on critical concepts such as microservices, asynchronous communication, and the importance of architectural decision-making.
Sam emphasizes the need for clear definitions in computing, particularly around terms like asynchronicity, advocating for an understanding of communication styles‚Äîevent-driven versus request-response‚Äîas pivotal for effective system design. They discuss the value of architectural decision records (ADRs) as tools for fostering collaboration and documenting trade-offs in decision-making.

Additionally, the conversation highlights the evolving role of AI in software development, stressing that while AI can assist in understanding and maintaining existing codebases, the human element of critical thinking remains essential in navigating the complexities of modern software systems.

Trump‚Äôs nomination of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to be chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission has provided support for that enthusiasm. It also helped Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time, a significant milestone after 16 years of boom and bust. But for the average American, crypto still comes with plenty of risks.

              <p>The Internet has become the most prevalent communications technology the world has ever seen. Though there are more fixed and mobile telephone connections, even they use Internet technology in their core. For all the many uses the Internet allows for today, its origins lie in the cold war and the need for a defense communications network that could survive a nuclear strike. But that defense communications network quickly became used for general communications and within only a few years of the first transmission, traffic on the predecessor to today‚Äôs Internet was already 75 percent email.</p>
<h2>In the beginning</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET">Arpanet</a> was the vital precursor of today‚Äôs Internet, commissioned by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1969. In his interesting account of <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/an/2011/03/man2011030004/13rRUxly9fL">why Arpanet came about</a>, Stephen Lukasic, director of DARPA from 1970‚Äì75, wrote that if its true nature and impact had been realized it would never have been permitted under the US government structure of the time. The concept for a decentralized communications technology that would survive a nuclear attack would have placed it outside DARPA‚Äôs remit (as defense communications specifically were assigned to a different agency), so the focus changed to how to connect computers together so that major applications could be run on the most appropriate system available.</p>
<p>This was in the era of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/time-sharing">time-sharing computers</a>. Today‚Äôs familiar world of the ubiquitous ‚Äúpersonal computer‚Äù on each desk was decades away. Computers of this time were generally very large, filling entire rooms, and comparatively rare. Users working at connected terminals would submit jobs to the computer that would allocate processing time for the job when available. The idea went that if these computers were networked together, an available remote computer could process a job even when the computers closer to the users were full. The resulting network was called Arpanet, and the first packets of data traversed the network in September 1969.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/how-the-uk-was-connected-to-the-internet-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>I work for government agency with a lot of security considerations. We can't install anything and using public webapps is out of the question. Going through clearance or procurement to buy or install something is a pain.<p>I needed a project management tool, and what we had on offer was too clunky and old. I built SimpleGantt to be ultra lightweight and portable. It's one HTML, one Javascript and one CSS file. Each project is saved into a single .yaml file.<p>If you have a SharePoint environment you can "host" it by uploading the repo to SharePoint after renaming simplegantt.html to simplegantt.aspx. That allows anyone with access to open the tool by simply having the URL.<p>Try it at: <a href="https://aerugo.github.io/simplegantt/simplegantt" rel="nofollow">https://aerugo.github.io/simplegantt/simplegantt</a><p>This is a couple of days of tinkering, and mostly exists to keep me from going crazy while managing projects with lots of deadlines and dependencies, so don't expect much. But another person in the same position, finding this might lead to calmer days.</p>

In Northern cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, they found strength and security in a range of Muslim organizations, from the India-based Ahmadiyya movement to the homegrown Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam. In this film, host Malika Bilal (Senior Presenter, Al Jazeera English) tells the story of these early Black American Muslim communities through a woman named Florence Watts, who moved to the bustling South Side of Chicago around 1910, where she found work as a cook and a maid. 

Drawing on the work of Sylvia Chan-Malik, (author of Being Muslim: A Cultural History of Women of Color in American Islam,) Malika discovers how Florence was drawn to the teachings of the Ahmadiyya missionary, Mufti Mohammad Sadiq. In 1923, she joined one of the first multi-racial Muslim communities in the country. That same year, Florence was featured in the Ahmadiyya magazine Moslem Sunrise, her image captured in one of the earliest known photographs of a group of Muslim women taken in the United States. Through Florence‚Äôs story, Malika discovers how these Muslim groups helped working-class Black Americans resist the confines of race in the United States and feel part of a global community of believers. They in turn helped to create a legacy of Islam that has been embraced by African Americans since.

American Muslims: A History Revealed
A series of six short documentary films that reveal and explore the early history of Muslims in America. The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric. Actors reading the part of historical characters include Hiam Abbas, David Rasche, Kamal Khan, and Faarshad Farahat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The intestine - The body‚Äôs underappreciated control center and gut health | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zbqo_hrwXc</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2025 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The intestine is a true marvel. This organ‚Äôs complex functions extend far beyond the mere processing of food. The intestine affects the immune system and also has a powerful effect on our emotional well-being.

If a person‚Äôs gut is doing well, that person is doing well. If the gut is doing poorly, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation -- or depression. So, what can be done to protect and strengthen the gut?

This documentary follows people for whom the gut plays a special role in their lives. They speak openly about what is sometimes a taboo subject.

Jana Eberhart has a stressful everyday life. The student works as a model and is a passionate about sports. In fact, she‚Äôs about to take part in an Ironman competition. Can a change in diet strengthen her gut so that she can perform better? Sports and nutrition consultant Dr. Jens Freese accompanies Jana on her project over an extended period of time. What impact will dietary changes and other interventions have? 

For actor and fitness influencer Philipp Stehler, careful management of the gut is essential. He lives with ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal inflammation condition. This disease almost cost him his life. His large intestine had to be surgically removed. Philipp Stehler talks openly about his life then and now. While his diet used to consist mainly of meat and protein shakes, he now eats a vegan diet and practices yoga and meditation every day.

Carina Speck has been living with irritable bowel syndrome or IBS for 13 years. Bloating, diarrhea and stomach cramps accompany her in everything she does. But the social media manager doesn't want to isolate herself because of it. On Instagram and TikTok, she gives tips on things like traveling with IBS. Dr. Miriam Stengel from SRH Klinikum Sigmaringen guides her, with recommendations on how she can get a better handle on her symptoms.

<p>I am excited to announce the release of TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that delivers state-of-the-art predictions on small datasets in just 2.8 seconds for classification and 4.8 seconds for regression compared to strong baselines tuned for 4 hours. Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href="https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn">https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn</a>. You can also try it via API: <a href="https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client">https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client</a><p>TabPFN v2 is trained on 130 million synthetic tabular prediction datasets to perform in-context learning and output a predictive distribution for the test data points. Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn't been our focus.<p>We're actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!</p>

--

No substance has been as constant an ally to insidious scheming as arsenic, the so-called ‚Äúking of poisons.‚Äù In its chemically pure form, it isn‚Äôt much of a threat because our bodies don‚Äôt absorb it well; it‚Äôs when arsenic combines with other elements that things get dangerous. So, how did this substance become such a popular poison? Neil Bradbury digs into the element's sordid and lethal history.

<p>I realized that the PDF engines of modern desktop browsers (PDFium and PDF.js) support JavaScript with enough I/O primitives to make a basic game like Tetris.<p>It was a bit tricky to find a union of features that work in both engines, but in the end it turns out that showing/hiding annotation "fields" works well to make monochrome pixels, and keyboard input can be achieved by typing in a text input box.<p>All in all it's quite janky but a nice reminder of how general purpose PDF scripting can be. The linked PDF is all ASCII so you can just open it in a text editor, or have a look at the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/ThomasRinsma/pdftris/blob/main/gengrid.py">https://github.com/ThomasRinsma/pdftris/blob/main/gengrid.py</a></p>

I discuss how pain interpretation is a complex experience, shaped by both internal factors like emotions and genetics, as well as external factors, such as context. I explain how practical strategies like acupuncture, breathing techniques, exercise and temperature modulation can influence the body‚Äôs pain response and accelerate recovery. I also discuss topics like phantom limb pain, recovering from traumatic brain injury and the crucial role inflammation plays in the healing process. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

<p>Hey there, I'm a big fan of the game Factorio and the beauty of factories in the game. That's why I created a website to artfully visualize Factorio blueprints a few years ago. With the new 2.0 update, a few things broke. I took the opportunity to rewrite everything from Python to JavaScript and support Factorio 2.0 and the Space Age DLC. It's now also possible to easily modify the style of the drawings. Let me know if you find any bugs or if you have ideas for features.</p>

              <p>The people overseeing the security of Google‚Äôs Chrome browser <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/spam-and-abuse">explicitly forbid</a> third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a>. The policy specifically calls out search-manipulating techniques such as listing multiple extensions that provide the same experience or plastering extension descriptions with loosely related or unrelated keywords.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, security and privacy researcher Wladimir Palant revealed that developers are flagrantly violating those terms in hundreds of extensions currently available for download from Google. As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.</p>
<h2>Not looking? Don‚Äôt care? Both?</h2>
<p>A search Wednesday morning in California for Norton Password Manager, for example, returned not only the official extension but three others, all of which are unrelated at best and potentially abusive at worst. The results may look different for searches at other times or from different locations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/googles-chrome-web-store-has-a-serious-spam-problem-promoting-shady-extensions/">Read full article</a></p>

What sets ancient Rome apart is that many of these celebrities‚Äîparticularly gladiators, actors, and musicians‚Äîwere slaves, performing in public arenas to gain fame, sometimes even achieving wealth and freedom.

Explore how Roman emperors, such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, shaped not only the political landscape but also fashion trends and cultural movements. Hadrian, for instance, popularized wearing a beard, which became fashionable for a century after his reign. Roman gladiators, actresses, musicians, and authors, rose to prominence through their performances. Despite being from marginalized backgrounds, their talents made them stars, adored by the public.

<p>Hi HN! I‚Äôm Anirudh ‚Äî longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods ‚Äî act, extract, and observe. We‚Äôd love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart
</code></pre>
Here‚Äôs a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();
    await stagehand.init();

    // Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes
    const { page, context } = stagehand

    await page.goto("instadash.com") // Regular Playwright

    // Take action on the page
    await page.act({ action: "click on taqueria cazadores" })

    // Extract relevant data from the page
    const { price } = await page.extract({
        instruction: "extract the price of the super burrito",
        schema: z.object({
            price: z.number()
        })
    })

</code></pre>
We built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write
2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we‚Äôve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what‚Äôs rendered on the page. However, we didn‚Äôt want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href="https://docs.stagehand.dev" rel="nofollow">https://docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We‚Äôd love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href="https://stagehand.dev/slack" rel="nofollow">https://stagehand.dev/slack</a></p>

The best part is the accessories feature: <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/commands/accessory/" rel="nofollow">https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/commands/accessory/</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href="https://meilisearch.com" rel="nofollow">https://meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href="https://openobserve.ai" rel="nofollow">https://openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I‚Äôm hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href="https://replicate.com/nightmareai/real-esrgan">https://replicate.com/nightmareai/real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I've used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn‚Äôt compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here‚Äôs what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It‚Äôs an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn‚Äôt support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn‚Äôt enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue/Cache/Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It's like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.</p>

She was every bit a woman of her time, engaging in the overblown sentimentality and culture of death so pervasive during the age that bears her name. When she died at 81, the queen left secret, detailed instructions on how to handle her body and what items to place in her coffin. There are, indeed, a number of strange Queen Victoria death facts worth exploring.

<p>Hello HN! Sharing a recent side project of mine, the Atlas of Space, that I built out to explore the Solar System.<p>As a long-time space nerd, I realized recently that I didn't have a good intuition on the scale, speed, and relative orientation of the celestial bodies around us. So over the break I built out a kind of spatial Wikipedia to click around and learn about planets, moons, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun.<p>The physics is all simulated in the browser using simple Newtonian mechanics. There's a lot left to do from here, including modeling objects in non-Keplerian orbits and replaying different spacecraft missions.<p>Hope you have fun clicking around, and curious to hear what I should improve next!</p>

Analysis of the coffee consumption of more than 40,000 adults found that morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease during a 10-year follow-up period than those who went without. But the benefits to heart health appeared to vanish in people who drank coffee throughout the day, the researchers found, with medical records showing no significant reduction in mortality for all-day drinkers compared with those who avoided coffee. [...]
 
The study suggests that a morning dose of coffee is better for the heart than an evening one, but it does not explain why. One possible explanation is that drinking coffee later in the day can disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin. This in turn affects sleep, inflammation and blood pressure, all of which can harm heart health. In an accompanying editorial, Prof Thomas Luscher, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals in London, notes that many all-day drinkers sleep poorly, adding that coffee seems to suppress melatonin, a hormone that is important for inducing sleep in the brain. The effects are driven largely by caffeine, but coffee contains hundreds of other bioactive compounds that affect our physiology. The researchers say some substances in the blood that drive inflammation often peak in the morning and could be countered by anti-inflammatory compounds in a morning coffee. "This explanation applies to both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee," they write. "Overall, we must accept the now substantial evidence that coffee drinking, particularly in the morning hours, is likely to be healthy," Luscher writes. "Thus, drink your coffee, but do so in the morning!"
 
The study has been published in the European Heart Journal.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>Video game emulation is the process of using software to replicate the functionality of gaming hardware. It&#8217;s a fundamental approach to making older games accessible on modern devices.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>The Carbon Engine is a tool developed internally at video game publisher and distributor Limited Run Games. It allows a variety of emulators to interface with modern video game hardware, and it supports emulation of SNES, Genesis, PlayStation, Gameboy Advance, and other consoles.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><a href="https://x.com/modernvintageg">Dimitris Giannakis</a> is the Lead Developer of the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/pages/carbon-engine">Carbon Engine</a>. He is known for his many contributions in the hacking, emulation, and game development space, and for his highly popular YouTube channel, Modern Vintage Gamer, or MVG.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Dimitris joins the podcast with Joe Nash to talk how he got started in game development, building emulators from scratch, scoping an emulation project, homebrew vs. official SDKs, the Carbon Engine, and more.</div>

this is the universal hand signal for needing help.

The way you can remember it is It‚Äôs like someone being trapped.

It was originally established in 2020 for victims of domestic abuse, but it can obviously be used for other situations.

Now if you see this, you know what it means.

Also, if someone needs help and isn‚Äôt able to use words, it would be helpful for them to know this.

Please share this to get the word out.

And while doing so, innocent lives are also being taken - leaving the authorities deeply alarmed.

They fear that conditions are starting to mirror those in the neighboring Netherlands, where a high-profile investigative journalist was murdered by hired guns, and judges and prosecutors have received death threats. Nor do the gangs responsible shy from intimidating politicians and the royal family. Struggling to find attorneys willing to defend key witnesses, European authorities have had to recruit lawyers from abroad. In an organized crime business worth billions of euros, anyone who stands in the way runs the risk of being targeted by the cartels. This global war rages on in Europe and is increasingly stretching the German state to its limits. The makers of this film accompanied the country's interior minister and senior law enforcement officials on their visit to South America to expand international cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking. They also talked to criminal lawyers, toxicologists and police investigators in this ever escalating conflict. Are the cocaine wars winnable, or is it already too late?

              <p>On Monday, Nvidia announced <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/project-digits/">Project DIGITS</a>, a small desktop computer aimed at researchers, data scientists, and students who want to experiment with AI models‚Äîsuch as chatbots like ChatGPT and image generators‚Äîat home. The $3,000 device, which contains Nvidia's new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, debuted at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. It will launch in May and can operate as a standalone PC or connect to a Windows or Mac machine.</p>
<p>At CES on Monday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the new system as "a cloud computing platform that sits on your desk." The company also designed Project DIGITS as a bridge between desktop development and cloud deployment. Developers can create and test AI applications locally on Project DIGITS, then move them to cloud services or data centers that use similar Nvidia hardware.</p>
<p>The GB10 chip inside the Project DIGITS computer combines an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Nvidia Blackwell GPU</a> with a 20-core Grace CPU based on Arm architecture.

Very old-school. But optimized for more modern hardware. Very fast too.<p>Still not production ready, but it seems like it is mostly working.<p>I want to finish a few larger projects with it to see what happens.<p>Btw, the name is probably temporary.</p>

              <p>In 2012, an industry-wide coalition of hardware and software makers adopted Secure Boot to protect Windows devices against the threat of malware that could infect the BIOS and, later, its successor, the UEFI, the firmware that loaded the operating system each time a computer booted up.</p>
<p>Firmware-dwelling malware raises the specter of malware that infects the devices before the operating system even loads, each time they boot up. From there, it can remain immune to detection and removal. Secure Boot uses public-key cryptography to block the loading of any code that isn‚Äôt signed with a pre-approved digital signature.</p>
<h2>2018 calling for its BIOS</h2>
<p>Since 2016, Microsoft has required all Windows devices to include a strong, trusted platform module that enforces Secure Boot. To this day, organizations widely regard Secure Boot as an important, if not essential, foundation of trust in securing devices in some of the most critical environments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/widely-used-dna-sequencer-still-doesnt-enforce-secure-boot/">Read full article</a></p>

When it comes to musical dynasties, the Bach family is tough to beat, although today‚Äôs Kanneh-Mason clan is formidable. The Bachs included some 75 active musicians over a 200-year span, including superstar Johann Sebastian. The Kanneh-Mason household, from England, is just getting started, but boasts seven siblings, each classically trained, with a few having launched major careers, including the eldest, Isata, who brings three of her favorite pieces to our trusty Tiny Desk upright piano.

In her early years, Kanneh-Mason, like many budding pianists, practiced the easier works by Chopin. And, like visiting an old friend, she keeps returning to the so-called poet of the piano, but in this performance she plays the difficult and rambunctious finale to Chopin‚Äôs Third Piano Sonata. With cascades of chords, rippling arpeggios and romantic sweep, just getting to all of the notes is a major feat.

As a second course, Kanneh-Mason offers contrasting music by Franz Liszt, the ne plus ultra of Romantic era piano virtuosos, whose serene side gets the spotlight in the Consolation No. 3 ‚Äî dressed in diaphanous curlicues and lacy ornamentation.  

Kanneh-Mason closes with an arrangement of ‚ÄúSometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child‚Äù by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, a Black British composer who died young in 1912. Coleridge-Taylor holds a special place in the heart of Kanneh-Mason and her family because his father hailed from Sierra Leone, the birthplace of Kanneh-Mason‚Äôs mother.

‚ÄúGrowing up, I never really saw any Black composers within the classical music field,‚Äù Kanneh-Mason explains. Now, with her career rising, she‚Äôs extending their legacy.

Fr√©d√©ric Chopin: Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor - IV. Finale

A new year is a great time for a fresh start with money.

So, If you haven‚Äôt done so before, learn how to create a simple monthly budget so you can track what‚Äôs coming in and going out. 
As Dave Ramsey says ‚Äúa budget is telling your money where to go, instead of wondering where it went.‚Äù

Remember to pay yourself!
$20 a week is a thousand dollars a year!

If you keep putting this off it‚Äôs actually costing you money because you‚Äôre missing out on the power of compound interest!

Know the difference between needs and wants then try to cut unnecessary expenses from your budget. 

If you‚Äôre struggling to save $20 a week
Even $10 a week is $500 a year!

Review your budget every month, and adjust as needed.

Be kind to yourself, and don‚Äôt give up if it‚Äôs not perfect, 
it takes time to form new habits. ü§ó

Your future self thanks you! ü´Ç

I hope you have a great year!

God bless you! üôèüèª

              <p>On Sunday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered two eye-catching predictions about the near-future of artificial intelligence. In a post titled "Reflections" on his personal blog, Altman <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections">wrote</a>, "We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it." He added, "We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies."</p>
<p>Both statements are notable coming from Altman, who has served as the leader of OpenAI during the rise of mainstream generative AI products such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. AI agents are the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">latest marketing trend</a> in AI, allowing AI models to take action on a user's behalf. However, critics of the company and Altman immediately took aim at the statements on social media.</p>
<p>"<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">We are now confident that we can spin bullshit at unprecedented levels, and get away with it," <a href="https://x.com/GaryMarcus/status/1876098456022106266">wrote</a>¬†frequent OpenAI critic Gary Marcus in response to Altman's post. "So we now aspire to aim beyond that, to hype in purest sense of that word. We love our products, but we are here for the glorious next rounds of funding. With infinite funding, we can control the universe."</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/sam-altman-says-we-are-now-confident-we-know-how-to-build-agi/">Read full article</a></p>

He's been fighting improbable odds to find a partner willing to share a hard life on the farm. Is it even possible?

Peter Tillmann has quite a challenge on his hands. This 29-year-old daily farmer and his father run a spread with some 200 animals. It's a lot of work, but Peter formally trained as an agriculturalist, and as the fifth generation in his family to raise cattle, he's continuing a long tradition. He just hopes he won't be the last. An essential part of that plan is to find a partner and have children someday. This is a glimpse into the life, cares and woes of the typical German farmer. A report by Miodrag Soric.

Of the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants, all have been charged with some form of trespassing or disorderly conduct and more than a third have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Some, like Joseph Biggs, a leader of the Proud Boys, are already lobbying for pardons.

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll focus on the challenges of building retrieval augmented generation (RAG) chat applications and how to overcome them efficiently. We'll explore common issues such as file processing, semantic search, and prompt iteration, showing how Elasticsearch helps streamline these tasks. Using Elastic Playground, we'll fine-tune settings and quickly test RAG prompts to optimize performance.

I'll also walk through the process of transforming files into sparse vector embeddings for better search results, and demonstrate how to seamlessly export code for integration into a functional chat application. [...]

I explain how many of the positive effects of exercise on brain function occur through the action of specific neurochemicals that increase alertness.

I also cover how to best time exercise and which specific types of exercise to include in your weekly routine to maximize benefits for your brain. Additionally, I explain how certain types of exercise trigger the release of a hormone from your bones called osteocalcin, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.

The positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.

Suraya Mohamed | January 5, 2025
NMIXX is not just another South Korean girl group. These talented ladies are accomplished singers who performed this 26 minute set in one take and without sound reinforcement wedges that musicians traditionally use to hear themselves better. It‚Äôs not easy for any group, especially one with six vocalists, to move out of their comfort zone of a traditional recording environment, but NMIXX fully embraced the Tiny Desk ethos. Using the natural room acoustics to hear themselves and the band, the singers‚Äô intonation and vocal execution was superb as they sang arrangements carefully prepared for this special setting.

‚ÄúThis is exciting,‚Äù said leader and main vocalist HAEWON. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our first time singing without in-ear monitors. We can feel the vibe of this place.‚Äù That feeling was evident not only in the authenticity and spontaneity of the music, but also during the banter in between the songs. Unchoreographed and casual, they laughed as they tried to figure out if one of the toy instruments was a glockenspiel or a xylophone.

This dynamic five song set includes a mix of genre influences like pop, old school hip-hop and country styles, and ends with two new songs, ‚ÄúSee that?‚Äù and ‚ÄúLove Is Lonely‚Äù from their latest EP, Fe304:STICK OUT released last August.

He makes the case for Northeastern to reconsider its decision to move from Racket to Python and Java later this year in an overhaul of its first-year curriculum. 

"Students will get extensive training in Python, which is currently the most requested language by co-op employers," Northeastern explains (some two decades after a Slashdot commenter made the same Hot Languages = Jobs observation in a spirited 2001 debate on Java as a CS introductory language)... 

"I have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a 'useful language' like Python," Kaplan writes. "But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket &mdash; it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends." Also expressing concerns about the selection of suitable languages for novice programming is King's College CS Prof Michael K&#246;lling, who explains, "One of the drivers is the perceived usefulness of the language in a real-world context. Students (and their parents) often have opinions which language is 'better' to learn. In forming these opinions, the definition of 'better' can often be vague and driven by limited insight. One strong aspect commonly cited is the perceived usefulness of a language in the 'real world.' If a language is widely used in industry, it is more likely to be seen as a useful language to learn." K&#246;lling's recommendation? "We need a new language for teaching novices at secondary school and introductory university level," K&#246;lling concludes. "This language should be designed explicitly for teaching [...] Maintenance and adaptation of this language should be driven by pedagogical considerations, not by industry needs." While noble in intent, one suspects Kaplan and K&#246;lling may be on a quixotic quest in a money wins world, outgunned by the demands, resources, and influence of tech giants like Amazon &mdash; the top employer of Northeastern MSCS program grads &mdash; who pushed back against NSF advice to deemphasize Java in high school CS and dropped $15 million to have tech-backed nonprofit Code.org develop and push a new Java-based, powered-by-AWS CS curriculum into high schools with the support of a consortium of politicians, educators, and tech companies. Echoing Northeastern, an Amazon press release argued the new Java-based curriculum "best prepares students for the next step in their education and careers."

He treads the line between people who are deaf, and those who can hear. When he was 15 years old, he fell ill with a rare form of meningitis. He lost his hearing from one day to the next.

A shock for the teenager - and for his parents, too. Thanks to the modern technology of cochlear implants and a lot of training, he can now lead an almost unrestricted life again, as a family man. But everyday life remains exhausting. Now, he campaigns for people who find themselves in situations similar to his own.

 In November the Steam Survey reflected a 2.03% marketshare for Linux... Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. 

 In fact, December "saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey," according to TechSpot &mdash; "up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%..."
Elsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.
Rounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... 

Phoronix adds that the Windows percent "pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Soundwaves: The Symphony of Physics 
Sound is one of the most vivid ways we interact with the underlying science of the universe. A sound can make us laugh, cry or cower in fear, but it can also help us understand our world, how it works and what it's made of. Sound is something we all take for granted, but, in fact, when you hear something you're listening to the sound of pure physics. In this engrossing two-part series Helen Czerski goes on a spectacular journey into the world of sound to discover what it is and what it reveals about the fundamental forces of nature.

But little attention is paid to it by the media and the international community. Estimates put the number of victims in the millions, with no end in sight.

All parties in the conflict seem to be trapped in a spiral of violence. The disputes are over power, money and access to the country‚Äôs valuable natural resources.

Belgian film director Thierry Michel has been travelling throughout the Congo with his camera for over 30 years. He has witnessed the struggles and suffering, but also the hopes of the Congolese people. In the film, the speech by doctor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege outlines the story of the relentless violence that has devastated and destroyed the Congo for so long.

None of the actors in this drama are spared in this uncompromising film - from Congolese rulers, to neighboring countries, to international institutions. The film draws on the UN Mapping Report, which records the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003. The report names the perpetrators, which caused unease and was kept secret.

The film paints a contrasting picture of a country caught between outrage and solidarity. It speaks out in favor of coming to terms with history, and against forgetting. The film aims to play a role in setting the record straight. After decades of impunity, the film shows, those responsible for crimes must be brought to justice.

Using techniques developed over 2,500 years ago, the team takes on the ultimate challenge of recreating a sarcophagus. Can modern hands replicate ancient ingenuity?

Taken from 'Building the Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

ABSTRACT
There is a paradox in the foundations of computing. On the one hand, lambda calculus is supposed to compute anything that can be computed. On the other hand, many intensional computations, such as deciding equality of programs (terms in closed normal form), are not definable within lambda calculus. The paradox has now been resolved by close reading of the original papers and books, which clarifies that lambda calculus is inherently extensional.

More importantly, there are new, intensional calculi which are more expressive than lambda calculus. First, pattern calculus supports both higher-order functions and generic queries of data structures, by basing all computation on pattern matching. Second, SF-calculus can query programs as well as data structures by factoring them, using the operator F. In particular, the Goedel number of a program can be defined within the calculus itself.Third, lambda-SF calculus adds native support for lambda-abstraction to SF-calculus. Other calculi are currently under development.

Pattern calculus has been realised in the programming language, bondi. Even better programming languages are now possible.

// Abstract
Lloyds Banking Group is on a mission to embrace the power of cloud and unlock the opportunities that it provides. Andrew, Michelle, and their MLOps team have been on a journey over the last 12 months to take their portfolio of circa 10 Machine Learning models in production and migrate them from an on-prem solution to a cloud-based environment. During the podcast, Michelle and Andrew share their reflections as well as some dos (and don‚Äôts!) of managing the migration of an established portfolio.

// Bio
Michelle Marie Conway
Michelle is a Lead Data Scientist in the high-performance data science team at Lloyds Banking Group. With deep expertise in managing production-level Python code and machine learning models, she has worked alongside fellow senior manager Andrew to drive the bank's transition to the Google Cloud Platform. Together, they have played a pivotal role in modernising the ML portfolio in collaboration with a remarkable ML Ops team.

Originally from Ireland and now based in London, Michelle blends her technical expertise with a love for the arts. 

Andrew Baker
Andrew graduated from the University of Birmingham with a first-class honours degree in Mathematics and Music with a Year in Computer Science and joined Lloyds Banking Group on their Retail graduate scheme in 2015.

Since 2021 Andrew has worked in the world of data, firstly in shaping the Retail data strategy and most recently as a Data Science Delivery Lead, growing and managing a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. He has built a high-performing team responsible for building and maintaining ML models in production for the Consumer Lending division of the bank.

Andrew is motivated by the role that data science and ML can play in transforming the business and its processes, and is focused on balancing the power of ML with the need for simplicity and explainability that enables business users to engage with the opportunities that exist in this space and the demands of a highly regulated environment.

They consist mainly of deciduous trees. One tree has a very special role to play: the oak.

For the Celts, the oak symbolised the connection between the spirits of heaven and earth. In fact, the tree is perfectly adapted to the changing seasons: In autumn it loses its leaves, in winter it rests under a blanket of snow and in spring it begins to sprout anew. Its fruits are a tasty treat for wood mice, wild boar, squirrels and jays, all of which help to spread the oak seeds. High in the branches, green woodpeckers and bats thank the tree for its hospitality by ridding it of the parasites that prey on its wood and leaves.

The shy lynx also serves the oak well, defending it from the deer and ibex that love to nibble on its shoots. Beneath the ground, the oak lives in symbiosis with fungi, which provide it with vital nutrients. Ecologists, biologists and fungal researchers explain the connections between these fascinating interactions. The secret of the success of the highly resilient temperate forests lies in their biodiversity. Unfortunately, they are increasingly being replaced by pure conifer plantations, which meet the demands of the highly standardized timber industry but deplete the soil, causing numerous species to migrate. In view of industrial timber construction practices and the expansion of urban centers, the question arises: is the oak really as immortal as people claim?

The technique, detailed in a new paper, requires programmers to use a restricted version of C called "Mini-C" that excludes features like pointer arithmetic. The researchers successfully tested their conversion system on two major code libraries, including the 80,000-line HACL* cryptographic library. Parts of the converted code have already been integrated into Mozilla's NSS and OpenSSH security systems, according to the researchers. Memory safety errors account for 76% of Android vulnerabilities in 2019.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Amid this flurry of chaos, there exists an age-old profession - midwifery. You‚Äôd think helping parents bring their children into this world would be considered a noble pursuit. But being a midwife has never been simple. They were lauded as heroes in one century, persecuted as witches in the next, and are still given the occasional side-eye today.

But this time a narrower majority and a hollowed-out center might mean the Trumpiest Congress ever might fail to deliver his agenda. Republicans and Democrats have each retreated more into their own camps, making the possibility for dealmaking even more narrow. 

WSJ explores why Trump may have a difficult time getting funding for his different policies like his immigration and deportation plans and his tax cuts.

ABSTRACT
Consulting group McKinsey & Company have recently published an article called ‚ÄúYes you can measure software developer productivity‚Äù which has been widely criticised. Grady Booth said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rubbish‚Äù, Kent Back said ‚ÄúThe report is so absurd and naive that it makes no sense to critique it in detail‚Äù and Daniel Terhorst-North said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to measure the individual contribution of a unit in a complex adaptive system, because the premise of the question is flawed‚Äù.

In this episode software engineer and author, Dave Farley joins in with the critique, and while agreeing with Kent Beck on most things, does look at the report in some detail to critique it. He finds that the McKinsey developer productivity article is as useless and ill-informed as the reactions of many other industry experts would suggest.

              <p>As many of us celebrated the year-end holidays, a small group of researchers worked overtime tracking a startling discovery: At least 33 browser extensions hosted in Google‚Äôs Chrome Web Store, some for as long as 18 months, were surreptitiously siphoning sensitive data from roughly 2.6 million devices.</p>
<p>The compromises came to light with the <a href="https://www.vulnu.com/p/breaking-cyberhaven-chrome-extension-compromised">discovery</a> by data loss prevention service Cyberhaven that a Chrome extension used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227171802/https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cyberhaven-security-exten/pajkjnmeojmbapicmbpliphjmcekeaac">400,000</a> of its customers had been updated with code that stole their sensitive data.</p>
<h2>‚ÄôTwas the night before Christmas</h2>
<p>The malicious extension, available as version 24.10.4, was available for 31 hours, from December 25 at 1:32 AM UTC to Dec 26 at 2:50 AM UTC.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law and Diana Montalion explore the critical importance of systems thinking in software development and organizational dynamics. Diana Montalion touches on her new book, "Learning Systems Thinking," highlighting how traditional linear approaches to problem-solving often fall short in today's complex environments. She emphasizes that effective systems leadership requires not only recognizing the interconnectedness of various components but also fostering collaborative thinking and decision-making among teams.

By engaging in practices that enhance understanding and adaptability, organizations can better navigate challenges and drive meaningful change, moving beyond simplistic solutions to embrace a more holistic view of their systems.

Now it faces a new threat: tens of millions of mostly young workers who refuse to pay into it.

Humphrey, a 24-year-old tango instructor, and Gao Peng Cheng, a 22-year-old content creator, are among them. They say they‚Äôre pessimistic about China‚Äôs economic future and that their money could be put to better use. 

Yet, China‚Äôs pension system needs that money. More than 20 million Chinese are expected to retire each year over the next decade. And most will be eligible to receive some sort of retirement benefit. 

It‚Äôs part of the reason why, on Jan. 1, President Xi Jinping‚Äôs government officially raised the country‚Äôs retirement age for the first time in more than 40 years.

As always he is joined by Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson who talks him through the history of all the pistols, rifles and machine guns employed in the conflict.

First up is the Webley Revolver Mk VI, first introduced during the stalemate of static and bloody trench warfare in 1915. Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley‚Äôs returning to front line service in the conflict.

Second is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.

Third up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.

Last but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren‚Äôs box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition.

Born in suburban Waterloo, Iowa, Mike‚Äôs parents instilled a solid foundation of integrity, compassion, and hard work that carried him through his teen years into one of the most pivotal decisions of his life. After graduation, without a second thought, Mike decided he wanted to serve his country as a Navy SEAL.

--

For years, Jean B√©liveau walked from country to country, with the goal of circumnavigating the globe on foot. While few people have the time or desire to walk such extreme lengths, research shows that adding even a modest amount of walking to your daily routine can dramatically improve your health. So, what exactly happens to your body when you increase your step count? Shannon Odell investigates.

Nearly 13 million tourists went on Caribbean cruises in 2013, but there are only so many ports they can visit. Because of increasingly large crowds in places like Nassau, new destinations like Ocean Cay in the Bahamas have become increasingly important. 

WSJ explores how MSC spent $500 million transforming a dredging site into an exclusive destination for its passengers.

I outline tools to improve focus and learning, including when to use specific techniques based on the time of day and how to adjust focus and tasks according to energy levels. I also discuss the two essential components of creativity and explain how to structure productive, creative work sessions. By combining biological tools ‚Äî such as exercise, meals, hydration, and sleep ‚Äî with subjective methods like music, I demonstrate how to tailor your approach to align with your unique biological rhythms and individual goals, fostering greater creativity and learning.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes, approximately 30 minutes, focused on key scientific and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials are released every Thursday, while full-length episodes continue to be released every Monday.

<p>Teardown is a 2022 sandbox puzzle game developed and published by Tuxedo Labs. The game revolves around the owner of a financially stricken demolition company, who is caught undertaking a questionable job and becomes entangled between helping police investigations and taking on further dubious assignments.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>The game stands out for its technical achievements, particularly its use of voxel-based rendering, which enables highly interactive and fully destructible environments. <a href="https://x.com/voxagonlabs">Dennis Gustafsson</a> is the Founder of <a href="https://tuxedolabs.com/">TuxedoLabs</a> and the creator of Teardown, among other games. In today&#8217;s episode, Dennis speaks with Joe Nash about his 20-year history in game development, his passion for physics in games, Teardown, the advantage of using voxels, and much more.</p>

Happy New Year! üôåüèª

I always love a new year because it‚Äôs another 
chance to make a fresh start! ‚òÄÔ∏è

So, I thought I would share a simple formula to 
help set some goals for yourself.

First, Know where you are at currently.
If you want to get in shape, or lose weight, 
you will need to take an honest look at where you are.
If you want to get out of debt, or have financial goals, again you will need to take a hard look at your current situation.

Second, Know where you want to go.
What are you hoping to achieve?

Third, Make a plan to get there.
For financial goals, that would be a budget.
Don‚Äôt overthink it. It doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect, 
you can adjust it as you go.

I personally would recommend keeping your goals to yourself, or maybe just you and your partner, and write them down!

Remember, A goal is just a dream until it‚Äôs written down.

I hope you have a great year!

God bless you!

Watson, a renowned psychologist, and Rosalie Rayner, his assistant and eventual wife, decided to combine love, science, and a fair bit of cluelessness in an experiment that would go down in history as ‚ÄúThe Little Albert Experiment.‚Äù The idea was bold, the execution debatable, and the results as ethically murky as a midsummer mud puddle. Thus, in a story one might mistake for the beginning of a Dickensian epic, Little Albert‚Äôs fate was sealed.

With Windows 10 reaching end of support in October 2025, many users will face decisions about upgrading hardware for Windows 11 or considering different operating systems entirely. Linux distributions have evolved to offer increasingly polished desktop experiences, with improving hardware compatibility and familiar user interfaces. 

2024 saw Linux adoption grow thanks to the Steam Deck's success, reaching a 4.04% market share in December, up from 3.85% during the same time last year. More Linux laptops, improved gaming compatibility, and growing awareness of its benefits also contributed to its steady rise.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

We discuss the psychology and neuroscience of human drives, sustaining motivation, choosing a direction and vision for one‚Äôs life, and the guideposts within philosophy, culture, and religion that can help us select and navigate the best possible path.

It‚Äôs a serious discussion that includes deep dives into topics such as addiction, relationships, politics, and how we need to organize our internal and external lives to become the best versions of ourselves‚Äîfor the sake of our own happiness and to better serve others.

Here, Jordan refers to the immensely powerful results that come from simply organizing one‚Äôs physical space and the ramifications it has on our internal landscape. He explains how this can cascade to positively impact our thinking, emotions, and behavior.

Our conversation is grounded in research data and practical tools that people of all ages and genders should find useful.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over 3.1 Million Fake &apos;Stars&apos; on GitHub Projects Used To Boost Rankings</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/31/1726239/over-31-million-fake-stars-on-github-projects-used-to-boost-rankings?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:27:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers have uncovered widespread manipulation of GitHub's star-rating system, with over 3.1 million fraudulent stars identified across 15,835 repositories, according to a new study by Socket, Carnegie Mellon University, and North Carolina State University. 

The research team analyzed 20TB of data from GHArchive, spanning 6 billion GitHub events from 2019 to 2024, using their "StarScout" detection tool. The tool identified 278,000 accounts engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior to artificially boost repository rankings. 

GitHub uses stars, similar to social media likes, to rank projects and recommend content to users. The platform has previously encountered malicious exploitation of this system, including the "Stargazers Ghost Network" malware operation discovered last summer. Approximately 91% of flagged repositories and 62% of suspicious accounts were removed by October 2024.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making‚Äîfor better or worse‚Äîand how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life. 

We also explore the innate human drive to create "impact at a distance" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time. 

Listeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.

              <p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys‚Äîthe much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years‚Äîwas supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts.

‚ÄúRadical self-love‚Äù ‚Äî what it is and how to do it.

It is incredibly common for many of us humans, whatever our gender, to be at war with our bodies -- trying to live up to the people we see in the movies, on social media, or even the versions of ourselves in old pictures. This never-enough-ness can lead to an ambient level of self-loathing that can be incredibly destructive. That's where "radical self-love" comes in.

Our guest today is Sonya Renee Taylor. She is the author of three books, including The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love. She is the Founder and Radical Executive Officer of The Body is Not An Apology. She has come to this work as a result of her own personal pain, as a Black woman inhabiting a body that she says does not conform to societal norms. 

In this conversation, we talk about defining radical self-love (and why she believes it's our natural state), tools for cultivating radical self-love, and the connection between being OK with yourself and the larger society.

Started in 1984 (and inspired partly by a bug in the classic Bourne shell), it's "the Internet's oldest contest," acording to their official social media account on Mastodon. 

The contest enters its "pending" state today at 2024-12-29 23:58 UTC &mdash; meaning an opening date for submissions has been officially scheduled (for January 31st) as well as a closing date roughly eight weeks later on April 1st, 2025. That's according to the newly-released (proposed and tentative) rules and guidelines, listing contest goals like "show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way" and "stress C compilers with unusual code." And the contest's home page adds an additional goal: "to have fun with C!" 

Excerpts from the official rules:


Rule 0 
Just as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) 

Rule 1 
Your submission must be a complete program.... 

Rule 5 
Your submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... 


Rule 6 
I am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); 
 while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {
 ha_ha_ha();
 } 

 
Rule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:
 You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. 

There are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... 


We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.
 

And this weekend there was also a second announcement:

After a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries. A number of fixes and improvements involve the ability of reasonable modern Unix/Linux systems to be able to compile and even run them.

The latest version of the language pushes the envelope further for speed and power, sheds many of Python's most decrepit elements, and broadens its appeal with developers worldwide. Here's a look back at the year in Python. 

In the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or "GIL," a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue &mdash; enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. 

The no-GIL or "free-threaded" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. 
Another forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!

Is humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?

Next, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity‚Äôs urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. What happens to a photon‚Äôs energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe‚Äôs edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck‚Äôs constant would do to the universe. 

Was human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity‚Äôs ultimate motivator?

Could alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made "Matrix"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?

Finally, we explore humanity‚Äôs potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their "Matrix"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?

Taken from 'City in the Sky' (2016)
At any one time, there are a million people flying above our heads. But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century. And with air-passenger numbers predicted to double in the next 20 years, it also looks at what the industry will have to do to keep up.

Soldiers served for 25 years, and upon retirement, they were often granted land in far-flung parts of the empire. The life of a soldier was demanding, involving military training, campaigns, and marching across the empire, equipped with weapons like the Pilum, Gladius, and Scutum, along with protective armor like the Lorica Segmentata.

But live television, usually reserved for news, sporting events, and a single Saturday night-airing sketch comedy show, retains its capacity to capture true-life drama as it unfolds in real time. And those images become unforgettable moments in modern history.

2024 saw over 60 elections worldwide, many of which were marked with controversy. It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. 

Despite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. 

2024 had much of the world voting for change. Onward, to 2025 where we will find out what it means.

Correction: At 4:16 we show the wrong clip of Pope Francis. Our clip shows him visiting Myanmar in 2017 ‚Äî we meant to include a clip from his 2024 visit to Indonesia.

One cost estimate has his plan at $315 billion ‚Äì that‚Äôs more than the government spends on most federal agencies. Roughly 13 million immigrants who entered the country illegally are at risk of deportation.

WSJ breaks down the logistics and explains why an operation of this scale could require hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of a decade.

I explain how making errors triggers the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, which are essential for learning. I also discuss the differences between how neuroplasticity occurs in children and adults, focusing on the varying requirements and effort needed for learning. I discuss science-supported learning strategies for adults, including small practice bouts, leveraging frustration, regulating your autonomic state, and using movement to maximize focus and neuroplasticity. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

              <p>It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.</p>
<p>Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/">Transformer-based</a> AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">launched in June</a> held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">NotebookLM</a> also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">music synthesis models</a> and also better <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/">AI video generators</a>, including several from China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">Read full article</a></p>

Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? 

If generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? 

If a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend?

Sometimes we establish something as a historical ‚Äúfirst‚Äù or historical ‚Äúlast.‚Äù Other times, we label people, places, or periods as the ‚Äúworst‚Äù because, well, they‚Äôre kind of awful. But finding the ‚Äúmost‚Äù of something can also put history into perspective - strange world records right out of the Guinness book that offer surprising insight into the past. Some of these ‚Äúmosts‚Äù are genuine testaments to human strength, endurance, creativity, and spirit, while others, are not so much.

Are alien spacecraft here on Earth? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice discuss the UAP hearings, unexplained cosmic phenomena, dark matter, and more with astrophysicist and NASA UAP chair David Spergel.

David reveals what it‚Äôs like to investigate UFOs scientifically, explaining why most sightings turn out to be lens flares or misidentified objects‚Äî but also why the 1% of unexplained events still intrigue researchers. Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.

Switching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy. Learn how groundbreaking tools like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and collaborations with ESA‚Äôs Euclid mission aim to answer fundamental questions about the universe.  We discuss computational astrophysics and the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. From UFOs to cutting-edge astrophysics, this episode offers a clear-eyed look at the mysteries of the universe.

<p>Holistic Evaluation of Generative AI Systems // MLOps Podcast #280 with Jineet Doshi, Staff AI Scientist or AI Lead at Intuit.

// Abstract
Evaluating LLMs is essential in establishing trust before deploying them to production. Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.

              <p>Health care company Ascension lost sensitive data for nearly 5.6 million individuals in a cyberattack that was attributed to a notorious ransomware gang, according to documents filed with the attorney general of Maine.</p>
<p>Ascension owns 140 hospitals and scores of assisted living facilities. In May, the organization was hit with an attack that caused <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/19/nx-s1-5010219/ascension-hospital-ransomware-attack-care-lapses">mass disruptions</a> as staff was <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event">forced</a> to move to manual processes that caused errors, delayed or lost lab results, and diversions of ambulances to other hospitals. Ascension managed to restore most services by mid-June. At the time, the company said the attackers had stolen protected health information and personally identifiable information for an undisclosed number of people.</p>
<h2>Investigation concluded</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/e55264f2-ff87-4b28-874d-653cfb735fe6.html">filing</a> Ascension made earlier in December revealed that nearly 5.6 million people were affected by the breach. Data stolen depended on the particular person but included individuals' names and medical information (e.g., medical record numbers, dates of service, types of lab tests, or procedure codes), payment information (e.g., credit card information or bank account numbers), insurance information (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare ID, policy number, or insurance claim), government<br>

Seamless passenger flow reduces confusion, makes airports more money and helps prevent delays. But how can check-in, going through security and dealing with TSA and terminal configuration be best optimized?

WSJ asked an architect to break down how airports can be built to better manage crowds.

We discuss what truly increases happiness, examining factors such as money, social comparison, free time, alone time versus time spent with others, pets, and the surprising positive impact of negative visualizations. We also explore common myths and truths about introverts and extroverts, the science of motivation, and how to adjust your hedonic set point to experience significantly more joy in daily life. Throughout the episode, Dr. Santos shares science-supported strategies for enhancing emotional well-being and cultivating a deeper sense of meaning and happiness.

The Herculaneum papyri are carbonized scrolls from the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum. Reading the fragile scrolls requires multiple scientific steps that starts with a modeling process to transport them in cases that match their exact shape. Next, the scrolls are subjected to an extremely high-resolution X-ray with a photon beam. Can these scientists do what seems impossible? Reading the inside of an ancient scroll without opening it?

Taken from 'Building The Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

Capping off one wild and crazy decade, and on the cusp of an equally wild decade, 2009 had many moments! From the official swearing in of Barack Obama, the death of Pop Icon Michael Jackson, popular TV shows such as Glee getting their start, and a bit of drama with Taylor Swift and Kanye at the 2009 MTV Music awards, there's something for everyone! But, it wasn't all that bad, there was even a 'Miracle on the Hudson', when Captain Sullenberger landed a plane on the Hudson river and saved everyone onboard! 

Join us to see all that was weird and downright incredible in the year 2009!  What was a memory of yours from 2009? Let us know in the comments!

The T2 Linux team has unveiled T2 Linux SDE 24.12, codenamed "Sky's the Limit!", delivering a massive update for this highly portable source-based Linux distribution... With 3,280 package updates, 206 new features, and the ability to boot on systems with as little as 512MB RAM, this release further strengthens T2 Linux's position as the ultimate tool for developers working across diverse hardware and embedded systems.
 
Some highlights from Rene's announcement:

 "The release includes 37 pre-compiled ISOs with Glibc, Musl, and uClibc, supporting 25 CPU architectures like ARM(64), RISCV(64), Loongarch64, SPARC(64), and vintage retro computing platforms such as M68k, Alpha, and even initial Nintendo Wii U support added."
" The Cosmic Desktop, a modern Rust-based environment, debuts alongside expanded application support for non-mainstream RISC architectures, now featuring LibreOffice, OpenJDK, and QEMU."

And T2sde.org gives this glimpse of the future: 

"While initially created for the Linux kernel, T2 already has proof-of-concept support for building 'home-brew' pkg for Other OS, including: BSDs, macOS and Haiku. Work on alternative micro kernels, such as L4, Fuchsia, RedoxOS or integrating building 'AOSP' Android is being worked on as well."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Milan, 1494: Leonardo da Vinci was an exceptional man, and everyone who met him described him as a genius. And yet, he was now 42 years old ‚Äì a middle-aged man in an era when life expectancy was 40 - And he still hadn‚Äôt produced anything that would be considered a masterpiece by his contemporaries. Many of his works were unfinished or in private collections, there were no great public works that people could see, no architectural marvels and no distinguished altarpieces for cathedrals.
Nothing that could be considered worthy of his potential. 

Then, he was asked to paint a wall.

They almost always have masses many millions of times that of the sun, while the biggest grow to tens of billions. Exactly what was responsible for seeding these great engines, and building up their immense sizes, is a challenge only the James Webb Telescope can rise to. 

The concept of ‚ÄúEngine Black Holes‚Äù came from a book I read as an 12 year old, which talked about the Direct Collapse model. I don‚Äôt know what book it was or what happened to it, but I intended to bring it to life in this video. Merry Christmas! And many happy returns in 2024.

Microsoft-owned GitHub announced on Wednesday a free version of its popular Copilot code completion/AI pair programming tool, which will also now ship by default with Microsoft's popular VS Code editor. Until now, most developers had to pay a monthly fee, starting at $10 per month, with only verified students, teachers, and open source maintainers getting free access... 


There are some limitations to the free version, which is geared toward occasional users, not major work on a big project. Developers on the free plan will get access to 2,000 code completions per month, for example, and as a GitHub spokesperson told me, each Copilot code suggestion will count against this limit &mdash; not just accepted suggestions. And while GitHub recently added the ability to switch between different foundation models, users on the free plan are limited to Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o. (The paid plans also include Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and OpenAI's o1-preview and -mini.) For Copilot Chat, the number of chat messages is limited to 50, but otherwise, there aren't any major limitations to the free service. Developers still get access to all Copilot Extensions and skills. 

The free Copilot SKU will work in a number of editors, including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains, as well as on GitHub.com. 

GitHub's announcement ends with the words "Happy coding!" and calls the service "GitHub Copilot Free." But TechCrunch points out there's already competition from services like Amazon Q Developer, as well as from companies like Tabnine and Qodo (previously known as Codium) &mdash; and they typically offer a free tier. But in addition, "With Copilot Free, we are returning to our freemium roots," GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told TechCrunch, as well as "laying the groundwork for something far greater: AI represents our best path to enabling a GitHub with one billion developers. 

"There should be no barrier to entry for experiencing the joy of creating software. Now six years after being acquired by Microsoft, it indeed appears GitHub is still GitHub &mdash; and we are doing our thing." 

Or, as GitHub CEO Satya Nadella said in a video posted on LinkedIn, "The joy of coding is back! And we are looking forward to bringing the same experience to so many more people around the world."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

              <p>Over the past 12 business days, OpenAI has announced a new product or demoed an AI feature every weekday, calling the PR event "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>." We've covered some of the major announcements, but we thought a look at each announcement might be useful for people seeking a comprehensive look at each day's developments.</p>
<p>The timing and rapid pace of these announcements‚Äîparticularly in light of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-and-openai-blitz-december-with-so-many-ai-releases-its-hard-to-keep-up/">Google's competing releases</a>‚Äîillustrates the intensifying competition in AI development. What might normally have been spread across months was compressed into just 12 business days, giving users and developers a lot to process as they head into 2025.</p>
<p>Humorously, we asked ChatGPT what it thought about the whole series of announcements, and it was skeptical that the event even took place. "The rapid-fire announcements over 12 days seem plausible," wrote ChatGPT-4o, "But might strain credibility without a clearer explanation of how OpenAI managed such an intense release schedule, especially given the complexity of the features."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/12-days-of-openai-the-ars-technica-recap/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>On Friday, during Day 12 of its "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced its latest AI "reasoning" models, o3 and o3-mini, which build upon the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1 models</a> launched earlier this year. The company is not releasing them yet but will make these models available for public safety testing and research access today.</p>
<p>The models use what OpenAI calls "private chain of thought," where the model pauses to examine its internal dialog and plan ahead before responding, which you might call "simulated reasoning" (SR)‚Äîa form of AI that goes beyond basic large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>The company named the model family "o3" instead of "o2" to avoid potential trademark conflicts with British telecom provider O2, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-preps-o3-reasoning-model">The Information</a>. During Friday's livestream, Altman acknowledged his company's naming foibles, saying, "In the grand tradition of OpenAI being really, truly bad at names, it'll be called o3."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">Read full article</a></p>

Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.

// Abstract
Indexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.

The latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. 

We discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.

We conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.

              <p>Over the past month, we've seen a rapid cadence of notable AI-related announcements and releases from both Google and OpenAI, and it's been making the AI community's head spin. It has also poured fuel on the fire of the OpenAI-Google rivalry, an accelerating game of one-upmanship taking place unusually close to the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>"How are people surviving with the firehose of AI updates that are coming out," <a href="https://x.com/BowTiedFox/status/1867673263846969607">wrote</a> one user on X last Friday, which is still a hotbed of AI-related conversation. "in the last &lt;24 hours we got gemini flash 2.0 and chatGPT with screenshare, deep research, pika 2, sora, chatGPT projects, anthropic clio, wtf it never ends."</p>
<p>Rumors travel quickly in the AI world, and people in the AI industry had been expecting OpenAI to ship some major products in December. Once OpenAI announced "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>" earlier this month, Google jumped into gear and seemingly decided to try to one-up its rival on several counts. So far, the strategy appears to be working, but it's coming at the cost of the rest of the world being able to absorb the implications of the new releases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-and-openai-blitz-december-with-so-many-ai-releases-its-hard-to-keep-up/">Read full article</a></p>

When filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn‚Äôt as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and ‚Äî perhaps most importantly ‚Äî one that fits their budget. 

All these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the the flexible landscapes and tax breaks.

              <p>It's been a really busy month for Google as it apparently endeavors to outshine OpenAI with a blitz of AI releases. On Thursday, Google dropped its latest party trick: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental</a>, which is a new AI model that uses runtime "reasoning" techniques similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/">OpenAI's o1</a> to achieve "deeper thinking" on problems fed into it.</p>
<p>The experimental model builds on Google's newly released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and runs on its AI Studio platform, but early tests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">conducted</a> by TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers reveal accuracy issues with some basic tasks, such as incorrectly counting that the word "strawberry" contains two R's.</p>
<p>These so-called reasoning models differ from standard AI models by incorporating feedback loops of self-checking mechanisms, similar to techniques we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/hype-grows-over-autonomous-ai-agents-that-loop-gpt-4-outputs/">first saw in early 2023</a> with hobbyist projects like "Baby AGI." The process requires more computing time, often adding extra seconds or minutes to response times. Companies have turned to reasoning models as traditional scaling methods at training time have been showing diminishing returns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>Another company has publicly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">cut ties with Broadcom's VMware</a>. This time, it's Ingram Micro, one of the world's biggest IT distributors. The announcement comes as Broadcom eyes services as a key part of maintaining VMware business in 2025. But even as some customers are reducing reliance on VMware, its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/broadcom-rallies-forecast-booming-ai-chip-demand-2024-12-13/">trillion-dollar</a> owner is laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<h2>IT distributor severs VMware ties</h2>
<p>Ingram is reducing its Broadcom-related business to "limited engagement with VMware in select regions," a spokesperson told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">The Register</a> this week.</p>
<p>"We were unable to reach an agreement with Broadcom that would help our customers deliver the best technology outcomes now and in the future while providing an appropriate shareholder return,‚Äù the spokesperson said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/as-firms-abandon-vmware-broadcom-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>On Thursday, a large group of university and private industry researchers unveiled <a href="https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/">Genesis</a>, a new open source computer simulation system that lets robots practice tasks in simulated reality 430,000 times faster than in the real world. Researchers also plan to introduce an AI agent to generate 3D physics simulations from text prompts.</p>
<p>The accelerated simulation means a neural network for piloting robots can spend the virtual equivalent of decades learning to pick up objects, walk, or manipulate tools during just hours of real computer time.</p>
<p>"One hour of compute time gives a robot 10 years of training experience.

Friendships can change how we see and move through the world. They can boost our academic performance, help us deal with setbacks, and even improve our health. And the relationships we form in adolescence can shape our beliefs, values, and emotional growth. But making and maintaining friends isn‚Äôt always easy. Iseult Gillespie shares how to build healthy friendship habits.

If the latest battle in the AI wars is between open and closed models, Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg is right on the frontlines. Since rebranding as Meta in 2021, the trillion-dollar company, formerly known as Facebook, has been pouring billions into its long term bets on artificial intelligence and the metaverse. Meta‚Äôs latest push is a major play to open-source AI, in contrast to Google and Open AI. In an exclusive interview, Bloomberg‚Äôs Emily Chang sits down with Zuckerberg to discuss how the company‚Äôs newest AI model Llama 3.1 will shape the future of business, technology and society. She also visits his retreat in Lake Tahoe to talk about his personal evolution as a leader, and learns how to wake surf with Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.

Hosted by high-profile journalist Emily Chang, The Circuit is a fast-paced, dynamic series that lives at the intersection of culture, tech, entertainment, and business. Every week, Chang will go on location to meet the world‚Äôs most fascinating founders, influencers, and innovators, conducting intimate interviews and bringing audiences behind the scenes of the most impactful stories, launches, and trends.

I explain how neuroplasticity differs in children and adults, highlighting the key neurochemicals required for adult learning. I explain science-supported protocols to boost alertness and improve attention, including techniques like visual focus and goal accountability. I also discuss how sleep, along with practices such as non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) and naps, support the brain to enhance learning. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

The first movie was a nice little diversion from COVID, but the sequel was quite irritating--and with the same director and writers back for another go-around, I figured we were in for another round of "more of the same." Fortunately for all of us, I was wrong: The threequel successfully reins in the pop culture references and Jim Carrey's wackiness just enough, while also giving us a serious villain for the first time with Keanu Reeves's Shadow, and the result is that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 works better for audiences of all ages than its predecessors, which were more squarely aimed at children.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic 3 picks up some time after the last movie, and the Wachowskis have adopted Tails and Knuckles along with Sonic--they've got a nice little family unit going. Robotnik, meanwhile, is very depressed, just hanging out in his crab mech binge-eating snacks and binge-watching telenovelas. In other words, all is well. At least until an unknown person manages to free the mysterious Shadow the Hedgehog from stasis, letting him loose to pursue revenge for something that happened long ago and putting him into conflict with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.</p><p dir="ltr">That unknown person was, it turns out, another Dr. Robotnik--grandpa to the one we know (but still played by Jim Carrey). Robotnik Sr. and Shadow are allies, having shared a deep trauma decades earlier that is driving them both to extreme lengths for revenge. The younger Robotnik, the one who was a bad guy in the other two movies, serves as a wild card, because he wants to team up with his grandad but has a pretty different ultimate goal.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Young People Are in So Much Debt</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjAXWAp0S0s</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 20:19:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It‚Äôs not all in your head.

How Gen Z Ended Up in So Much Debt üëâ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-31/why-gen-z-is-sinking-deeper-into-debt-explained

Younger Americans face a financial crisis. Their growing debt burden has far outpaced that of older generations, and it‚Äôs only getting worse. Generation Z is being hit the hardest, thanks to lower income and the rising cost of everything from food to housing. Bloomberg takes a look at the roots of this problem, and whether anything can be done.

This video is presented by Destination Vancouver. Learn more about Vancouver at findyourrefresh.com. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

Movie magic is what makes our favorite films so good: Actors flawlessly inhabiting the personalities of totally made-up characters, visual effects transforming a green screen to an otherworldly setting, musical scores making us feel every emotion under the sun. But there‚Äôs another kind of magic we don‚Äôt talk about as much: one physical location masquerading as another. And it happens all the time.

When filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn‚Äôt as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and ‚Äî perhaps most importantly ‚Äî one that fits their budget. 

All these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. 

This is especially true for holiday movies ‚Äî many of which are filmed in Canada. In this video, we talk to a prolific Christmas movie producer ‚Äî who has worked on films like 2024‚Äôs Netflix hit Hot Frosty ‚Äî about shooting movies in Canada. 

Correction: In a previous version of this video we mistakenly said that Clark Kent's farm in the TV show Smallville was in Kentucky at :58 and 1:13. The Kent family farm was actually in Kansas. We've corrected the error.

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>ncus and Docker both use Linux kernel features to containerize your applications. Incus is best suited when you need system-level containers that act like traditional VMs and provide a persistent developer experience. On the other hand, Docker containers are ephemeral, i.e., temporary in nature. All files created inside Docker containers are lost when your Docker container is stopped or removed unless you stored them using volumes in different directories outside Docker. Docker is created as a disposable app deployment system. Incus containers are not typically created as disposables, and data is kept inside when they are stopped. Because of the Linux kernel support nesting feature, you can run Docker inside Incus. This page explains how to run Docker inside Incus containers.</p>

He is a physicist who immigrated to the United States to conduct research on particle physics, later transitioning to chaos theory before moving into computer science and quantum computing. As his last name suggests, he is also my father.

In this episode, we explore what it means to let curiosity guide major career decisions‚Äîthe benefits, the risks, and the challenge of balancing career ambitions with everyday life.

The audio in this clip features his response to a question I asked during the podcast: ‚ÄúDo you have any wishes for me‚Äî[and for anyone wondering what to aspire to in life]?‚Äù

Our conversation also delves into topics like science, family, leaving a politically unstable country for the United States, social dynamics, patriotism, the tension between tradition and self-expression, and, of course, the relationship between parents and children‚Äîincluding why a bit of rebellion can foster personal growth when it serves a meaningful purpose.

This was obviously a deeply meaningful episode for me to record, given that Dr. Huberman is my father. I also believe the discussion will resonate broadly, particularly with those who frequently switch fields of interest‚Äîa journey Dr. Huberman has embraced repeatedly over more than five decades.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Georgian Christmas</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/georgian-christmas-</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<ituneshack><p>Pantomimes, pleasure gardens, bare-knuckle boxing and political upheaval.

In August 2023, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century reduced much of the Hawaiian town of Lahaina to ashes, killing more than 100 people and displacing thousands. Coming in the wake of a state investigation that found a broad cascade of failures, ‚ÄúMaui‚Äôs Deadly Firestorm‚Äù investigates critical missteps that day ‚Äî and in the years prior, as the county and state were repeatedly advised to invest more money in prevention and preparedness, and as experts and residents raised concerns.

The documentary draws on harrowing footage filmed by those in the path of the inferno and firsthand accounts from survivors, victims‚Äô families and friends, first responders, and local and state authorities. Through these accounts as well as a detailed analysis of over a thousand 911 calls and public records across multiple government agencies, it provides a wrenching, moment-by-moment reconstruction of the fire and its aftermath. 

The film also examines how changes to the climate and landscape have made Maui increasingly vulnerable to fires and raises difficult questions about what led to the fire‚Äôs heavy toll.

‚ÄúMaui‚Äôs Deadly Firestorm‚Äù is a FRONTLINE production with Mandarin Duck Films LLC. The writer, producer and director is Xinyan Yu. The producer is Christina Avalos. The senior producer is Frank Koughan. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

Domino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua "Alex" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.

// Abstract
Given the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.

// Bio
Guanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training. He holds a CS PhD from UC Berkeley advised by Prof Ion Stoica.

--

Charles Darwin introduced the notion of ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest,‚Äù where the fittest animals are those who can survive long enough to produce healthy offspring. The fittest animal can also be the most stealthy, resourceful, or even the most cooperative. So what exactly does cooperation look like in the wild? Ashley Ward digs into the animal kingdom's capacity for generosity.

We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  

We explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. 

But our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house.
