In a new filing Friday, America's Justice Department "reiterated its November proposal that Google be forced to sell its Chrome web browser," reports the Washington Post, "to address a federal judge finding the company guilty of being an illegal monopoly in August."

The government also kept a proposal that Google be banned from paying other companies to give its search engine preferential placement on their apps and phones. At the same time, the government dropped its demand that Google sell its stakes in AI start-ups after one of the start-ups, Anthropic AI, argued that it needed Google's money to compete in the fast-growing industry. 

The government's final proposal "reaffirms that Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point — to provide an opportunity for a new rival to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google's monopoly control," Justice Department lawyers wrote in the filing... Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who had ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly, will decide on the final remedies in April. 
 The article quotes a Google spokesperson's response: that the Justice Department's "sweeping" proposals "continue to go miles beyond the court's decision, and would harm America's consumers, economy and national security."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Panama releases dozens of migrants deported from the US</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jC_XyKBE0A</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-jC_XyKBE0A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Panama has released dozens of migrants deported from the United States who were held for weeks in a remote camp on the condition that they would leave the Central American nation in 30 days.

I am using a proxmox VM with Debian 12, installed AdGuard Home via the automated install (GitHub - AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome: Network-wide ads & trackers blocking DNS server), the VM was reinstalled clean twice but the problem persists.

In the journalctl log, there is nothing to see at the time, AdGuard Home stops responding, the only thing thats remarkable is, that stopping the process fails with timeout:Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564208 [info] Received signal "terminated"Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564254 [info] stopping AdGuard HomeMar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564322 [info] webapi: stopping http serverMar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564422 [info] webapi: stopped http serverMar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564427 [info] service: stopping: waiting for cleanupMar 09 00:15:00 adguard systemd[1]: Stopping AdGuardHome.service - AdGuard Home: Network-level blocker...Mar 09 00:16:30 adguard systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: State 'stop-sigterm' timed out.

Today the Washington Post remembers he'd vowed his Republican party would use their "best efforts" to eliminate it. 

But it's still proving to be politically difficult...

Polls have shown that most Americans oppose the time shifts but disagree on what should replace them... [U.S. political leaders] also say they are grappling with whether the nation should permanently move the clocks forward one hour, an idea championed by lawmakers on the coasts who say it would allow for more sunshine during the winter, or remain on year-round standard time, which is favored by neurologists who say it aligns with our circadian rhythms. That decision would rest with Congress, not the president. The split often reflects regional, not political, differences, based on where time zones fall; a year-round "spring forward" would mean winter sunrises that could creep past 9 a.m. in cities such as Indianapolis and Detroit, prompting many local lawmakers to oppose the idea... 

[A 2022 Senate vote to make Daylight Saving Time permanent] awoke a new lobbying effort from advocates such as the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which warned that year-round daylight saving time would be unhealthy, citing risks such as higher rates of obesity or metabolic dysfunction. Some researchers warned of a condition dubbed "social jetlag," saying that internal body clocks and rhythms would be persistently misaligned if human clocks were permanently set forward an hour. The concerted resistance from the health groups — which some congressional aides jokingly referred to as "Big Sleep" — helped kill the measure in the House and has contributed to a stalemate over how to proceed... 
 Today, roughly two-thirds of Americans want to end the clock changes, polls show. But even those Americans don't agree on what should come next. An October 2023 YouGov poll found that 33 percent of respondents wanted year-round daylight saving time, 23 percent wanted permanent standard time, and 9 percent had no preference. The remainder weren't sure or preferred to remain on the current system... The political fight is far from over, with Trump allies such as Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama) pledging to keep pushing for year-round daylight saving time. Some congressional Republicans also have privately called for a hearing in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with hopes of advancing the Sunshine Protection Act.

But a new clinical trial has repaired this damage in patients thanks to a transplant of stem cells from their healthy eyes.The cornea is the outer layer of the eye, which focuses light towards the retina. Since it’s on the frontline of potential hazards from the outside world, the cornea features a population of limbal epithelial stem cells, which repair minor damage to keep the surface smooth and functional.Unfortunately, injuries like thermal or chemical burns can damage the cornea beyond the capability of these resident stem cells. There’s not much else that can be done – even a cornea transplant won’t take hold if the damage is too severe.The new study, conducted by scientists at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, investigated a new treatment called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells (CALEC). This involves removing stem cells from a patient’s uninjured eye, growing their population in the lab for a few weeks, then surgically transplanting them into the injured eye.The phase 1/2 trial recruited 14 patients to undergo the procedure, and followed them for 18 months afterwards. Success was primarily judged by how effectively the treatment repaired the cornea’s surface, while a secondary test analyzed improvements to visual acuity.By the first checkup at three months, the corneas of seven (50%) of the participants had been completely restored. By the 12-month mark, that number had increased to 11 (79%) patients. Two other participants met the definition for partial success, so the team claims an overall success rate of 92% for CALEC.It’s worth noting that three participants did require a second transplant of stem cells, with one of them going on to reach the mark of complete success by the end of the study. In tests of visual acuity in the damaged eye, the majority of patients regained some sight, with some advancing from legally blind to low vision.No serious adverse effects that were attributed to the procedure were seen in the patients, in either the donor or recipient eyes. The researchers say that this success paves the way for further trials with larger cohorts and longer follow-ups, before CALEC is submitted for FDA approval.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Norway: Oil platform workers demand compensation | Focus on Europe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCN3OcY6y0k</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kCN3OcY6y0k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 06:15:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Norwegian offshore oil workers often face occupational health issues due to the hazardous nature of their work.

"Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a license," the letter complained. 
"These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them. Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies' mass theft of human artists' work." CNET reports that the signers "range from illustrators to authors to art therapists to cinematographers, from countries all across the globe." 

Christie's ignored them all and held the auction anyways. So what happened when it was over on Wednesday morning?

More than 30 lots attracted hundreds of bids and brought in $728,784, Christie's reports. And there's a generational twist: The auction house says 37% of registrants were completely new to Christie's, and 48% of bidders were millennials or members of Gen Z... The highest price in the sale was $277,200 for a work by Refik Anadol titled Machine Hallucinations — ISS Dreams — A. It used a data set of more than 1.2 million images taken from the International Space Station and satellites. 


ARTnews reports that the auction actually brought in more than Christie's had expected:
The sale, which made up of 34 lots, had an 82 percent sell through rate... While some digital artists, including Beeple, championed the sale, others decried it as emblematic of the ongoing struggle between human artistry and machine-driven innovation. The results, however, suggest that AI art — controversial as it may be — is carving a firm place in the market.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Man who scaled London&apos;s Big Ben clock tower with Palestinian flag comes down</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6_bdknUDPc</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/s6_bdknUDPc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 05:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A man who brought central London to a halt after climbing one of the capital's landmark buildings has now returned to the ground.

This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I liked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is there any way to change the color of code block text?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1j6xs3m/is_there_any_way_to_change_the_color_of_code/</link><author>/u/Melendrow</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 02:42:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Obsidian</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I'm using the Obuntu theme (Git hub page) and the theme changes the code block text to make it red, and I'm curious if there's any way I can change it.

Sooo I've started my own project of "Modular Organic Smart System" short for  project.I wanted design my project with following requirement, out from previous failed attempts at growing plants in my apartment and office. (also heavily inspired by Voron project)- Either plant or LED should be enough for lighting (also no red and purple led)- Has to be modular on both electronics and pot units for different plant's requirements- Parts should be easy to gather- Ease of printing and assemblyDesigning was not really difficult but making panels and electronics parts fit was very challenging(First fully assembled model has huge gap in panel mount lol). But things went well and I'm in the process of finishing and making BOM for this project and publishing full 3d model.Current features are led brightness control, fan speed control, soil moisture sensor powered by .

"It was weird. It was community-driven. It's time to rebuild that. 

"Which is why Kevin Rose and I just bought back Digg." 

The amount of that purchase is "undisclosed," reports CNBC:

The deal is backed by venture capital firms True Ventures, where Rose is a partner, and Ohanian's Seven Seven Six.... The company said in a release that it aims to differentiate itself in the social media market by "focusing on AI innovations designed to enhance the user experience and build a human-centered alternative...." Rose said in a post on X that he and Ohanian "dreamed up features that weren't even possible with yesterday's tech." 

"We're bringing more transparency and community partnership," according to Rose's post, "unlike anything you've seen, plus AI that unlocks creativity without sanitizing the human element. The timing is finally right to reimagine what's possible." 

"I really disliked you for a long time," Ohanian tells Rose in their joint announcement video. (To which a cheery Rose responds, "Rightfully so.") 

But in the video Ohanian also says that today "Our perspective on the world has shifted a lot. You don't want to live in the past, but now we actually have the technology to make better, healthier community experiences." ("Old Rivals, New Vision," says a post on Digg's X.com account, urging readers to "Sign up to get early access when invites go live.") 

And Digg.com now just displays this teasing catchphrase. "The front page of the internet, now with superpowers." (At the top of the page there's also a link to watch Diggnation Live at SXSW.) 

While valued at $160 million dollars in 2008, Digg's plummeting traffic led to its brand and web site being acquired in 2012 by tech incubator Betaworks for about $500,000, according to CNBC...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>More like LabGore</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1j6wxyp/more_like_labgore/</link><author>/u/braziNoNo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 01:56:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Slowly getting somewhere with my setup, this might be more like LabGore than LabPorn.

"At stake is the future of not just the AGPLv3, but the FSF's widely used GNU Public License it is largely based on, and the software covered by those agreements."

 A core tenet of the GPL series is that free software remains free forever, and this is woven into the licenses' fine print. This ongoing legal battle is a matter of whether people can alter those licenses and redistribute code as they see fit in a non-free way, or if they must stick to the terms of an agreement that says the terms cannot be changed...
If the Ninth Circuit upholds the [original district court] ruling, it's likely to create a binding precedent that would limit one of the major freedoms that AGPLv3 and other GPL licenses aim to protect — the ability to remove restrictions added to GPL licensed code. 


"Neo4j appended an additional nonfree commercial restriction, the Commons Clause, to a verbatim version of the GNU AGPLv3 in a version of its software..." according to an FSF announcement this week. "The FSF's position on such confusing licensing practices has always been clear: the GNU licenses explicitly allow users to remove restrictions incompatible with the four freedoms." (You can read their amicus brief here.)

Currently, the Wi-Fi MAC layer of the ESP32 is closed-source.
This project aims to change that: by reverse engineering the hardware registers and software, we can build a networking stack that is open-source up to the hardware, instead of having to use the proprietary MAC layer.This will improve security auditability, open up the possibility for features not supported in the proprietary implementation (for example, standards-compliant mesh networking), improve interoperability and make research into Wi-Fi networks with lots of nodes more affordable.esp32-open-mac (we know it's confusing that one reference implementation has the same name as the overarching project, but bear with us)
This is a reference implementation that demonstrates how the hardware works, written in C and Rust: the hardware abstraction and initialization is written in C; the MAC stack (parsing packets and deciding which packets to send when) is written in Rust.
This relies on two FreeRTOS tasks; one to handle the hardware, one to handle the MAC stack.Ferris-on-Air (FoA): this is a reference implementation in pure async Rust. It builds on Embassy and the patches in the esp-hal we submitted to add support for the Wi-Fi peripheral.If you want to help out with developing or want to contact us, feel free to join the Matrix room]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poland opens their first abortion center that uses pills to terminate pregnancies | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lkMA9WqQo4</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2lkMA9WqQo4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 00:32:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of people have marched through central Berlin to celebrate International Women's Day.

Berlin is one of only two German states that treat International Women's Day as an official public holiday.

Poland also hosted demonstrations for International Women's Day. Activists opened the country's first center where women can have abortions using pills. It's located directly opposite the parliament building. The predominantly Catholic country has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, but the frontrunner in this year's presidential election aims to change that.

It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. 

"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox," reports the Register.
 Axiom Space said: "The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity." 

Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: "Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency...." 

The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... "AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years." 
The article notes that HPE has also "sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers — commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers — over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions." (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) "At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program." 

Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to "reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis."

By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. 
The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup & disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.

Trudeau announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen. Election laws mandate a vote before October but one is expected sooner. Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are cancelling trips south and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in Parliamentary elections that are expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States. Carney navigated crises when he was the head of Canada’s central bank and when he became the first non-citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.Carney is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever of 1%, working with bankers to sustain lending through the crisis and, critically, letting the public know rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing.And it wasn’t just that he had good policies — he sold them to the public in a way everyone could understand. He was the first central banker to commit to keep them at a historic low for a definite time, a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow.Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January.The other top Liberal leadership candidate is former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.Three points turned the leadership race into a runaway for Carney. Freeland had a long association with the unpopular Trudeau. Carney worked hard to gather support from Liberal members of Parliament members. And Trump’s tariff fixation was also pivotal, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. “Liberal backbenchers feared losing their seats and knew that Carney was more electable as their leader than Freeland,” Wiseman said. The Liberal Party members will pick a new leader in a secret vote by about 140,000 members that will be announced on Sunday. The new leader is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote this month. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Carney’s calm demeanor and outstanding resume make him a reassuring figure to many Canadians at a time when Trump is going after their country’s economy and sovereignty.Béland said that style and profile stands in strong contrast to the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre, whom he called a true career politician who has embraced a populist rhetoric not unlike Trump's. Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who says he will to put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster and cut taxes. “That works with his base but that is not welcomed by other Canadians, especially considering what the U.S. president is now saying about, and doing to, their country,” Béland said. Poilievre urged Trump on Friday stop the attacks on Canada and “the monthly melodrama that is hurting our economies on both side of the border."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New DOJ proposal still calls for Google to divest Chrome, but allows for AI investments</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/08/new-doj-proposal-still-calls-for-google-to-divest-chrome-but-allows-for-ai-investments/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 22:04:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is still calling for Google to sell its web browser Chrome, according to a Friday court filing.  The DOJ first proposed that Google should sell Chrome last year, under then-President Joe Biden, but it seems to be sticking with that plan under the second Trump administration.

But it's part of a larger trend:

In one of the final acts of President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned Red No. 3, effective in January 2027 for food, one of a handful of synthetic colors that have become something of a symbol of all that is wrong with the American food system and the ultraprocessed foods that dominate it. Putting Red No. 3 aside, the rest of the colors remain legal, and they're used in tens of thousands of supermarket and convenience-store products in the United States, according to NielsenIQ data. The recent campaign against them became one of the pillars of the "Make America Healthy Again" movement championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The criticism follows what health advocates have been saying for years: The synthetic colors add nothing to taste, nutritional value or shelf life but make unhealthy foods more visually appealing. Worst of all, there are concerns that the dyes may be carcinogenic or trigger hyperactivity in some kids. 
[Ian Puddephat, vice president of research and development for food ingredients at PepsiCo] says PepsiCo is "on a mission to get them out of the portfolio as much as we can"... PepsiCo has a dozen brands, including Simply, that don't have the artificial dyes, and the company is working to pull them out of an additional eight brands in the next year. 
Other companies are trying too, according to the article. Though Ironically, "the supply chain for colors like a radish's red or annatto's orange is not as robust as that for Red No. 40 or Yellow No. 6."

 But there's also been some success stories:

In 2016, Kraft Heinz Foods Co. announced that it'd made good on an earlier promise to get artificial dyes out of its recipe — and apparently, nobody noticed. "We just haven't told that story," says Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Kraft Heinz's CEO. (The lack of artificial dyes is more prominent on the boxes now...)

For my example, I'll use my Xbox Core Wireless Controller. The expected behavior that happens on all other computers is as follows:Controller is put into pairing mode, LED begins to flash quickly.Controller becomes visible to computer, and is listed under devices that can be paired.I select the controller to pair it.Computer says pairing is successful. LED on controller stops flashing and holds solid.Controller functions perfectly.For my Pi, however, I get through the first 3, but even though the Pi says that pairing is successful, the controller continues to flash as though it has not been paired. On Batocera, this is particularly egregious because it will fill the screen with connected/disconnected messages, constantly going back and forth. And since the controller hasn't exited pairing mode, it shuts down a short time later.I've tried this on both Batocera and Pi OS with the same results. Both images and everything on them are 100% up-to-date. The Pi is getting a full 25W power supply. I am aware of the existence of adapter dongles, but I have seen people use bluetooth controllers with a Pi 5 without a dongle, no issues. I have searched around to no avail to find a dongle-less solution that isn't just sudo apt update.Any help would be greatly appreciated :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[FS][US-TX][DFW] Unifi switches and access pointsUS-16-XG, US-16-150W, US-24-POE, UAP-AC-Pro, UAP-AC-Lite, UAP-AC-LR, US-48, 10G DAC cables</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1j6qsdv/fsustxdfw_unifi_switches_and_access_pointsus16xg/</link><author>/u/rmtronix</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 20:57:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab Sales</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have the following Ubiquiti gear for sale.

"The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices, unauthorized data access, pivoting to other devices on the network, and potentially establishing long-term persistence."

This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security, who presented their findings yesterday at RootedCON in Madrid. "Tarlogic Security has detected a backdoor in the ESP32, a microcontroller that enables WiFi and Bluetooth connection and is present in millions of mass-market IoT devices," reads a Tarlogic announcement shared with BleepingComputer. "Exploitation of this backdoor would allow hostile actors to conduct impersonation attacks and permanently infect sensitive devices such as mobile phones, computers, smart locks or medical equipment by bypassing code audit controls...." 



Tarlogic developed a new C-based USB Bluetooth driver that is hardware-independent and cross-platform, allowing direct access to the hardware without relying on OS-specific APIs. Armed with this new tool, which enables raw access to Bluetooth traffic, Targolic discovered hidden vendor-specific commands (Opcode 0x3F) in the ESP32 Bluetooth firmware that allow low-level control over Bluetooth functions. In total, they found 29 undocumented commands, collectively characterized as a "backdoor," that could be used for memory manipulation (read/write RAM and Flash), MAC address spoofing (device impersonation), and LMP/LLCP packet injection. 

Espressif has not publicly documented these commands, so either they weren't meant to be accessible, or they were left in by mistake.

The “Voice Memo” note just serves as an initial landing zone to get ideas out of my head quickly.Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WALL OF SHAME - &quot;Why does this Proxmox node keep hanging on boot?!?&quot;</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1j6pt3x/wall_of_shame_why_does_this_proxmox_node_keep/</link><author>/u/iansaul</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 20:12:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Self Hosted</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This SilverStone RM43-320-RS sounds like it's trying to take off when all three of the 120MM fans are plugged into the back of the disk controller for power. You'd think there was a mini-tornado in my office, and you can hear it all the way across the house.I figured NO PROBLEM, nothing a little lm-sensors and fancontrol can't fix. After running into issues with this particular MOBO, I went in a totally different direction.Why not use BIOS fan curves on the MSI MPG Z590 GAMING PLUS, to avoid worrying about any OS or docker based solutions. That appeared to work like a charm... in BIOS... with an HDMI monitor plugged in.But on reboot.... system shows hung....Must be the lm-sensors.... GRUB e - bypass loading components... no luck. GRUB e - emergency...... finally back in... Ok... well... lucky me I did a ZFS snapshot RIGHT before starting any of these shenanigans. Rollback the snapshot....At this point, I'm thinking... "Ok... this system booted up FINE before... this is either due to BIOS control of the PWM fans.... or this MONITOR is hanging the boot.... which makes ZERO SENSE."On a whim, I checked if I could SSH... lo and behold:root@*********'s password:Blimey. She's not hung at all, never has been. I have the GPU in passthrough so that we can Sunshine to the LR TV.I didn't need that hour of my life anyways.Hope it brings a chuckle to others, like it did me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google scrubs mentions of ‘diversity’ and ‘equity’ from responsible AI team webpage</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/08/google-scrubs-mentions-of-diversity-and-equity-from-responsible-ai-team-webpage/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 20:08:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has quietly updated the webpage for its Responsible AI and Human Centered Technology (RAI-HCT) team, the team charged with conducting research into AI safety, fairness, and explainability, to scrub mentions of “diversity” and “equity.” A previous version of the page used language such as “marginalized communities,” “diverse,” “underrepresented groups,” and “equity” to describe the […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020... The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs. Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. 

The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population — including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases... 

Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said. Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems. 
Just three months ago the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said America's western migratory populations of monarch butterflies had declined by more than 95% since the 1980s, putting them "at greater than 99% chance of extinction by 2080." (America's eastern migratory population were estimated to have declined by approximately 80%.) 

This latest study found that one factor is climate change, according to CBS News, which reduces food sources, disrupts breeding cycles and increases habitat stress. (Another factor is pesticide use, which fortunately can be adjusted with various policy interventions and farming practices.) 

And one of the study's co-authors tells CBS News that "the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference." They recommend allowing backyard to "grow wild" with native plants (and reducing pesticide use) — even creating "habitat spaces" for insects like small piles of brush. "Even simple actions — like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators — can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Merz and SPD clear first hurdle to forming German coalition | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjVZx6btL94</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BjVZx6btL94?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 19:31:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[German election winner Friedrich Merz's conservatives and the Social Democrats concluded preliminary talks on forming a coalition government, promising to get tough on illegal migration and to support industry and boost the economy.

I recently created my very own cryptocurrency exchange aggregator called cyphergoat; it finds you the best rate to swap your crypto from different partnered exchanges.An API that interacts with exchanges. Written in go and uses gin.The Web UI is written in go and uses a combination of HTML, HTMX, tailwindcss, CSS, and Javascript in templ templates. Aka the GoTTH stack. It interacts with the API in order to find rates etc.\
What is extremely cool with this stack and setup is that we are able to produce  with everything included for each part and ship it to the server. On the webui side, this is possible since the HTML is compiled into go code using templ and then shipped with the binary.\
In this article, I will be going through my setup to make it easier for you to make something like this.I am using a Debian 12 server which will expose my application via Cloudflare tunnels. All of the static files are being served via nginx and the API and website binaries are ran as systemd services.\
In this guide, I will show you how I set this up.I have a single folder on my dev machine called cyphergoat: It contains:\
The API folder houses the API source code. The web houses the website source code.\
And the builds houses all of the builds that are deployed to the server.The first real challenge comes with setting up tailwindcss correctly.\
In my web project, I have a static folder specifically for static files. Inside of it, I have two files:/web
    styles.css
    tailwind.css
\
The  simply contains:\
The tailwind.css file is where tailwind-cli will save its stuff.\
To build the tailwind stuff, I simply run:npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./static/styles.css -o ./static/tailwind.css --watch
(assuming you have tailwind-cli installed)\
In my header.templ file (the header of all the pages), at the top I have:<link href="/static/tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet">

<link href="/static/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
\
And the files are being served using Echo’s e.Static (in my main.go file).func main(){
e := echo.New()

e.Use(middleware.Logger())
e.Use(middleware.Recover())
e.Use(middleware.Secure())


e.Static("/static", "static") // Serves content from static folder.

// Rest of the handlers
}
On my server side, I have a Debian 12 vm running on proxmox.\
In my users home directory, I have a folder with the following contents:cyphergoat/
├── api
├── static/
└── web
The static folder contains all of the static files (including tailwind.css and styles.css), and the  and  are the binaries.\
I then have two systemd services for these executables:The /etc/systemd/system/cg-api.service[Unit]
Description=CypherGoat API
After=network.target

[Service]
User=arkal
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/arkal/cyphergoat
ExecStart=/home/arkal/cyphergoat/api
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
\
And /etc/systemd/system/cg-web.service[Unit]
Description=CypherGoat Web
After=network.target

[Service]
User=arkal
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/arkal/cyphergoat
ExecStart=/home/arkal/cyphergoat/web


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Both are owned by the group  (this is probably not necessary for the API) in order to make it easier to serve them via nginx.The website is communicating with the API, but I still need to make the web-ui accessible.\
I have set up an nginx site with the following configuration: /etc/nginx/sites-available/cgserver {
    server_name cyphergoat.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4200;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /static/ {
        alias /var/www/static/;
        expires 30d;
    }

    # Optional robots.txt
    location = /robots.txt {
        root /var/www/static;
        access_log off;
        log_not_found off;
    }

    listen 80;
}
I have also set up certbot to have an SSL cert.\
You can set certbot by running:sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d cyphergoat.com
I am currently making my website accessible using Cloudflare pages. It is an extremely easy-to-use port-forwarding solution.\
To do this, you will need a Cloudflare account and a domain pointed to Cloudflare.\
Under  click on  and then \
Once created, you should Install and run a connector; follow the instructions on the page for your specific setup.\
After the connector is running, you should click on the  tab and .\
Now, you should see something like this:  \
Fill in the info as I have. The service type should be , and the URL should be  or \
Obviously, there is no reason to make your API publicly accessible when deploying your website.In order to deploy my binaries, I went ahead and created a quick bash script:cd api
go build -o ../builds/ .

cd ../web

templ generate && go build -o ../builds/web cmd/main.go

cd ..
rsync -urvP ./builds/ user@SERVER:/home/user/cyphergoat
rsync -urvP ./web/static user@SERVER:/home/user/cyphergoat/
rsync -urvP ./api/coins.json user@SERVER:/user/user/cyphergoat/
The script will build the API, generate the templ files build the WebUI, and then send everything over to my server (including the static folder).\
I then ssh into my server:\
And then restart the services.sudo systemctl restart cg-api cg-web]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here&apos;s Why Your AI Has Bad Humor</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/heres-why-your-ai-has-bad-humor?source=rss</link><author>Chenuli J.</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 19:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever asked an AI model to tell you a joke and received something painfully unfunny? Something like:Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!\
More often than not, these so-called jokes generated by AI are weird and extremely predictable. The reason? It’s a machine! They do not have a human context— all it sees are patterns in the data they have been trained on, and when we ask them to tell a joke, they stitch together words based on probabilities rather than actual wit or comedic timing.\
This is not rocket science for someone who works with AI, but it’s interesting to see what makes it the way it is. With that understanding, you might also figure out how to “ask“ AI models for better jokes.AI “learns“ what a joke looks likeAn AI model (say, GPT or a joke-telling bot) isn't born with a sense of humor. Instead, it learns from thousands of joke examples scraped from books, websites, and conversations. But instead of  humor like we do, it recognizes statistical patterns.\
Here's an oversimplified look at how an AI model might process joke structures (completely different code, just for your understanding):import random
setup = ["Why did the chicken cross the road?", "What do you get when you mix AI with a comedian?", "Why don't programmers like nature?"]
punchline = ["To get to the other side!", "A neural network with bad timing!", "Too many bugs."]
print(random.choice(setup) + " " + random.choice(punchline))

# NOTE: This is oversimplified for easier understanding.
# Real AI models don't just randomly select from pre-written jokes.
# They use neural networks with billions of parameters to predict 
# the most likely next words based on patterns in their training data.
\
See the problem? It recognizes the  of a joke: first comes the set-up, and second comes the punchlines; it doesn't understand why a joke is funny.AI predicts the next words, not the funniest onesOutputs of AI models, whether humorous or not, solely operate on statistical probability. Large language models like GPT often work by predicting the most statistically likely next word(s). That's great for autocomplete and basic text generation, but terrible for original humor.\
For example, if the AI generates the setup: “Why did the chicken cross the road?”\
It predicts common responses for the punchline. Since "To get to the other side" is the most statistically probable answer, it will often generate that— even though it's the least funny.from collections import Counter

jokes_dataset = ["To get to the other side!", "Because it was programmed to!", "To escape the AI overlords!"]
probabilities = Counter(jokes_dataset)

# chooses the most frequent joke
print(probabilities.most_common(1)[0][0])
That’s why they are really predictable and repetitive.AI lacks context and world knowledgeHumor, unlike usual text generation, is deeply tied to emotions, human experiences, and cultures. Sad to say, they are the exact things AI fundamentally doesn’t grasp. Even with models trained on vast amounts of data, AI struggles when it comes to:Sarcasm: "Oh great, another AI-generated joke!"Wordplay & Puns: "An AI walks into a bar… and fails the Turing test."Social Awareness: "Why did the AI go to therapy? Because it couldn't process its feelings."\
Even though AI can recognize common joke formats, it doesn't  why something is funny. As a consequence, they try too hard to be funny.attempts = ["I'm hilarious, trust me!", "Why did the algorithm break up? It lost its spark!", "What's an AI's favorite drink? Java."]
print(random.choice(attempts))
\
And then again, who to blame? These are machines trained on not-so-lawfully obtained data. The last thing AI engineers would want to happen is being sued for training AI models on data extracted from stand-up comedians.To get better jokes from an AI, you’ve got to be specific. Tell it the style you want (maybe like Louis CK’s dark humor or Chandler Bing’s sarcasm), set the scene, and let it know what kind of humor you’re after. It wouldn’t make it 50 times better, but at least it wouldn’t be so plain and stiff.\
That’ll give AI a framework within which to work. Because right now, without context and an understanding of human emotions, all it can do is guess the punchline— usually in the most predictable, robotic way possible.\
That’s just 700 words, no summary is needed. See you next time!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploy from local to production (self-hosted)</title><link>https://github.com/bypirob/airo</link><author>bypirob</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:54:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chill Night Drives 🌸 Lofi Hip Hop [Stress Relief | Relaxing Music | Chill To]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7xD7l5bRTI</link><author>Chill Melodies</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N7xD7l5bRTI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:51:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_paGw9pf9RL79FzRsR1VQ">Chill Melodies</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chill Night Drives 🌸 Lofi Hip Hop [Stress Relief | Relaxing Music | Chill To]

The blockchain space is rapidly evolving, with new projects emerging to address existing challenges and push the boundaries of what decentralized technology can achieve. Solana (SOL), one of the leading blockchain networks, has been a favorite among developers due to its speed and scalability. However, recent issues with network congestion and centralized governance have caused many to reassess their involvement with Solana. As a result, some Solana developers are considering migrating to , a rising blockchain that promises to address many of Solana’s shortcomings with its innovative Layer 1 blockchain solution.\
Several Solana developers are now looking toward Coldware (COLD) as a promising alternative. Coldware’s ability to offer a fully decentralized network, combined with its innovative Layer 1 blockchain, makes it an attractive option for developers seeking a more secure and scalable environment. Solana’s ongoing issues with network congestion and centralization have made many developers reconsider their options, and Coldware’s decentralized nature and focus on scalability provide the perfect solution.\
Additionally, Coldware’s focus on , such as integrating blockchain with IoT and physical infrastructure, further sets it apart from Solana (SOL). As more industries look to implement blockchain solutions, Coldware’s approach to decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin) could become a key differentiator in the blockchain space.Coldware (COLD) Presents a Decentralized Solution is rapidly gaining attention for its decentralized Layer 1 blockchain, which aims to overcome the limitations faced by Solana (SOL). Coldware’s approach is built around its Mobile Litenodes, a unique innovation that allows individuals to participate in consensus and validation from mobile devices. This decentralized and mobile-first solution ensures that Coldware’s network remains scalable and efficient, even during periods of high traffic.\The ability for Coldware (COLD) to scale effectively through decentralized participation gives it a significant advantage over Solana (SOL). While Solana developers have faced challenges with network congestion and governance, Coldware’s decentralized architecture provides a viable alternative that could attract developers looking for a more sustainable and decentralized platform.Solana (SOL) Faces Scalability and Centralization Issues (SOL) has long been recognized for its high throughput and low transaction costs. However, as its popularity grew, so did the network congestion, particularly during periods of peak demand. Solana’s network, while fast, has suffered from slowdowns and outages, leading to frustrations among developers and users. These scalability issues are compounded by the increasing centralization of the network, which has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability and true decentralization of the platform.\
Solana developers are now facing a dilemma: continue with Solana (SOL), despite its ongoing issues, or explore alternatives that promise more scalability and decentralization.The Migration to Coldware (COLD)As Solana developers look for alternatives, many are considering migrating to Coldware (COLD) for its decentralized and scalable solution. The transition to  could offer developers the opportunity to build more secure and efficient applications without the constraints of Solana’s current limitations. Coldware’s innovative approach to scalability and decentralization provides an appealing option for developers seeking to avoid the issues faced by Solana’s centralized network.\The growing interest in Coldware (COLD) among Solana developers is a testament to the network’s potential. As more developers migrate to Coldware’s platform, its ecosystem will continue to grow, further cementing its place as a leader in the blockchain space.Final Thoughts: Coldware (COLD) Is Poised to Lead the Next Era of BlockchainWhile Solana (SOL) has been a dominant player in the blockchain space, its ongoing issues with scalability and decentralization have prompted many developers to seek alternatives. Coldware (COLD) is quickly emerging as the next big thing, with its decentralized Layer 1 blockchain providing a solution to the limitations faced by Solana. As more developers make the switch,  is set to become a major player in the blockchain industry, offering a more secure, scalable, and decentralized platform for the future of blockchain technology.\

"Until recently..."


Now, from behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Bankman-Fried is orchestrating an extraordinary public-relations blitz that looks very much like a campaign to make the most audacious trade of his career: support for President Trump's agenda in return for a presidential pardon... 

There is little downside to Bankman-Fried's long-shot effort to secure a pardon. As the appeal that he filed last year works its way through the courts, Bankman-Fried, 33, is staring down a prison sentence that could extend until his 50s... The crowning touch of his campaign came on Thursday, when Bankman-Fried gave a jailhouse interview to "The Tucker Carlson Show," which was released on social-media channels including X and YouTube. Appearing on video in a brown jumpsuit, he criticized Washington bureaucrats and crypto regulators — and suggested that he went to prison out of political retribution... [Carlson's title for the interview? "Sam Bankman-Fried on Life in Prison With Diddy, and How Democrats Stole His Money and Betrayed Him."]

 

The interview hadn't been approved by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bankman-Fried spoke with Carlson through a link that is typically used by inmates to communicate with their lawyers, the person said. After the interview, Bankman-Fried was placed in solitary confinement, but he was out by Friday afternoon, according to a person familiar with the matter... Bankman-Fried is trying to highlight in media appearances and in any interaction with Trump's team that FTX customers are set to be made whole with interest through the bankruptcy proceedings — at least in dollar terms. Many of those creditors remain furious that they missed out on bitcoin's rally since November 2022. 
Bankman-Fried "wants to set the record straight on his political beliefs, which he believes have been misconstrued," according to the article. "While he has given heavily to Democrats, he has also donated to Republican causes, including the contribution of millions to a group supporting Senator Mitch McConnell." 

But the New York Times, citing "people with knowledge" of his pardon-seeking efforts, reported that "So far, the push does not appear to have gained traction."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PayFi Revolution on the Horizon</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/payfi-revolution-on-the-horizon?source=rss</link><author>Coldware</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:24:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
The crypto market is filled with potential and uncertainty, especially when considering the futures of established blockchains like Cardano (ADA) and emerging players like Coldware (COLD). \
While Cardano has remained one of the most popular altcoins, its dominance is facing a serious challenge as  unveils its innovative PayFi ecosystem. This new approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) could shake up the market, as whales begin to shift their attention away from ADA in favor of Coldware’s promise of bigger returns.Whales Betting on Bigger Returns: The Future of Coldware’s COLD TokenAs whales begin to bet on Coldware’s ecosystem, there is growing confidence that the project could outperform ADA in terms of returns. Coldware’s presale success, already raising over $1.3 million, signals that the market is ready for this new, scalable, decentralized platform. With major institutional investors eyeing the project, the potential for a  token price increase is considerable.\
The focus on scalability, real-world applications, and decentralized finance makes Coldware a more attractive option for investors looking to maximize their returns. As the project continues to expand its ecosystem, Coldware’s market position is likely to strengthen, challenging Cardano’s dominance in the space.Coldware's PayFi Ecosystem: A New Era for Decentralized FinanceColdware (COLD) has made a bold move by launching its PayFi ecosystem — a decentralized finance platform integrated with IoT technologies. This move places Coldware at the cutting edge of blockchain innovation. The PayFi ecosystem allows users to engage in financial services, from lending to borrowing, all within a decentralized network that utilizes Coldware’s scalable blockchain.\What sets Coldware apart from Cardano (ADA) and others is its  and the integration of physical infrastructure with blockchain technology. Coldware’s ecosystem allows for decentralized applications (dApps) to interact seamlessly with IoT devices, enabling a wide range of industries to adopt blockchain solutions without relying on centralized intermediaries.\
Cardano (ADA) has long been a go-to cryptocurrency for those seeking a balance of security, scalability, and decentralization. However, its growth has often been overshadowed by market volatility and the slow pace of its development. Despite recent surges in price and widespread institutional interest, Cardano (ADA) faces a critical juncture. The question arises: can  continue to maintain its dominance, or will newer platforms like Coldware (COLD) steal the spotlight?\
The Cardano ecosystem has been relatively stable, but challenges regarding scalability and its adoption by developers are starting to emerge. The whales who were initially lured by Cardano’s promises are now on the lookout for something more scalable and efficient. Coldware’s launch of its PayFi ecosystem is set to disrupt the crypto space and could attract institutional investors who are looking for real-world applications in the decentralized finance sector.While Cardano (ADA) has built a solid foundation in the blockchain space, Coldware’s introduction of the PayFi ecosystem marks the beginning of a new era in decentralized finance. Coldware’s focus on scalability and its integration with IoT networks present a unique value proposition that could propel it ahead of ADA in the coming months. The whales’ growing interest in  token suggests that Coldware is poised to challenge ADA’s dominance.As Coldware’s PayFi ecosystem continues to gain traction, ADA’s market position faces a serious challenge. Coldware’s ability to offer scalable, real-world blockchain solutions makes it a worthy contender in the fight for decentralized finance supremacy. With whales betting on Coldware’s success and its growing ecosystem, it’s clear that  is the blockchain to watch in 2025.:::info

We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany: CDU/CSU and SPD to begin formal coalition negotiations | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KabeCezuYL8</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KabeCezuYL8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:07:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The parties negotiating Germany's next coalition government have reached an agreement in their exploratory talks, conservative bloc leader Friedrich Merz said on Saturday.

Vaughan-Nichols at The New Stack. 

"The real issue is the community's opposition to the open source AI definition (OSAID), which the organization released last October," he adds — but "the election process has been criticized because the OSI has refused to accept the candidacy of Debian developer Luke Faraone, citing a missed application deadline."
Faraone claims they submitted their application around 9 p.m. PST on Feb. 17, while the OSI maintains the deadline was 11:59 p.m. UTC (3:59 p.m. PST) on the same day. 

The dispute has raised a firestorm about the clarity of communication regarding deadlines and time zones. Critics argue that the deadline's time zone was not clearly specified on the OSI's public-facing website. Tracy Hinds, chair of OSI, acknowledged this oversight but stated that full members received multiple emails with the correct time zone information. "Everyone who is qualified to run for elections (full members of OSI) received emails with the time zone," wrote Hinds, in an email to The New Stack. "The public-facing web page did not have the time zone, and we've now updated it for clarity going forward. 

"Extending the deadline would be unfair to the other candidates...." 
On LinkedIn, Bruce Perens, one of the OSI's founders wrote, "Open Source Initiative invents rule at the last minute to deny opposition candidate's nomination for their board election." 
There are three board sets up for election in March, the article points out. "Two well-known figures in the open source world — Richard Fontana, Red Hat's principal commercial counsel and a former OSI board member, and [Bradley] Kuhn, policy fellow and hacker-in-residence at the Software Freedom Conservancy — are running on a joint platform of repealing the open source AI definition." 

In a blog post Faraone promised a similar platform (also supporting a repeal of the definition) — had their candidacy not been rejected.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wine Releases Framework Mono 6.14 In Taking Over The Mono Project</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-Framework-Mono-6.14</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 17:28:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year Microsoft donated the Mono Project to Wine for its stewardship under the WineHQ umbrella.

Three people also died and seven injured in a drone attack in the city of Bohodukhiv, in the Kharkiv region.Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukrainian cities has intensified after a torrid week in which Trump has pulled the plug on intelligence sharing with Ukraine and halted the supply of US weapons.These hostile moves mean the alarm system that warns Ukrainian civilians of incoming enemy missiles is less effective. Asked if Putin was taking advantage of US aid pauses, Trump on Friday acknowledged Ukraine was experiencing a “tremendous pounding”.He suggested, however, that “anyone in Putin’s position” would do the same. Before a meeting on Tuesday between US and Ukrainian representatives in Saudi Arabia, Trump said he was “finding it easier” to deal with Moscow than with Kyiv.European leaders suggested the US president was complicit in the latest devastation.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said there had been “another tragic night in Ukraine”, with “more bombs, more aggression and more victims”. Without mentioning Trump directly, he said: “This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians.”The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the “relentless” Russian missiles demonstrated that Putin had no interest in peace. “We must step up our military support. Otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price,” she said.Zelenskyy has been seeking to repair relations with Trump after their acrimonious White House meeting last month. Ukraine’s president has sketched out a peace plan – beginning with a truce on land and sea – and said he is ready to sign a favourable minerals deal with the US.So far, however, Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine while making no demands of Russia. Zelenskyy said Saturday’s strike showed Moscow’s objectives had not changed. He called for an increase in sanctions against Russia to “collapse” its war economy.Russia’s latest strike transformed the centre of Dobropillia into a sprawling ruin. The apartment block was a gutted mess. There were burnt-out cars and vans and smouldering debris. Rescuers swept up glass and twisted pieces of metal. Video from the strike showed a terrifying explosion.Irina Kostenko, 59, spent the night cowering in her hallway with her husband. When she left the apartment building on Saturday, she saw a neighbour “lying dead on the ground, covered with a blanket”. “It was shocking, I don’t have the words to describe it,” she told the AFP news agency.Meanwhile, Russia has exploited the US intelligence and weapons freeze to launch a series of bold attacks. North Korean and Russian troops have broken through Ukraine’s defences in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian units have for seven months occupied a parcel of territory.There were unconfirmed reports on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had managed to stabilise the situation and avoid encirclement, at least for now. A hundred Russian soldiers crept through a gas pipeline in a raid on the Kyiv-held Russian town of Sudzha, Ukrainskaya Pravda newspaper reported.Ukraine’s hold on territory in Kursk is increasingly precarious. Soldiers told the Observer two supply roads with the Ukrainian city of Sumy were open, but came under constant attack from Russian drones and artillery.Serhiy Sternenko, a prominent Ukrainian activist, described the logistics situation there as “rapidly deteriorating and already critical”. “Logistics routes to Sudzha are under full enemy fire control,” he posted on X.According to Kremlin bloggers, Russian combat groups advanced several kilometres across the border into Ukraine’s Sumy region. Russia also said it had retaken three villages in neighbouring Kharkiv oblast.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WebAssembly on Kubernetes: What You Need to Know</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/webassembly-on-kubernetes-what-you-need-to-know?source=rss</link><author>Nicolas Fränkel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 17:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like a couple of innovative technologies, different people have different viewpoints on where WebAssembly fits the technology landscape.WebAssembly (also called Wasm) is certainly the subject of much hype right now. But what is it? Is it the JavaScript Killer? Is it a new programming language for the web? Is it (as we like to say) the next wave of cloud compute? We’ve heard it called many things: a better eBPF, the alternative to RISC V, a competitor to Java (or Flash), a performance booster for browsers, a replacement for Docker.\
In this post, I'll stay away from these debates and focus solely on how to use WebAssembly on Kubernetes.My Approach and the Use CaseUnlike regular programming languages, you don't write WebAssembly directly: you write code that generates WebAssembly. At the moment, Go and Rust are the main source languages. I know Kotlin and Python are working toward this objective. There might be other languages I'm not aware of.\
I've settled on Rust for this post because of my familiarity with the language. In particular, I'll keep the same code across three different architectures:Regular Rust-to-native code as the baselineRust-to-WebAssembly using a WasmEdge embedded runtimeRust-to-WebAssembly using an external runtime\
Don't worry; I'll explain the difference between the two last approaches later.\
The use case should be more advanced than Hello World to highlight the capabilities of WebAssembly. I've implemented an HTTP server mimicking a single endpoint of the excellent httpbin API testing utility. The code itself is not essential as the post is not about Rust, but in case you're interested, you can find it on GitHub. I add a field to the response to explicitly return the underlying approach, respectively , , or .Baseline: Regular Rust-to-nativeFor the regular native compilation, I'm using a multistage Docker file:FROM rust:1.84-slim AS build                                             #1

RUN <<EOB                                                                #2
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y musl-tools musl-dev
  rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl                           #3

COPY --from=build /native/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/httpbin httpbin #6

ENTRYPOINT ["./httpbin"]
Start from the latest Rust imageInstall the necessary toolchain to cross-compileI could potentially use , but after reading this, I prefer to use distrolessCopy the executable from the previous compilation phase\
The final  image weighs 8.71M, with its base image  taking 6.03M of them.The main idea behind WebAssembly is that it's secure because it can't access the host system. However, we must open a socket to listen to incoming requests to run an HTTP server. WebAssembly can't do that. We need a runtime that provides this feature and other system-dependent capabilities. It's the goal of WebAssembly System Interface.The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a group of standards-track API specifications for software compiled to the W3C WebAssembly (Wasm) standard. WASI is designed to provide a secure standard interface for applications that can be compiled to Wasm from any language, and that may run anywhere—from browsers to clouds to embedded devices.\
The specification v0.2 defines the following system interfaces:\
A couple of runtimes already implement the specification:\
I had to choose without being an expert in any of these. I finally decided on WasmEdge because of its focus on the Cloud.\
We must intercept code that calls with system APIs and redirect them to the runtime. Instead of runtime interception, the Rust ecosystem provides a patch mechanism: we replace code that calls system APIs with code that calls WASI APIs. We must know which dependency calls which system API and hope a patch exists for our dependency version.[patch.crates-io]
tokio = { git = "https://github.com/second-state/wasi_tokio.git", branch = "v1.36.x" }  #1-2
socket2 = { git = "https://github.com/second-state/socket2.git", branch = "v0.5.x" }    #1

tokio = { version = "1.36", features = ["rt", "macros", "net", "time", "io-util"] }     #2
axum = "0.8"
serde = { version = "1.0.217", features = ["derive"] }
Patch the  and  crates with WASI-related callsThe latest  crate is 1.43, but the latest (and only) patch is v1.36. We can't use the latest version because there's no patch.\
We must change the Dockerfile to compiler WebAssembly code instead of native:FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM rust:1.84-slim AS build

RUN <<EOT bash
    set -ex
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y git clang
    rustup target add wasm32-wasip1                                      #1

WORKDIR /wasm

COPY wasm/Cargo.toml Cargo.toml

WORKDIR /

COPY src src

WORKDIR /wasm

RUN RUSTFLAGS="--cfg wasmedge --cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release <2><3>
We must activate the  flag, as well as the  one, to successfully compile to WebAssembly\
At this stage, we have two options for the second stage:Use the WasmEdge runtime as a base image:  FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM wasmedge/slim-runtime:0.13.5

  COPY --from=build /wasm/target/wasm32-wasip1/release/httpbin.wasm /httpbin.wasm

  CMD ["wasmedge", "--dir", ".:/", "/httpbin.wasm"]
\
  From a usage perspective, it's pretty similar to the native approach.Copy the WebAssembly file and make it a runtime responsibility:  FROM scratch

  COPY --from=build /wasm/target/wasm32-wasip1/release/httpbin.wasm /httpbin.wasm

  ENTRYPOINT ["/httpbin.wasm"]
\
  It's where things get interesting.\
The  approach is slightly better than the  one, but the  is the leanest since it contains only a single Webassembly file.Running the Wasm image on DockerNot all Docker runtimes are equal, and to run Wasm workloads, we need to delve a bit into the Docker name. While Docker, the company, created Docker as the product, the current reality is that containers have evolved beyond Docker and now answer to specifications.The Open Container Initiative is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.\
  Established in June 2015 by Docker and other leaders in the container industry, the OCI currently contains three specifications: the Runtime Specification (runtime-spec), the Image Specification (image-spec) and the Distribution Specification (distribution-spec). The Runtime Specification outlines how to run a “filesystem bundle” that is unpacked on disk. At a high-level an OCI implementation would download an OCI Image then unpack that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle. At this point the OCI Runtime Bundle would be run by an OCI Runtime.\
From then on, I'll use the proper terminology for OCI images and containers. Not all OCI runtimes are equal, and far from all of them can run Wasm workloads: OrbStack, my current OCI runtime, can't, but Docker Desktop can, as an  feature. As per the documentation, we must:Use  for pulling and storing images\
Finally, we can run the above OCI image containing the Wasm file by selecting a Wasm runtime, Wasmedge, in my case. Let's do it:docker run --rm -p3000:3000 --runtime=io.containerd.wasmedge.v1 ghcr.io/ajavageek/wasm-kubernetes:runtime
\
io.containerd.wasmedge.v1 is the current version of the Wasmedge runtime. You must be authenticated with GitHub if you want to try it out.curl localhost:3000/get\?foo=bar | jq
\
The result is the same as for the native version:{
  "flavor": "runtime",
  "args": {
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "headers": {
    "accept": "*/*",
    "host": "localhost:3000",
    "user-agent": "curl/8.7.1"
  },
  "url": "/get?foo=bar"
}
\
Wasi on Docker Desktop allows you to spin up an HTTP server that behaves like a regular native image! Even better, the image size is as tiny as the WebAssembly file it contains:Running the Wasm Image on KubernetesNow comes the fun part: your favorite Cloud provider(s) isn't using Docker Desktop. Despite this, we can still run WebAssembly workloads on Kubernetes. For this, we need to understand a bit about the not-too-low levels of what happens when you run a container, regardless of whether it's from an OCI runtime or Kubernetes.\
The latter executes a process; in our case, it's . Yet,  is only an orchestrator of other container processes. It detects the "flavor" of the container and calls the relevant executable. For example, for "regular" containers, it calls  via a . The good thing is that we can install other shims dedicated to other container types, such as Wasm. The following illustration, taken from  the Wasmedge website, summarizes the flow:Despite some of the mainstreamCloud providers offering Wasm integration, none of them provide such a low-level one. I'll continue on my laptop, but Docker Desktop doesn't offer a direct integration either: it's time to be creative. For example, minikube is a full-fledged Kubernetes distribution that creates an intermediate Linux virtual machine within a Docker environment. We can SSH into the VM and configure it to our heart's content. Let's start by installing .\
Now, we start  with the  driver and specify a profile to enable differently configured VMs. We unimaginatively call this profile .minikube start --driver=docker --container-runtime=containerd -p=wasm
\
Depending on whether you have already installed  and whether it has already downloaded its images, starting can take a few seconds to dozens of minutes. Be patient. The output should be something akin to:😄  [wasm] minikube v1.35.0 on Darwin 15.1.1 (arm64)

\
At this point, our goal is to install on the underlying VM:Wasmedge to run Wasm workloadsA shim to bridge between  and \
We can install Wasmedge, but I found nowhere to download the shim. In the next step, we will build both. We first need to install Rust:curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
\
The script likely complains that it can't execute the downloaded binary:Cannot execute /tmp/tmp.NXPz8utAQx/rustup-init (likely because of mounting /tmp as noexec).
Please copy the file to a location where you can execute binaries and run ./rustup-init.
\
Follow the instructions:cp /tmp/tmp.NXPz8utAQx/rustup-init .
./rustup-init
\
Proceed with the default installation by pressing the  button. When it's finished, source your current shell.\
The system is ready to build Wasmedge and the shim.sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git

git clone https://github.com/containerd/runwasi.git

cd runwasi
./scripts/setup-linux.sh

make build-wasmedge
INSTALL="sudo install" LN="sudo ln -sf" make install-wasmedge
\
The last step requires configuring the  process with the shim. Insert the following snippet in the [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes] section of the /etc/containerd/config.toml file:        [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.wasmedgev1]
          runtime_type = "io.containerd.wasmedge.v1"
\
Restart  to load the new config.sudo systemctl restart containerd
\
Our system is finally ready to accept Webassembly workloads. Users can deploy a Wasmedge  with the following manifest:apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: wasmedge                                                         #1

Wasmedge workloads should use this nameHandler to use. It should be the last segment of the section added in the TOML file, , containerd.runtimes.wasmedgev2Point to the runtime class name we defined just above\
I used a single  instead of a full-fledged  to keep things simple.\
Notice the many levels of indirection:The  refers to the  runtime class nameThe  runtime class points to the  handlerThe  handler in the TOML file specifies the io.containerd.wasmedge.v1 runtime typeTo compare the approaches and test our work, we can use the  addon and vCluster. The former offers a single access point for all three workloads, , , and , while vCluster isolates workloads from each other in their virtual cluster.\
Let's start by installing the addon:minikube -p wasm addons enable ingress
\
It deploys an Nginx Ingress Controller in the  namespace:💡  ingress is an addon maintained by Kubernetes. For any concerns contact minikube on GitHub.
You can view the list of minikube maintainers at: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/OWNERS
💡  After the addon is enabled, please run "minikube tunnel" and your ingress resources would be available at "127.0.0.1"

    ▪ Using image registry.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/kube-webhook-certgen:v1.4.4
    ▪ Using image registry.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.3
🔎  Verifying ingress addon...
🌟  The 'ingress' addon is enabled
\
We must create a dedicated virtual cluster to deploy the  later.helm upgrade --install runtime vcluster/vcluster --namespace runtime --create-namespace  --values vcluster.yaml
\
We will define the , the , and their related  in each virtual cluster. We need vCluster to synchronize the  with the Ingress Controller. Here's the configuration to achieve this:sync:

Let's request the lightweight container that uses the Wasmedge runtime:curl localhost/runtime/get\?foo=bar | jq

We get the expected output:{

  },
  "headers": {
    "user-agent": "curl/8.7.1",
    "x-forwarded-host": "localhost",

    "host": "localhost",
    "x-forwarded-port": "80"
  },
  "url": "/get?foo=bar"
}
\
We should get similar results with the other approaches, with different  values.In this post, I showed how to use Webassembly on Kubernetes with the Wasmedge runtime. I created three flavors for comparison purposes: , , and . The first two are "regular" Docker images, while the latter contains only a single Wasm file, which makes it very lightweight and secure. However, we need a dedicated runtime to run it.\
Regular managed Kubernetes services don't allow configuring an additional shim, such as the Wasmedge shim. Even on my laptop, I had to be creative to make it happen. I had to use Minikube and put much effort into configuring its intermediate virtual machine to run Wasm workloads on Kubernetes. Yet, I managed to run all three images inside their virtual cluster, exposed outside the cluster by an Nginx Ingress Controller.\
Now, it's up to you to decide whether the extra effort is worth the 10x reduction of image size and the improved security. I hope the future will improve the support so that the pros outweigh the cons.\

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.

To many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. 

The public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn’t see his family for months so as not to infect them.

When the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.

By now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aurélie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aurélie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.

As the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?

: This is a message sent to a node that queries for the data specified in the  message.\
: A  of a graph is a subset of the graph that connects all its vertices with the minimum number of edges without forming any cycles.Blockchain is gaining massive attention as support for cryptocurrencies due to the rapid growth of memecoins and the celebrated launch of cryptocurrencies. However, one key challenge in blockchain networks is the efficient propagation of messages between nodes, which leads to communication resource consumption. In traditional gossip protocol, a key problem plaguing it is the latency issue—a node must wait for the next cycle to transmit a message.\
The Plumtree algorithm is designed to reduce latency and redundancy in message transmission, particularly in peer-to-peer networks and distributed systems where reliable and fast message dissemination is important. It can achieve this by finding the shortest path to send the message to the next node in the . By doing this, each node participates in forwarding messages without relying on a central source.\
This article delves into the implementation of the Plumtree algorithm in the Solana network and its role in increasing the speed of message propagation in the network. Furthermore, a comparison between Plumtree and GossipSub, a gossip-based epidemic broadcast algorithm used in Ethereum.In Solana, a gossip-based block propagation method is as follows: when a node receives a new block, it sends a  message to other nodes in the network. This broadcast includes information about the new block, such as the block header, transaction data, state changes, and other metadata like compressed data, etc. Upon receiving the  message, the receiving node checks if it already has the block in its ledger history. When the nodes check its history and have no record of that block, it sends a  request back to the broadcasting node, querying for the block data.\
When the node receives the data of the queried block, it verifies it and adds it to the network. This ensures that the node does not share the block data with every other node in the network repeatedly.The plum is a fruit of the Prunus species, , a genus of trees that also includes peach, cherry, nectarine, almond, and apricot trees. Plums have a lot of health benefits. They contain a lot of nutrients, are rich in antioxidants, promote bone health, and help lower blood sugar. China and Romania are the two largest plum producers.The main sources of inspiration for the Plumtree algorithm are as follows:The flowering of the plum trees in the early spring.The transformation of the pollinated flowers to plums.The plums drop before maturity by 20–30% due to various reasons or diseases, such as diseases caused by plant viruses.The plums have a shelf life of around 2–6 weeks, even when they are stored at 0 °C.\
The Plumtree algorithm implements these sources of inspiration as follows: the positions of the flowers and the positions of the plums are represented as matrices; the dropping of the plums before maturity is represented by a  (FT), and the shelf life of the plums after they are collected is represented by a  (RT). The two thresholds lead to the development of three types of equations to update the positions of the flowers.Plumtree is a broadcast method that combines tree-based and gossip-based approaches to reduce redundancy while maintaining high message reliability. In a tree-based broadcast, each node transmits and improves efficiency by forwarding messages only in a tree-based manner. It also uses gossip-based links between nodes to properly handle inter-node failures.\
In a tree-based broadcast, a tree consisting of all participant nodes is constructed, and messages are transmitted only along the tree, which reduces the redundancy of messages. However, if the number of nodes increases or decreases or if a network failure occurs, the tree becomes incomplete, and a message may not reach all nodes. For instance, the block is broadcasted, and a  is constructed using the Plumtree algorithm. In subsequent broadcasts, the constructed tree is used. If the exchange of  and  messages is omitted, the blocks are not sent directly to the child nodes of the tree and hence fail.In Gossip-based broadcast, when a node attempts to broadcast a message, the node randomly selects nodes to send the message. The node that receives the message for the first time repeats this process to send the message, which not only provides high scalability but also makes the system more resistant to network inadequacies and node failures. \
For instance, when a node broadcasts a message, it randomly chooses a node to send it to. The node that receives the message for the first time repeats this process. This property allows the system to respond flexibly to network failures and increases or decreases in the number of nodes.\
The following approaches are utilized in the Gossip-based broadcast to disseminate data:: In this approach, once a message is received, it is sent to the neighboring nodes immediately.: In this approach, when a node receives a message, it sends the message identifier to the neighboring nodes. If the node has not received the message, it makes a pull request to the neighboring nodes.: Once a node has not received a message, it makes a query to its neighboring nodes— on recently received messages to update its state with that particular message.\
Plumtree uses a combination of an Eager push mechanism for sending a small number of messages and a Lazy push mechanism for assisting transmission.Solana utilizes a peer-to-peer communication approach combined with a Plumtree tree-inspired algorithm, allowing for efficient dissemination of data throughout the network of nodes without depending on a central source. This structure enables messages within the network to be disseminated hierarchically, with nodes directly interacting and making each node in the network operate autonomously in relaying messages to the subsequent node in the tree.A spanning tree structure is constructed using the Plumtree algorithm for the nodes in the Solana network, allowing for a more scalable approach to broadcasting information throughout the network. In basic terms, every node shares messages with its direct neighbors, who in turn, propagate the information across the spanning tree.The differences between the Plumtree algorithm and GossipSub used for information broadcasting in Solana and Ethereum, respectively, include:Solana Tree-based PTA uses a  approach where nodes are connected in a hierarchical manner where the parent node is connected to the child node. The focus is on building an optimal routing path over time through message duplication handling, while GossipSub utilizes , where nodes subscribe to specific topics related to validator duties and communication within the Ethereum network. These overlays self-optimize to find the shortest path for message dissemination.Solana Tree-based PTA uses  but focuses on handling message redundancy by downgrading peers with suboptimal message paths, while in GossipSub, messages are disseminated via a random epidemic broadcast.In this article, we examined the Plumtree algorithm in Solana's Gossip Protocol, highlighting its tree-based and gossip-based approach to efficient message dissemination. We also compared it with Ethereum’s GossipSub, noting its differences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A definitive list of open source</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1j6kz8p/a_definitive_list_of_open_source/</link><author>/u/ConsistentCan4633</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:36:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Self Hosted</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I've been building this list of definitive opensource software and I'm super proud of it so far - it serves as a single centralized location for the best of opensource, a lot of which are self hosted.Why I made it: Over the last couple months I've had this sudden obsession with replacing everything proprietary with opensource. After hundreds of hours over months of searching I finally settled on around 80 opensource apps. What I realized though was that almost all the apps I went with were found through Reddit posts, google searches, or just random sources across the web.All the GitHub Awesome Lists I went through didn't even include a lot of the "best" and most popular OSS projects out there and were instead filled with smaller projects - a lot of which were abandoned. I have yet to find any resource that serves as a centralized location for the best of opensource - and that's what this list aims to be. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Massive rallies in South Korea as Seoul divided over Yoon&apos;s impeachment</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9SnmNXvMA</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Oy9SnmNXvMA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:36:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Massive rallies in support and against South Korea's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol divided the heart of the country's capital on Saturday.

 Android Authority reports:

"Rayhunter" uses an open-source software package designed to look for evidence of IMSI catchers in action, running on an old Orbic Speed RC400L mobile hotspot. The great thing about that choice is that you can pick one up for practically nothing — we're seeing them listed for barely over $10 on Amazon, and you can find them even cheaper on eBay. There's an installation script for Macs and Linux to automate getting set up, but once the Orbic is flashed with the Rayhunter software, it should be ready go, collecting data about sketchy-looking "cell towers" it picks up. 

Right now, much of the use of IMSI catchers is still shrouded in mystery, with the groups who regularly employ them extremely hesitant to disclose their methods. As a result, a big focus of this EFF project is just getting more info on how and where these are actually used, giving protestors a better sense of the steps they'll need to take if they want to protect their privacy.

But real-time perception is tough when your model is drowning in millions of LiDAR points and high-res images. The solution? Sensor fusion, model quantization, and a sprinkle of TensorRT acceleration.Let me walk you through how I optimized a multi-modal perception model to run 40% faster while keeping it sharp enough to dodge pedestrians and parked cars.The Bottleneck: A Million Points, A Million ProblemsAutonomous vehicles rely on , each with strengths and weaknesses. LiDAR excels at , but it spits out millions of points per second. Cameras provide  but lack depth. Fusing both in a single pipeline means balancing .Problem 1: The Lag Between LiDAR and Camera DataBy the time LiDAR finishes scanning, the camera has already captured a new frame. This misalignment means object positions don’t match. I used  with  to adjust LiDAR points dynamically. Here’s a snippet of how it works in Python:import numpy as np

class EgoMotionCompensation:
    def __init__(self, initial_pose, process_noise, measurement_noise):
        self.state = initial_pose  
        self.P = np.eye(5) * 0.01
        self.Q = np.diag(process_noise)
        self.R = np.diag(measurement_noise)

    def predict(self, dt):
        # Unpack state
        x, y, yaw, vx, vy = self.state
        x_pred = x + vx * dt
        y_pred = y + vy * dt
        yaw_pred = yaw 
        self.state = np.array([x_pred, y_pred, yaw_pred, vx, vy])
        F = np.eye(5)
        F[0, 3] = dt
        F[1, 4] = dt
        self.P = F @ self.P @ F.T + self.Q

    def update(self, measurement):
        #measurement = [x_meas, y_meas, yaw_meas]
        H = np.array([
            [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
        ])
        z = np.array(measurement)
        y_err = z - H @ self.state
        S = H @ self.P @ H.T + self.R
        K = self.P @ H.T @ np.linalg.inv(S)
        self.state += K @ y_err
        I = np.eye(5)
        self.P = (I - K @ H) @ self.P

    def apply_correction(self, lidar_points, dt):
        #predict and update using IMU/odometry
        self.predict(dt)
        #Suppose we have a measurement from the IMU or odometry
        #assume partial measurement [x_meas, y_meas, yaw_meas]
        measurement = [self.state[0], self.state[1], self.state[2]]
        self.update(measurement)

        x, y, yaw, _, _ = self.state
        cos_yaw, sin_yaw = np.cos(yaw), np.sin(yaw)
        transformed = []
        for px, py, pz in lidar_points:
            #rotate and translate
            x_new = (px * cos_yaw - py * sin_yaw) + x
            y_new = (px * sin_yaw + py * cos_yaw) + y
            transformed.append((x_new, y_new, pz))
        return np.array(transformed)
This tweak reduced misalignment by 85%, boosting object detection accuracy.Problem 2: Sensor Fusion: Making LiDAR and Cameras Play NiceNow that we fixed the time lag, we have another issue: LiDAR gives , while cameras provide . We needed a  for both.\
We built a Bird’s Eye View (BEV) model that projects LiDAR points onto the image plane and aligns them with camera pixels.Calibrated LiDAR and camera with intrinsic & extrinsic matrices. into the image space. using a cross-attention transformer.\
Here’s how the projection works in Python:import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import cv2
import numpy as np

def voxelize_points(lidar_points, voxel_size=(0.1, 0.1, 0.2)):
    #Transform LiDAR points into 3D voxel indices
    coords = np.floor(lidar_points / np.array(voxel_size)).astype(int)
    coords -= coords.min(0)
    voxels = np.zeros((coords[:,0].max()+1, coords[:,1].max()+1, coords[:,2].max()+1))
    for (x_idx, y_idx, z_idx) in coords:
        voxels[x_idx, y_idx, z_idx] += 1
    return voxels

def project_voxel_to_image(voxel_coords, camera_matrix, rvec, tvec, voxel_size):
    """
    Projects 3D voxel centers into image space using a known camera matrix (including distortion).
    """
    #compute center for each voxel
    voxel_centers = []
    for (x_idx, y_idx, z_idx) in voxel_coords:
        center_x = x_idx * voxel_size[0]
        center_y = y_idx * voxel_size[1]
        center_z = z_idx * voxel_size[2]
        voxel_centers.append([center_x, center_y, center_z])

    voxel_centers = np.array(voxel_centers, dtype=np.float32).reshape(-1, 1, 3)
    #project to image plane
    img_pts, _ = cv2.projectPoints(voxel_centers, rvec, tvec, camera_matrix, None)
    return img_pts

def fuse_features(camera_features, lidar_features):
    """
    cross-attention: queries come from camera_features,
    keys/values from lidar_features, to refine camera representation
    based on 3D data.
    """
    #camera_features, lidar_features are [Batch, Channels, Height, Width]
    fused = torch.cat([camera_features, lidar_features], dim=1)
    fused = F.relu(F.conv2d(fused, torch.randn(128, fused.size(1), 3, 3)))
    return fused
This improved detection by 29%, helping the model understand its surroundings better.Slashing Inference Time by 40% With TensorRT and QuantizationEven with better fusion, inference time was killing us. Running deep learning models on embedded hardware isn’t the same as cloud GPUs. We needed to shrink the model without losing accuracy.The Solution: TensorRT + QuantizationConverted PyTorch to TensorRT: TensorRT optimizes computation graphs, fuses layers, and reduces memory overhead.Applied INT8 Quantization: This compressed 32-bit floating points into  making computations .\
Quantization technique that was used:import torch
from torch.ao.quantization import (
    get_default_qconfig_mapping,
    prepare_fx,
    convert_fx
)

def apply_quantization(model, calibration_data):
    model.eval()

    #Use a QConfigMapping that sets INT8 or mixed precision
    qconfig_mapping = get_default_qconfig_mapping("fbgemm")
    example_inputs = (calibration_data[0].unsqueeze(0), calibration_data[1].unsqueeze(0))
    prepared_model = prepare_fx(model, qconfig_mapping, example_inputs)

    #Run calibration
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in calibration_data:
            fused_input = data[0].unsqueeze(0), data[1].unsqueeze(0)
            prepared_model(*fused_input)

    quantized_model = convert_fx(prepared_model)
    return quantized_model
\
An example of how I converted the PyTorch model:import tensorrt as trt
import os

def build_tensorrt_engine(onnx_file_path, precision="int8", max_batch_size=4, input_shape=(3, 256, 256)):

    builder = trt.Builder(trt_logger)
    network_flags = 1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH)
    network = builder.create_network(flags=network_flags)
    parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, trt_logger)

    if not os.path.exists(onnx_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"ONNX file not found: {onnx_file_path}")

    with open(onnx_file_path, "rb") as f:
        if not parser.parse(f.read()):
            for i in range(parser.num_errors):
                print(parser.get_error(i))
            raise ValueError("Failed to parse the ONNX file.")

    config = builder.create_builder_config()
    if precision == "int8":
        config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.INT8)
    elif precision == "fp16":
        config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.FP16)

    profile = builder.create_optimization_profile()
    #define min/opt/max batch sizes
    min_shape = (1,) + input_shape
    opt_shape = (max_batch_size // 2,) + input_shape
    max_shape = (max_batch_size,) + input_shape

    input_name = network.get_input(0).name
    profile.set_shape(input_name, min_shape, opt_shape, max_shape)
    config.add_optimization_profile(profile)

    engine = builder.build_engine(network, config)
    return engine
Inference time dropped from 250ms → 75ms per frame.Memory footprint reduced by 40%.Real-time performance improved to 5 FPS.Next Steps: End-to-End LearningWe’re still exploring , where perception and planning happen in one deep learning pipeline. The idea? Instead of multiple modules for object detection, lane estimation, and path planning, we let a neural network learn everything from scratch.\
Some early results show promise but training needs massive datasets and interpretability is a challenge. Still, we’re inching toward fully AI-driven navigation.Final Thoughts: AI That Sees and Thinks FastBy blending sensor fusion, ego-motion correction, and TensorRT acceleration, we made autonomous AI . \

Comedian and voice actor George Lowe, who is well-known as the voice of Space Ghost on "Space Ghost Coast to Coast," died on March 2. He was 67... 
He did some voice-over work for TBWS and Cartoon Network in the 1980s to mid-1990s before getting his lead role of Space Ghost in 1994 with the premiere of "Space Ghost Coast to Coast" on Cartoon Network. Space Ghost was a parody of talk shows with live-action celebrity guests, hosted by the Hanna Barbera character Space Ghost, which aired from 1994 to 1999 on Cartoon Network. The show later returned in 2001, airing on Adult Swim's late-night programming block until 2004, Deadline reported. 

When animation pioneer William Hanna died in 2001, Slashdot founder CmdrTaco posted "the thing that I respect most about Hanna is the fact that a show like Space Ghost Coast to Coast was allowed to take their characters and do something truly unique with them. He even lent his voice to the show in one episode. Not a lot of people would be willing to allow one of their creations to be twisted like that, but the original Space Ghost was one of my childhood staples, and Space Ghost Coast to Coast stands in a class all its own proving that creativity isn't dead on TV." 

"Adult Swim would not be the network it is today without Space Ghost Coast to Coast," argues ComicBook.com. (And as a tribute to Lowe, Adult Swim posted five minutes of surreal outtakes from Space Ghost Coast to Coast's 10th Anniversary celebration.) 


A headline at Vulture.com makes the case that "Space Ghost Coast to Coast Only Worked Because of George Lowe." They've rounded up a collection of videos with surreal titles like "Marrying Bjork" and "Guesting on a MF DOOM track" (plus that time Lowe did a live interview — in his Space Ghost costume — with C-SPAN).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to invest $10,000 with Blue Owl&apos;s Lipschultz #business #stocks #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr7tynioXEQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dr7tynioXEQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 15:30:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Blue Owl Capital Co-CEO Marc Lipschultz tells us what he would do with $10k and more at #BloombergInvest.

A score of 100 percent would mean full equality with men. African women are a long way from that.
 
In 2023, African women scored just over 50 percent — so only halfway to complete gender equality across economic, social, and public leadership areas. It is a sobering statistic that shows only a slight improvement from 48.6 percent in 2019.
 
But there is some light in the darkness: Namibia, the highest-ranking country in the continent, scores 88 percent. The report calls it 'the African champion of gender equality'. Tiny Lesotho, a gender equality giant, scores 82 percent. Its constitution guarantees equal pay for women and men. And Rwanda scores almost 80 percent — The report says it has a 'strong political will for gender equality'. That might have something to do with the fact that 61 percent of Rwanda's elected representatives are women.
 
But elsewhere, the landscape is less promising. In regard to the extent to which men and women participate equally in decision-making in politics, government and business, things have improved slightly but that rate is so slow, it would take until 2063 for African women to achieve full equality.

Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) software is leading the car industry’s push to automation.Mr Musk is banking on autonomous driving being the next source of growth as Tesla’s sales decline amid a political backlash over his support for Donald Trump.The Tesla chief, who has frequently clashed with Sir Keir Starmer in recent months, has said that autonomy will be the “main driver” of value. Tesla shares have fallen by almost a third this year as it faces sales declines in many of its key markets.Tesla’s top lobbyist in Europe left the company in October, hitting out at the slow process that means the technology – introduced in the US in 2020 – may not make it to Europe until 2028.Minutes from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) – the body that decides new safety rules for vehicles – show that DfT officials raised concerns about plans to approve wide-ranging driver assistance systems.As originally drafted, the plans would have allowed vehicles to make manoeuvres such as lane changes, junction turns and stopping and starting at traffic lights while motorists had their hands off the wheel.However, the changes have now been watered down to restrict the systems to “highway” moves such as lane switching and to require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel.In September, UK officials proposed the restrictions, saying: “Introducing system-initiated manoeuvres is a significant step which entails a degree of unknown.“Whilst [a driver assistance system] may help in reducing collisions, it may also introduce new safety risks.”They said the technology should instead be introduced “in phases”.In January, officials in the UK, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands put out a request for further evidence on the safety of driver assistance systems, saying: “The technological advancements in these systems are promising, but there remain concerns about their impact on driver behaviour, situational awareness and overall safety.”The changes mean that only a basic version of systems such as Tesla’s FSD are likely to be deployed in the UK and Europe over the next year.Marc Van Impe, Tesla’s former head of safety policy, who had overseen discussions on the changes, left the company for Mr Musk’s SpaceX in October, saying that the slow process “impacts Europe’s competitiveness”.Tesla has sold “full self-driving capability” as a paid-for upgrade since 2016, and currently charges £6,800 for the feature in Britain, although it has no practical use.The company said last year it hoped to introduce full self-driving features in Europe during the first quarter of 2025, although Mr Musk recently conceded that was unlikely.“Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed,” he told investors in January, saying he was unsure whether Tesla would be able to release the system this year.The company could seek an exemption to the regulations. Drivers of Ford’s Mustang Mach-E are able to take their hands off the wheel on motorways in the UK after the company secured an exemption in 2023.Thousands of drivers in the US are using the FSD system and Mr Musk has said he hopes the cars will be able to drive “unsupervised” this year, a step to launching a robotaxi business.Last year, he unveiled a “cybercab” with no pedals, steering wheel or mirrors which Tesla hopes to start making in 2027.Despite Tesla branding the system as “full self-driving”, driver assistance technologies such as FSD are legally different from self-driving systems, where the liability would fall on the company behind the system, rather than the driver.A DfT spokesman said: “The UK has some of the safest roads in the world. With 88pc of all recorded road accidents currently involving human error, advanced driver assistant technology could play a crucial role in reducing accidents and saving lives.“Road safety is our absolute priority, and that’s why we’re working closely with other countries to ensure these new technologies are safe, while harnessing the potential of autonomous vehicle technology to create jobs, power growth and help us deliver our Plan for Change.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

It is estimated that around 10 women and girls are killed every day by intimate partners or other family members. 

Another alarming statistic is the impunity rate of these crimes. Only 2% of cases end in a criminal sentence and only one in 10 victims dares to report their aggressor.

It's initially available on Pixel devices running Android 15 but will be expanded to "all sufficiently robust Android phones" when Android 16 arrives later this year," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: Today, Linux is only available on the latest Pixel devices running Android 15. When Android 16 arrives later this year, it's expected that all sufficiently robust Android phones will be able to run Linux. Besides a Linux terminal, beta tests have already shown that you should be able to run desktop Linux programs from your phone -- games like Doom, for example. The Linux Terminal runs on top of a Debian Linux virtual machine. This enables you to access a shell interface directly on your Android device. And that just scratches the surface of Google's Linux Terminal. It's actually a do-it-all app that enables you to download, configure, and run Debian. Underneath Terminal runs the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). These are the APIs that enable Android devices to run other operating systems.
 
To try the Linux Terminal app, you must activate Developer Mode by navigating to Settings - About Phone and tapping the build number seven times. I guess Google wants to make sure you want to do this. Once Developer Mode is enabled, the app can be activated via Settings - System - Developer options - Linux development environment. The initial setup may take a while because it needs to download Debian. Typically this is a 500MB download. Once in place, it allows you to adjust disk space allocation, set port controls for network communication, and recover the virtual machine's storage partition. However, it currently lacks support for graphical user interface (GUI) applications. For that, we'll need to wait for Android 16.
 
According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, 'Google wants to turn Android into a proper desktop operating system, and in order to do that, it has to make it work better with traditional PC input methods and display options. Therefore, Google is now testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The DOJ still wants Google to sell off Chrome</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/</link><author>hydrolox</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:57:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The proposal, filed Friday afternoon, says that Google must “promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary to successfully complete the divestiture, to a buyer approved by the Plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to terms that the Court and Plaintiffs approve.” It also would require Google to stop paying partners for preferential treatment of its search engine.The DOJ also demands that Google provide prior notification of any new joint venture, collaboration, or partnership with any company that competes with Google in search or in search text ads. However, the company no longer has to divest its artificial intelligence investments, which was part of an initial set of recommendations issued by the plaintiffs last November. The company would still be required to give prior notification of future AI investments.“Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,” the DOJ statement accompanying the filing claims. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins.”The DOJ formally brought its case against Google back in 2020, the most significant tech antitrust case since the DOJ’s years-long battle against Microsoft in the 1990s. The lawsuit alleged that Google has used anticompetitive tactics to protect its search dominance and forge contracts that ensure it’s the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones. Because of its hold on search, the lawsuit claimed, Google can adjust the auction system through which it sells ads and increase prices for advertisers, and rake in more revenue from that.Google has argued that its overwhelming success in search—it has a nearly 90 percent share in the US market—stems from the company offering the best search technology. It also says consumers are easily able to change their default search engine, and that Google does face competition from Microsoft and others.“DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security,” said Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels in an emailed statement.Much of the ruling centered on the contracts Google has with device makers and browser partners, which use Google as their default search technology. According to Mehta’s ruling, around 70 percent of search queries in the US happen through portals in which Google is the default search engine. Google then shares revenues with those partners, paying out billions of dollars to them, which disincentivizes smaller search rivals who can’t compete with those contracts, Mehta said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Honest AI</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1j6gj0m/honest_ai/</link><author>/u/Fabulous_Bluebird931</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:52:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpt/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - ChatGPT</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discworld Rules</title><link>https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/discworld-rules</link><author>jger15</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:48:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chiang’s LawThis is no way for a high-agency technological species to live, and thankfully it doesn’t have to be.hyperstitional theory-fictionsNo, you have to tell different sorts of stories altogether.as an allegory for technology and society, The rest of humanity, thankfully, has more imaginative and generative models of reality to draw on. You just have to learn to look past the wizards, dragons, elves, and such. There is even a “Science of Discworld” meta-series to help with that.The irony is not subtle. It’s in-your-face. For instance, the core world-building premise is that of a literal “flat earth” disc-shaped planet, resting on the back of four elephants that stand on the back of a giant turtle swimming through space. But this parody of the cosmologies of antiquity is put through its paces with deadpan faux-scientific earnestness. There’s an entire novel about how there was once a fifth elephant, whose fossilized remains are the basis of the fossil fuel industry of Discworld.And it only gets sillier from there.I have a rule-of-thumb: The more seriously you take Discworld, the smarter you get about Roundworld.The silliness is a feature, not a bug. Our universe is a vast, crazy place, and we haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of the endless weirdness it harbors. As Douglas Adams noted, “If life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.” Discworld is about curing yourself of the allure of a “sense of proportion.” There is no surer of way of becoming detached from reality and addicted to some notion of manufactured normalcy.Revealingly, Roundworld isn’t even modeled in the Middle Earth cosmology, except via vaguely racist and lazy allusions (In Middle Earth, I’m presumably one of those turbaned men-from-the-east riding an Oliphaunt and uncritically allied with Sauron). If you double down on the LOTR brainrot, and add things like Ayn Rand and Rene Girard to the soup, you get a profoundly stupid vision of the world that it takes real genius to buy into. Which is what, as it happens, a lot of real geniuses (and I don’t mean this snarkily — Peter Thiel is a legit genius who happens to have bought into a really stupid vision of the world) have in fact done as of 2025, as they try to meme a revanchist Great Power world back into existence.I’ve thought about this a lot in the last few months, and I’ve concluded the whole program is in fact exactly as stupid as it sounds, and will fail in profoundly stupid ways, doing a lot of irreversible damage (Brexit was a small scale model of what’s in store for us here in the US). But to some extent I’ve made my peace with what’s coming, and have no desire to convince you that this is where things are headed. If you’ve bought into that, have fun being miserable in Middle Earth.Instead, I want to sketch out for you how you can truly learn to think in pluralist there-are-many-alternatives ways.The place to start is with the rules of Discworld.from WikipediaPeople who think they are Special and Chosen are dangerous and bad for the world.Wikipedia entrycarrier-bagDiscworld is essentially a kind place though, so the antagonists are usually just contained and neutralized, and sometimes even redeemed. They’re not vengefully made an example of by protagonists. That’s a Chosen One move. Discworlders are kinder, even if it costs them. That’s a point we’ll say more about.The Rincewind stories are one of four major sequences in the Discworld universe. These are:Sam VimesDeathI like this as acerbic commentary on the longevity fetish and Eternalism of the Tech Right. I have no issues with individuals simply making an extreme sport of literally trying to live as long as possible. Bryan Johnson is a friend and occasional client of mine, and Vitalik Buterin, whom I have interactions with through my protocols work, is also a longevity maven. At more regular-people level, friends of this newsletter like Sarah Constantin are into longevity. thar be ossified Asimovian spacer worldsas part of a Chosen One script I prefer a world run by ordinary mortals who have embraced both their ordinariness and mortality.While most core Discworld characters are either mediocre anti-heroes or parodied Chosen One antagonists, there is a big supporting cast of colorful characters who are neither, but not NPCs either. be at the mercy of the gods There is also an array of occasional antagonists who periodically show up with grand Thielean “determinate optimism” type plans, convinced they know better than average shmucks, and threatening the freedom of Discworld for its own good. These last named are perhaps the closest thing Discworld has to unredeemed and unredeemable villains. Discworld wiki[Elves] are not native to the Disc, but come from a "parasite universe", sometimes called Fairyland. This pocket dimension can latch onto different universes at certain times… …Elves have no proper imagination or real emotions, and therefore such things fascinate them. Because they cannot create they steal musicians and artists. Because they cannot have children (although they are capable of breeding with humans, resulting in offspring with superficially elvish characteristics - skinny, pointy ears, a tendency to giggle and burn easily in the sun - but fundamentally human traits i.e. empathy) they steal children from the Disc to be their toys. Because they cannot feel empathy they enjoy the suffering of others. Even if an elf is, for reasons of its own, trying to be nice, its lack of understanding of humans mean there's always something "off" about it.Mostly they get away with this, due to the illusion-creating glamour they cast. While elves are, as mentioned above, not musical, elfsong is perceived as beautiful by humans, and is highly hypnotic. Elves are generally seen as innately beautiful and stylish, but this is just another aspect of the glamour. Some of them are only vaguely humanoid.At one point, the elves migrate to Roundworld and cause havoc there, by killing the narrative vigor of history with their empty and superficial illusions, until Discworlders save the day. I like to pretend this actually happened.Everything satirized and parodied in Discworld, all the ironically deployed tropes of fantasy, are accounted for as the workings of narrativium. That means in-world, all the effects of narrativium are made fun of, but not treated as existential threats. Within the meta-story of Discworld, narrativium adds some of the coherence and discipline that the Auditors of Reality yearn for, but not in a deadening, joyless way. Narrativium is life-affirming narrative irony embodied and embraced.The essential property of Narrativium is that it ensures that the history of Discworld will unfold in satisfying ways that make it a good story. This property is most on display in the fifth major sequence of novels in the map: the Industrial Revolution sequence, which feature one of the most interesting characters, Moist Von Lipwig, who is Vetinari’s fixer, nudging technological progress along.The details of these developments usually feature absurd (and absurdly entertaining) twists on the corresponding Roundworld historical events, while largely staying true to the logic of Roundworld history. For example, film technology on Discworld relies on some faux-science built around small goblins who sit in the cameras painting really fast (magical, but in an inconsequential way).And it’s all very satisfying, in ways the corresponding histories on Roundworld are not. The story also feels a lot more forcefully inevitable and necessary, but not in a restrictive or totalizing way. It is intensified rather than revisionist Roundworld history. That’s what makes narrativium good to have around.This process is one of generative discovery and continuously improvised contingency. The rule that governs this evolutionary process on Discworld, in Pratchett’s own words, is “Our minds make stories, and stories make our minds.”This is the Pratchett version of “hyperstitional theory fiction” which applies with much greater force in Discworld, such that far more consequential things can be memed into existence. In the most extreme case, as we’ve seen, the gods of Discworld themselves are memed into existence by belief, like over-powered versions of the subjects of Roundworld cults of personality. Roundworld religions, thankfully, don’t have this kind of power to create Roundworld gods of equal substance, since unlike the retiring and lazy Discworld gods, we tend to imagine very interventionist and opinionated gods for ourselves.as part of an extended seriesnarratives tell archetypes how to evolve, archetypes tell narratives how to curve.Roundworld, sadly, does not have more than trace quantities of narrativium, which is why Roundworld histories are often so unsatisfying and so easily fall prey to Discworld elves, or humans possessed by them.what does Discworld want?The sentiment behind the aspiration is perhaps a mark of British culture at its best. The high conceit of Discworld is that the infinite game always prevails and cannot truly be derailed by even by the most powerful forces. The mediocre efforts of ordinary characters powered by narrativium is enough to keep the infinite game going.always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. The history of Roundworld in recent centuries has, at least empirically, exhibited such tendencies, but unlike the denizens of Discworld, we cannot trust in that being the intrinsic nature of our world. Certainly those currently in power are trying to prove it isn’t.greater generativity and complexity and more alternatives.Or to put it another way, Discworld has an astounding, unbreakable resistance to Chosen Ones at any scale except the scale of the world itself. Discworld is powered by the anthropic principle on steroids. It keeps discovering new ways in which its entire reality is special.This is one reason Discworld can afford to be such a kind world. As a world that is intrinsically pre-disposed to reject totalizing narratives and protect multiple possibilities in an ever-expanding garden of forking paths, reality is on the side of pluralism and against totalizing conceits.This is why, on Discworld, even the weakest, most mediocre protagonists, when going up against a powerful Chosen One who wants to capture and enslave reality, can afford to be gracious. Even when they are at the lowest, and cowering before a Chosen One who thinks he has won. Because thanks to the narrativium levels in the environment, the protagonists know they will win, and need never despair. The Discworld protagonist seems to know that though they must always scramble comically and improvise energetically to save it from the monstrous Chosen One of the Week, the arc of their moral universe bends in their favor. Discworld is a world that knows what it wants, and how to get it. With some nudging along by Vetinari, Death, and Time Monks, and a lot of reluctant anti-heroic adventuring by the likes of Rincewind, Vimes, Granny Weatherwax, and Moist von Lipwig. Narrativium helps those who help themselves. Unlike Discworld, our own Roundworld has no such specific disposition. The ideas that the arc of moral history on Roundworld bends towards justice, or that “reality” has a well-known liberal bias (a comforting premise of the late-lamented hyperstitional theory fiction of traditional American politics known as “normalcy”) that are popular with us are no more than thin, wishful fictions. Probably planted in our heads by the Discworld elves.Roundworld does not want anything in particular, and no future is necessary. As Discworld scientists have discovered on their trips here, life and civilization have evolved and been destroyed multiple times on Roundworld, in a meaningless process of fragile evolution.Because kindness is worth it for its own sake, even if Roundworld lacks the narrativium leverage to turn it into a world-protecting force.The idea that there are many alternatives is the second most politically loaded one I’ve ever put out, after the idea that with the right technological scaffolding, a proper reckoning with history is in fact possible and desirable, and not necessarily an exercise in bad-faith book-keeping of resentments and grievances. BloodcoinCivilizational HypercomplexityBut at least we’re exploring many alternatives for the moment and not locking into one. And at least the value of real attempts to reckon with history, of the sort I gesture at in the Bloodcoin talk, is becoming crystal clear, given the barrage of wild and transparently motivated confabulations we are now enduring. a noteIf you want peace, prepare for war. If you want war, prepare for peace.If you want the benefits of war without the costs of peace, lie through your teeth about everythingVetinari, incidentally, did not believe the popular first epigram; he thought the truth was more banal — If you want peace, prepare for peace, if you want war, prepare for war. But I think he would agree with my second thought. Whatever the causal pattern linking war and peace, it is clear that those possessed by elves (or Auditors of Reality) lie through their teeth about everything to justify doing whatever they please, as Chosen Ones.Should you live by Discworld rules of kindness and grace, when all that might get you is contempt and destruction? Or should you tell yourself stories that make your mind of sterner stuff? The Culture is a galactic-scale post-scarcity anarcho-capitalist mongrel utopia under the benevolent protection of superintelligent spaceships. The closest fully realized fictional universe to that meme about fully automated luxury gay space communism.The Culture’s AIs and drones have no compunctions about killing and destruction — this is no gentle Three Laws of Robotics Asimovian universe. In fact, the series opens in the aftermath of a bloody war between the Culture and a peer civilization.In the Culture, what is a natural property of reality in Discworld is enforced with extreme prejudice and violence. The entirety of the Culture is like an Assassin’s Guild, with the agents and minds of Special Circumstances acting collectively like a much more forceful Vetinari. While life inside the Culture is something like a high-abundance version of an Ursula Le Guin style peaceful anarchy, its actions in foreign space resemble those of the CIA and KGB at the height of the Cold War, rolled into one. Fomenting revolutions, deposing leaders, assassinations — the whole shebang.Should we play by Discworld Rules or Culture Rules in the coming years? Should we try to become strong before choosing to be kind, or should we choose kindness whether or not we happen to be strong or weak at any given time?I don’t know, but I like that I have at least two good alternatives to ponder. That is the power of not being tied to one narrative with no alternatives being admissible. I may never end up choosing, but I think either set of rules would be better than LOTR rules.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Canada is jailing more Indigenous people</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvkQXrpmNcU</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AvkQXrpmNcU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:35:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau entered office nearly 10 years ago pledging "a total renewal of the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples" — including eliminating the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody. 
 
Now, with Trudeau set to step down, those disparities have widened further. Indigenous people, who make up about 5% of Canada's population, account for 34% of Canadians under long-term supervision orders.
 
One of them is Marvin Starblanket, a member of the Mistawasis First Nation who was released from prison two and a half years ago. Correctional Service of Canada rules still govern his life.

Soon after the aerial attacks, Trump said Vladimir Putin was “doing what anybody would do”.Overnight strikes in eastern Ukraine on Saturday killed at least 14 people and wounded dozen more, including five children.Wallace, who was the defence secretary when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, said on Saturday that Trump was diminishing the hope of Ukraine with his actions.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Hope is the most important thing in this type of conflict and, at the moment, Donald Trump is suffocating the hope that Putin can be either fought to a standstill or indeed brought to the table.”He added: “Hope is always the key for both morale and a military campaign. When this started three years ago, I remember gathering the military officials in my then department, and saying on day one, we have to give the Ukrainians hope.“If a Russian truck has a puncture, we need to let people know. If the Russians have a small defeat, we need to let the Ukrainian people know.”Wallace suggested that Ukraine could still win the war if it continued holding off Russian forces. He said: “If Ukraine continues to resist for 18 months, the Russian economy will collapse. Its inflation rate’s at 23%, it’s spending 40% of its money [on defence], it’s finding it incredibly hard to replace its equipment. It can use North Koreans like cannon fodder, but fundamentally, it is not in a good place.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Ukraine is not trying to invade Russia and go all the way to Moscow. Ukraine is trying to defend its sovereignty and its land and there is hope for them. If we were to all step up, either substitute what the Americans have taken away, or indeed show proper European resolve, and in that I include the United Kingdom, that we ain’t going anywhere.”Leaders in Europe have convened in the past week in response to Washington’s change in stance on the war. Keir Starmer said Europe is “at a crossroads in history” and confirmed that the UK and France would lead a “coalition of the willing” to help end the fighting.On Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that “the only imperial power that I see today in Europe is Russia” and called Vladimir Putin “an imperialist who seeks to rewrite history” after the Russian president appeared to compare him to Napoleon Bonaparte.Wallace said: “I’ve seen good leadership from both Keir Starmer and President Macron on this and they should both be congratulated.“What I’m hoping they’re all doing right now behind the scenes is working out what the Americans have switched off, and finding European sources, or even further afield, to replace it.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coldware Enters the Memecoin Wars</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/coldware-enters-the-memecoin-wars?source=rss</link><author>Coldware</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:19:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market is always shifting, and recent developments show that Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are beginning to cut their losses and look for better opportunities.\
As we move further into 2025, Dogecoin (DOGE)—once the darling of meme coins—is facing increasing competition from emerging projects like . While DOGE holders have profited handsomely during its hype cycles, the new wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) is calling, and many are turning their attention to Coldware (COLD) for more substantial, long-term gains.Coldware (COLD): A DeFi Diamond Emerging in 2025On one hand, there is a fair chance that Dogecoin (DOGE) will get all the limelight from here; conversely, Coldware (COLD) would like to position itself as a true DeFi diamond come the year 2025.\
With a deep commitment to decentralized finance, Coldware (COLD) provides investors with a fine opportunity to participate in secure, scalable, and functional financial solutions, to say somewhat more under the sun than just the meme coin hype.\
Coldware (COLD) is a project of distinction in the crypto space, owing to its robust platform that combines DeFi offerings such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming with a meme-euphoria. Hence, Coldware (COLD) attracts retail investors and institutional investors and whales alike, requiring a foothold of stability and growth in their portfolios.\
Coldware (COLD) is unique in that it has already begun gaining recognition for its staggering presale with a whopping 1300% gain in valuation in the past period. Therefore, Coldware has begun to make its insightful mark as one of the DeFi leading lights. Coldware guarantees to maintain an appeal as an investment with long-term utility and real-world use cases.Dogecoin (DOGE): A Meme Coin with a Legacy\
That was a fine introduction to Dogecoin-DOGE-in public originals, as the so-called currency was a hilarious scheme based on the meme ''Doge''. Since then, the "meme" has been going through thick and thin, building up a dedicated community and capturing interest from key figures like a majority of investors like Elon Musk among others.\
Being social media-driven to viral trends, DOGE has proven time and again to be a speculative asset. From this journey of being currency-like PSG to the market darling, one dream comes true: the demonstration of how far meme culture can go in our age.\
Very favourable Dogecoin-(DOGE) just has gone hot-and-cold with great discomfort-its value moving with viral spark much more than pillar infrastructure or utility. Although DOGE has loyal devotees, many investors are increasingly questioning the viability of a project that is purely speculative hype; newer projects are starting to offer utility and real-world value-tangibles the market can stand behind.Why Dogecoin Holders Are Moving to Coldware (COLD)Many Dogecoin (DOGE) holders, who have experienced significant volatility and price dips, are now seeking more reliable options. Coldware (COLD) presents a promising opportunity for these investors, offering a token with real utility and a proven growth model.

The increasing influx of DOGE holders into  reflects the growing demand for utility-driven projects in the crypto space.\
With its unique blend of meme culture and decentralized finance, Coldware (COLD) is set to become a major player in the crypto world in 2025, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking for sustainable growth.\
As the  matures, Coldware (COLD) stands poised to take the lead with its strong DeFi foundation and exciting future prospects.\

Coldware’s unique position in the IoT sector is catching the attention of investors and analysts alike, raising the question whether it will soon surpass the likes of Hedera and other IoT-focused cryptocurrencies in terms of adoption and price growth.\
Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a distinct key player on the Internet of Things and offers the decentralized infrastructure purposely developed to meet the growing needs of IoT applications.\
Coldware promises to give fast, secure, and scalable connections with all kinds of devices on its blockchain-powered platform. This distinguishes it from competitors such as Hedera, which is already quite popular for focusing on IoT applications.\
Coldware's blockchain is all geared up for scalability and efficiency, which is also the basis for its ability to capture the IoT market. As billions of devices continue to connect the world closer and closer together, Coldware is all set to pave the way to become a leader in the industry where all and sundry will be looking for seamless connectivity and real-time, secure transactions.Coldware's Growth Potential and Market PositionWhile Hedera’s recent surge following Grayscale's filing for an HBAR ETF has made headlines, Coldware’s potential could surpass that of Hedera in the long term.\
Coldware (COLD) is currently in its  stages, offering early investors a unique opportunity to secure positions at a low price before its market debut. As the project continues to develop and attract attention, experts predict that Coldware’s value could rise exponentially in the coming years.\
Unlike Hedera, Coldware's focus is not solely on IoT applications but extends into a broader range of industries, including healthcare, supply chain management, and more. This multi-sector utility, combined with its seamless integration with IoT, puts Coldware on the fast track for widespread adoption.Price Predictions for Coldware (COLD)As of March 2025, Coldware (COLD) is in presale in its early phases, but analysts have predicted that it has a steep upward incline.\
If the project gains traction and gets its share of strategic partnerships, experts are forecasting a price increase of 1,300% over the next 12 to 18 months, which could see Coldware catapulted into the top 50 cryptocurrencies.\
With the rapid expansion of Coldware's market capitalization as the ecosystem develops and its application in IoT and other fields becomes widespread, Coldware's exceptional blockchain concept focussing on tangible real-world applications will launch it as one of the premier cryptocurrencies in the IoT field, overtaking even the ones that are now popularizing the same space such as Hedera (HAD).Coldware vs Hedera (HBAR): Which Will Lead the IoT Market?Both Coldware and Hedera (HBAR) are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain solutions in IoT.\
However, Coldware’s focus on scalability, cost-efficiency, and its broad application in multiple industries could enable it to dominate the market more rapidly than Hedera, which has historically been limited in terms of its adoption outside the IoT niche.\
The introduction of institutional support through ETFs for Hedera (HBAR) may give it an immediate boost in terms of market recognition, but Coldware’s long-term strategy to integrate IoT with blockchain on a global scale gives it an edge that could propel it to new heights in the coming years.Conclusion: Coldware’s Future Looks BrightWith the rise of IoT and the increasing importance of blockchain technology, Coldware is emerging as a dominant force in the space. As more enterprises adopt Coldware’s blockchain infrastructure for IoT solutions, its price is expected to rise significantly.\
Investors who enter early on could see substantial returns as the project grows and attracts institutional interest.\
While Hedera (HBAR) has made strides with the recent ETF filing, Coldware's superior scalability and diverse applications across various industries put it in a prime position to outperform Hedera and other IoT cryptocurrencies over the long term.\
Investors looking to capitalize on the booming IoT sector should keep a close eye on Coldware, as it could become the next big thing in the cryptocurrency market.\

However, despite their recent uptick, they still fall short when compared to a rising star in the space—Coldware (COLD). Priced below $1, Coldware (COLD) is making waves due to its unique combination of meme-driven energy and real-world utility, making it an enticing alternative to the speculative nature of DOGE and SHIB.Coldware (COLD): A Utility Gem Priced Below $1Here comes the , a cryptocurrency that's on its way to becoming very popular due to the combination of simple fun like meme culture with practical long-term utility.\
Plus, unlike DOGE and SHIB, Coldware (COLD) has marked itself as a  platform associated with real-world use cases. Hence, perhaps it's a great catch for retail investors and even major institutional players looking for their few platitudes yet enabling a full stack moving on a very promising path toward growth.\
The arrival of those people – especially the whales – holding DOGE and SHIB coins to Coldware (COLD), who seek a diversified portfolio beyond just , is attributed to the infrastructure brought about by Coldware in decentralized finance because it assures users of decentralized and secured scalable financial solutions. By the way, presale of Coldware (COLD) had an increase already that reached 1,300 percent.\
Cold Token thus presents a unique proposition within the cryptocurrency ecosystem—transforming the meme-driven excitement into decentralized finance (DeFi) features such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming. The marriage of meme culture with real utility sets it up as a clear alternative for those who want to invest in some fanciful aspects while not compromising on the functionality.The Memes Behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the poster child of meme coins. Initially created as a joke in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, DOGE quickly gained traction due to its quirky, fun nature and the involvement of high-profile supporters like Elon Musk.\
What started as a playful jab at the seriousness of other cryptocurrencies turned into a massive phenomenon. Over time, Dogecoin has evolved from a meme into a token with actual market value, driven by a loyal fanbase and viral social media campaigns. However, the volatility and lack of concrete utility in its design have left many questioning its long-term viability.\
Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB), often referred to as the "Dogecoin killer," was launched in 2020 with the goal of building a meme-based community that could rival DOGE. Shiba Inu’s vast supply and fun, meme-centric branding quickly made it popular, and its recent developments, such as its decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, have made it more than just a meme coin.\
Yet, despite its growing ecosystem, SHIB faces similar concerns regarding its speculative nature and whether it can sustain growth in the long term without more significant use cases.\
Despite their impressive achievements, DOGE and SHIB continue to rely significantly on speculative trading and social media buzz. Investors who are searching for more than simply the next viral trend continue to have concerns about their lack of a strong infrastructure or real utility.Why Coldware (COLD) Is Gaining MomentumAs DOGE and SHIB maintain their speculative appeal,  provides the stability and growth potential that investors are increasingly looking for. Coldware (COLD) offers a secure platform with scalable financial solutions, empowering users to participate in a wide range of DeFi opportunities. For whales and institutional investors, Coldware (COLD) provides a sustainable alternative to meme coins, with the added benefit of a fully operational DeFi ecosystem.\
The presale momentum of Coldware (COLD) highlights the growing demand for a cryptocurrency that offers both utility and excitement. With a secure, decentralized platform, Coldware is making significant strides toward reshaping the landscape of meme coins, attracting a diverse range of investors who are seeking a more stable, long-term investment.For more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:Join and become a community member::::tip

In the month after Election Day alone, the S&P 500 Index jumped more than 5%, adding some $2.8 trillion in value, on the expectation that the new administration would juice the economy.

Then, even as enthusiasm eased as the calendar turned to 2025, mainly on concerns tariffs and deportations could stoke inflation, stocks remained at or near all-time highs. The S&P 500 hit a record on Feb. 19, putting it up 6.3%, or more than $3 trillion, since Election Day. Two weeks later, those gains are gone

Columbia Business School professor and former Goldman Sachs senior investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen examines the broad ripple effects of the costly trade dispute between the US and its closest trading partners, and how they will ultimately trickle down to American citizens. Professor Cohen speaks with Tom Keene and Jess Menton on Bloomberg Radio.

You have a job lined up, but no way to receive your salary. You need a permanent address to open a bank account, but you need a bank account to rent an apartment.That was my experience as an immigrant in Portugal. I thought, ‘This is a massive problem—I can fix it.’ Six months, €500K, and 5,000 users later, my neobank Relocare was dead.I’m Dmitry, a fintech entrepreneur with 13 years in the industry. My company, Finbox Solutions, helps startups scale financial platforms. With multiple fintech ventures under my belt, I thought I was ready to build a neobank. I was wrong.With multiple fintech ventures under my belt and deep technical expertise in banking infrastructure, I felt well-equipped to tackle the challenges of building a neobank.Relocation and How It StartedI didn’t have the purpose to leave my country, it happened mostly accidentally. I visited Portugal for the Web Summit conference in 2018.\
At the conference, I met prominent figures like Ray Dalio (Investor), Tim Berners-Lee (Inventor of the Web) and Evan Williams (Founder of Twitter & Medium).It was an amazing and exciting experience.\
This vibe on the edge of technologies helped me decide to stay longer. When COVID-19 hit in 2020, what started as a temporary stay turned into a permanent move.\
Portugal has one of the best fintech environments for startups, providing legal frameworks, startup ecosystem and has big expat community, around 1.1m people. Add to the fact, awesome weather, good location and its all I needed that time.\
The first thing in settling in a foreign country is to get the required papers. For us, it meant opening a local bank account.The hardest thing for immigrants in any country is opening a local bank account. For citizens of Portugal, it takes up to 3 days, but for immigrants, the term exceeds 2-3 weeks. And it’s not a bank, but documents that it requires.\
The brutal irony? You need a bank account to start your life, but you need to have started your life to get a bank account.\
Every morning becomes a new bureaucratic adventure. You need a NIF (tax number) to open a bank account, but you need proof of address to get a NIF. You need a bank account to rent an apartment, but you need a permanent address for a bank account. Each document costs money - a NIF alone can set you back 100 euros. And that's just one piece of the puzzle.\
I watched people burn through their savings on temporary accommodations while waiting for bank accounts. Highly skilled professionals reduced to carrying cash like students, unable to receive their salaries or pay bills properly.\
That all made the process annoying and frustrating. But it’s not all….\
Portugal has a closed banking system. It means, if you have an account in international bank, then there is no guarantee it’s legit in Portugal.\
I personally had an account in Brazilian branch of Santander. When I came to the Portuguese branch, local clerks stared at me in utter confusion, like “what are you…”\
Different branches don’t recognize each other. Credit history, proof of employment, any other documents mean nothing. Start from scratch, boy! I was devastated.Decision to build a neobankThe banking challenges I experienced firsthand, combined with countless similar stories from other immigrants, highlighted a clear gap in the market. My fintech background provided unique insight into how these problems could be solved systematically.\
This led to the creation of Relocare, a neobank specifically designed to address the unique challenges immigrants face when establishing their financial presence in a new country. Plus, I saw the market as underserved and wanted to challenge myself: “Can I build it and scale?”That’s how It started.How I Applied Product Mindset to RelocareWhen developing Relocare, we focused on deep validation:In mid-2020, conducted 50+ interviews with immigrants and identified their pain points (not possible to get a loan, hard to get a banking account)By Q3 2020, created landing page for signups and distributed across immigrant communities. We got 13,000 on the waitlist.Focused on 3 features during MVP stage:- Local IBAN- Credit card for immigrants- Local payment system integration (MBWay)Thanks to our B2B business, we already had robust technical infrastructure for:However, operating as a bank requires a banking license, which takes years and millions in capital to obtain. By late 2020, we partnered with a BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service) provider who could give us regulatory coverage and access to the banking network. While we had the technical capability to build everything, we needed their license to operate legally. Unfortunately, their risk appetite was quite low, and they saw immigrants as high-risk clients. This conservative approach would later work against us.Business Model & Revenue StreamsWe followed the proven revenue model that successful neobanks like Revolut had established. Our approach was straightforward:Monthly subscription — to access any service in our app, users needed to subscribe to a monthly plan. We wanted to charge 12,5 euro/month (It was naive). This supposed to be our primary revenue source (around 70% of total revenue).Transactional fees — Our BaaS (banking as a service) partner, who owned the infrastructure and carried the risk, set certain transaction fees. This generated approximately 25% of our projected income.Additional services — we put costs of processing into this stream, which might generate 5% of revenue: translation and document processing,Unit economics looked promising on paper.We had expectations on numbers:Forecasted CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) — 50 euro.Expected customer lifetime (LTV) — 12 monthsTarget LTV/CAC ratio — 3:1.Subscription cost — 12.5 euro/monthWith Relocare's business and financial model in hand, we began seeking investors. Initially, we planned to bootstrap the project, but weren't certain about the actual costs involved. We had 10 candidates to co-invest in the project, but it didn't work out. We decided to build on our own, using our money from B2B SaaS. Using “assets” from previous projects, we crafted MVP in 2 months and launched it in our user community.Launch and first problemsWhen we launched Relocare in January 2021, 13,000 users from our waitlist turned into 5,000 MAU. Our technical infrastructure handled the scale perfectly, but the BaaS partnership created unexpected challenges:Immediately we’ve started to face fraud problems. It started as early as the 5th issued card. That moment we realized, what banks meant by high risk clients (meaning immigrants)Users started complaining about our strict KYC/AML policies. We couldn’t process everything related to crypto, NFT. Users literally felt rejected.Despite positive feedback about core features like IBAN and MBWay, many users felt rejected by our strict verification process.\
These early problems were just the beginning of our market fit issues.While these initial operational challenges were concerning, the deeper problems with Relocare's business model began to surface around the six-month mark. Our data started revealing a troubling pattern: users were churning.\
We started to investigate, by analyzing user feedback, conducting interviews again, and seeking patterns across accounts in our Amplitude panel. And here is what we found so far:Most immigrants struggle for the first six months, and it’s all good after they open a local bank account. It removes us from value chain. They don’t need us after the temporary challenge.They also used Wise and Revolut along the way. Those companies provide global banking services and they’re more friendly to immigrants than local banks.What we initially saw as a significant market opportunity turned out to be a temporary pain point. This fundamental realization meant that a neobank exclusively for immigrants had a built-in churn problem—users would naturally leave once they established themselves in the country.The Numbers That Killed UsOur illusions on unit economics also broke down. We expected to have:\
Lifetime as 12 months but 6 months in reality.\
Pricing, that changed from 12,5 to only 8 euro per month.\
With mounting costs and deteriorating metrics, we needed a bigger investment to turn things around. After spending €500K of our own money, our calculations showed we needed around €10M to make the business viable. While we managed to attract about €1M in potential investor interest, it wasn't enough.Standing at this crossroads with Relocare, we explored every possible direction:Dive into new products around neobanks.Dive into crypto-powered cross-border payments (which was highly requested thing in a project)Credit solutions for expats, helping them get financing in a new country\
All of that wasn’t a part of our expertise. Lending is too hard, you need to assess credit risk and onboard clients with strong policy. Crypto also wasn’t our main focus, we weren’t sure what to build.\
Our final analysis put the final nail in the coffin. We realized:We couldn’t compete with Revolut and Wise, which had far more resources and funding.We needed €10M+ to build a sustainable lending model, and even with €1M in potential investor interest, the gap was too large to bridge.\
With an already profitable B2B business, we decided not to lose focus here and closed it. We sort of saved money for our investors, spending only 500,000 euros. Now, it’s time to share what we’ve learned from experience.Looking back, Relocare's journey taught me some painful but invaluable lessons that I hope will help other founders avoid similar pitfalls:\
1. Beware of Transition Period Business ModelsThe hard truth we discovered: building a business around a temporary problem is like trying to catch smoke. Our users needed us intensely for 4-6 months, then vanished. It's like building a business selling umbrellas only when it rains – the demand is real but fleeting.\
2. Market Size ≠ Market OpportunityThe 1.1M expat market in Portugal looked fantastic on paper. But here's the reality check: only 15% of these expats were actually in our target segment (tech-savvy, middle-income professionals), and only 10% of those converted to paying customers. Always dig deeper into your TAM calculations.\
3. The "Good Enough" ProblemWe learned that existing solutions like Wise and Revolut were "good enough" for most users. They weren't perfect for immigrants, but they worked. The lesson? Your solution needs to be 10x better than existing alternatives, not just marginally better.\
For founders eyeing the fintech space: the future isn't in building another bank – it's in solving the infrastructure problems that make banking difficult in the first place. And that's exactly what we discovered through this journey.Despite Relocare's shutdown in mid-2021, we didn't walk away empty-handed. We built several valuable assets that we're now repurposing:DocSense: Relocare's AI tool for PDF analysis has found unexpected demand in the B2B sector.PayMaster: The tax calculator developed for Relocare has become a standalone product with growing adoption.Mobile App Architecture: We're licensing parts of the secure banking infrastructure we built for Relocare to other fintech startups.After shutting down Relocare in mid-2021, I returned to B2B fintech, focusing on these opportunities:Cross-Border Credit Infrastructure: The big unsolved problem isn't payments – it's credit history portability across bordersB2B Banking Services: Helping businesses navigate international banking has more staying power than consumer solutionsRegulatory Tech: Tools that help fintech companies navigate complex compliance requirementsBrokerage SaaS Solutions: Enabling fintech startups to launch investment & trading servicesNeobank Infrastructure: Providing white-label fintech solutionsPayroll Fintech: Simplifying global salary paymentsIf you have any questions about this story, then find me on social media.Looking back at this 2021 venture, I hope this post-mortem of Relocare has provided valuable insights.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hollywood actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa died of natural causes | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z_QsQe960o</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1z_QsQe960o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 10:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Medical examiners provide more answers following the deaths of Hollywood actor Gene Hackman and his wife.

The two-year mission will repeatedly survey the entire sky and help scientists understand fundamental cosmic processes. NBC News reports: The launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California is scheduled to occur Friday, during a window that opens at 10:09 p.m. ET. Liftoff was initially planned for Feb. 27, but NASA rescheduled it several times, first to "complete vehicle processing and prelaunch checkouts," and because of availability at the California launch site.
 
The cone-shaped spacecraft -- along with four suitcase-sized satellites that NASA will deploy at the same time on a separate mission to study the sun -- will launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The $488 million SPHEREx mission, which has been in development for about a decade, is designed to map the celestial sky in 102 infrared colors -- more than any other mission before it, according to NASA.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Markets Have Been &apos;Punched in the Face,&apos; Zelter Says</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHmqtKy8RTI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QHmqtKy8RTI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 08:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apollo President Jim Zelter and Schonfeld CEO Ryan Tolkin talk to Sonali Basak about the impact of tariffs on investors and markets at Bloomberg Invest in New York.

Volkswagen also introduced haptic ‘sliders’ below the touchscreen for the heating and volume and it started using haptic panels instead of buttons for controls mounted on the steering wheel.More recently, the firm has reintroduced physical steering wheel buttons and Mindt said it is committed to reintroducing physical buttons, starting with the production version of the ID 2all concept that will arrive next year.“From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions – the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light – below the screen,” said Mindt. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this.“We will never, ever make this mistake any more. On the steering wheel, we will have physical buttons. No guessing any more. There's feedback, it's real, and people love this. Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.”Mindt said VW will continue to offer cars with touchscreens, in part due to new legal requirements that, as in the US, will require all cars to feature a reversing camera. “There are a lot of functions you have to deliver in certain areas, so the screen will be big and you will find a lot of HMI [human-machine interface] contents in the depths of the system,” he added. “But the five main things will always be on the first physical layer. That’s very important.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: This Browser-based Editor Generates Stunning Isometric Tile Maps in Pixel Art Style (3/8/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/3-8-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 07:11:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @superlinked [ 11 Min read ]

We encountered two main challenges that we had to tackle when generating XPath expressions.\
 Randomly generated queries could be semantically correct, but reference non-existent nodes or attributes. For the document in Figure 1, //Author[@id < 1] is a valid XPath expression. However, none of the Author nodes contain an id attribute. Thus, XPath returns an empty sequence for each node, causing the predicate @id < 1 to evaluate to false. We believe that queries, where only non-existent attributes or nodes are referenced, are less likely to exercise the logic of the processors under test, as subsequent operations are likely to evaluate to an empty sequence as well. Thus, we aim to avoid generating such queries.\
 Randomly generated predicates might likely evaluate to false and cause queries to generate empty result sets. For the document in Figure 1, the XPath predicate starts-with(text(), x) identifies nodes whose text starts with x. If x is a randomly generated string, the possibility is high that no nodes in the current result set match the condition. Consequently, any use of the predicate would yield an empty result. Any subsequently added section would yield an empty result as well, meaning that such queries would be less likely to exercise the processor under test. Consequently, we want to avoid generating such predicates, in particular, when they involve multiple sections. This relates to the first problem, as non-existent nodes or attributes can also introduce empty results.\
 We designed the XPath generation process of XPress tackling the two aforementioned issues. To create XPath expressions that refer to valid nodes and attributes to trigger deeper logic of the system under test, we generate queries that reference existent context relative to the so-called targeted node, such as its tag name and attributes (steps 3 and 4). Since randomly generated predicates might miss the targeted node from the result set, we rectify the generated expressions to ensure the inclusion of the targeted node (step 5).\
Iterative section generation. We create XPath expressions sectionby-section by executing step ○2 to step ○5 for each section, which allows us to ensure non-empty results after generating each section. In the example, we first generate section /Books by selecting as the targeted node, and after executing steps 2 to step  , the result of /Books is non-empty—containing the node. Based on this, we further proceed to generate the next section /Book[count(Author) > 1] starting at step 2.\
 We randomly generate one of the applicable section prefixes. First, we randomly select the start of the section to be / or //. We then retrieve the current context node sequence by executing the expression—/Books in the example—on a processor. Based on the result, we include all possible axes that would not lead to an empty result set by simple conditional checks. We support all 11 axes described in the XPath 3.0 standard [4]. For example, applying the axis /descendants:: will lead to a non-empty result, if at least one non-leaf node exists in the current selection. From the possible axes, we select a random one and apply it. When generating the section prefix /Book, the axis step is implicit. It is equivalent to /Books/child::Book, which selects all child nodes of the previously selected nodes. We again execute the query and retrieve the result node-set. We use the result for the name test, for which we either select a tag name from the result node-set, or use the wildcard *. By doing so, we are again guaranteed a non-empty result set. In the example, the tag name Book is selected and applied, resulting in the selection of all three Book nodes. In our artifact, we include a table that details the conditional checks for all 11 axes.\
 To generate targeted queries that fetch at least one node, we select a so-called targeted node to guide the predicate generation process. We use information about the target node, such as its text content, the attributes it holds, and its relationship to other nodes during the predicate generation. This is similar to the concept of the pivot row in PQS [36], which is a technique that has been proposed to test relational DBMSs. After the generated predicate is applied, we expect the target node to be included in the result node-set. In step 3, we select node 1 as the target node for the predicate generation process. Constraining the context to exist for the targeted node does not affect the evaluation of the expression on other candidate nodes and, therefore, still allows finding bugs that are triggered only when referring to nodes’ non-existing attributes or child nodes.\
 We use a tree structure to represent the predicate and take a bottom-up construction approach to enable tracking of expression results along tree construction. We start generating the predicate from a specific subject, which is either the targeted node or a node sequence derived from the targeted node with equal probability. In the example, we select the child node sequence from the targeted node as the subject. We then iteratively apply random function nodes and supply function parameters to construct the predicate, until the predicate reaches a desired length. We keep track of the data type and value of the current subexpression when constructing the predicate, by executing the subexpression on one randomly chosen XML processor—we use this XML processor also for predicate rectification and we subsequently refer to this XML processor as the designated XML processor. We use the value and data type of the current sub-expression in the following two ways: by (1) selecting function nodes of according data types and (2) supplying arguments to reference existent context and triggering corner cases. Specifically, we select a random function node from functions that could accept the value of the current data type as input. A function node can either represent a function or an operation. In the example, Author is a node sequence and count is a randomly selected function from functions that accept node sequence as input. For function nodes that require additional arguments, we supply arguments while taking the current result value into consideration. As an example, when selecting attribute values from node sequences, we use name tests referencing existent attributes. For the = operator, we choose an operand that is equal to the current value with a high probability of triggering the equal case which is of low probability under random generation. Aside from constants, we also set the possibility for operands to be other predicate trees. Through this, we support the generation of expressions with multiple subject occurrences. Besides boolean predicates, we also apply positional predicates to the XPath expression randomly.\
 Lastly, we rectify the generated predicate to guarantee that the targeted node is contained in the final result set. We first execute the generated predicate on the designated XML processor. If the result set misses the targeted node, we rectify the predicate. To negate the predicate’s result, we can always apply a not operator. However, as shown in Algorithm 1, we probabilistically apply more specific rectification for certain operators to uncover additional potential bugs. For logical operators such as and, both child expressions need to be modified to evaluate to true to contain the targeted node, while or needs only modification of one random child expression. For comparison operators, such as <=, we replace them with their opposite operators, which, in the example, is >. Thus, the targeted node is guaranteed to be contained in the result set.(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Approach and Differential Testing for XML Processors</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-approach-and-differential-testing-for-xml-processors?source=rss</link><author>XPath</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 03:01:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Figure 3 shows an overview of the approach using the same example as in Figure 1. At a high level, our approach consists of three main steps. First, we randomly generate an XML document as the context for the following queries (step 1). We then generate an XPath expression that we will subsequently validate (step 2 to step 5). Finally, we execute the XPath expression on the XML document using all engines under test and compare the resulting outputs to detect potential bugs (step 6). In the subsequent subsections, we explain these steps in reverse order to reflect their importance.\
We guide the XPath expression generation towards queries that reference nodes and attributes present in the XML document and result in non-empty result sets based on the intuition that they are more likely to stress the underlying logic of the tested systems. To generate XPath expressions with non-empty result sets, we construct the query section-by-section and ensure that a non-empty result set is produced before proceeding with the next section. Each section consists of a section prefix and predicates, and we first generate the prefix (step 2) and then the predicate. By restricting the section prefix, we guarantee that the result contains at least one node. From the nodes selected by the section prefix, we randomly select a node as a target (step 3). We then generate a predicate aiming to select the targeted node using a bottom-up tree construction method (step 4). We rectify the predicate to ensure that the result set contains the targeted node (step 5). We repeat this process until the XPath query reaches the desired length.3.1 Differential Testing for XML ProcessorsAs detailed subsequently, differential testing enables us to find both logic bugs as well as internal errors when comparing the results of XML processors implementing the same XPath standard.\
 When passing XML documents and XPath queries to different systems, we must account for the different\
input interfaces. For example, DBMSs use database connection interfaces to store and query data, while Saxon can be used as a library. To abstract this, we treat every XML processor implementation as a function that returns a result set and expects two string values, namely an XML document XML and an XPath query XPATH. Listing 1 shows an implementation of this interface for Oracle Database using SQL statements. It creates a table t, inserts the XML document—the XMLType constructor is used to convert the string to an XML data type—and uses an XMLQuery function call in a SELECT statement to compute the result set. For BaseX and eXist-db, similar to the commands shown for Oracle Database, we also start with an empty database and subsequently insert an XML document. Listing 2 shows an excerpt of the Java code for Saxon. First, the call to compile converts the textual XPath query to an executable object, which is then loaded. Unlike for the DBMSs, which require inserting data into a database, for Saxon, the XML document is simply associated with the query using the setContextItem call. The evaluate call computes the result, which is returned for comparison.\
 We identify both logic bugs and internal errors by comparing the returned results of different processors on the same XML document and query. We identify logic bugs when the tested systems return different node-set outputs for the same test cases. To parse and track the results easily under different output formats, we use unique node ids to identify element nodes. We detect internal errors as discrepancies with respect to errors. Rather than checking for an exact error message match, we validate whether all the systems produce an error, or all execute the XPath query successfully. If only a subset of the systems report an error for the same XPath query, we found a potential bug.\
Different XPath standards. Our approach and tool are applicable to both XPath 1.0 and XPath 3.0. However, due to the differences in the formats, only processors using the same standard can be tested. Functionality that is supported only in XPath 3.0, can be disabled while generating test cases for processors that implement XPath 1.0. For example, sequence functions, such as subsequence, are defined only for the XPath 3.0 standard. When generating test cases for XPath 1.0 processors, we omit to generate subsequence function nodes for predicates. We did not encounter any functions or operators that were removed in the XPath 3.0 standard, so all expressions that we generate when testing XPath 1.0 processors can be used also when testing XPath 3.0 processors. By comparing only processors with the same XPath standard against each other, the difference in the results between different XPath standards (see Section 2) has no influence on the testing process.(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>XML, XPath, XPath Structure, and More Explained</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/xml-xpath-xpath-structure-and-more-explained?source=rss</link><author>XPath</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 02:44:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Figure 1 shows a running example that we will subsequently use to explain basic XML and XPath concepts and outline the challenges of automated testing as applied in this context. The left shows an XML document with the root node Books, while the right shows an XPath expression //*[@id * -1 < 2]. We adapted this example from a bug-inducing test case that XPress discovered.[2] As shown, for the query on the document, BaseX returned an empty result, while both Saxon and eXist returned all three Book nodes.\
. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a text format for describing structured data. XML documents are trees that consist of nodes, as illustrated in Figure 1. An XML document has a single root element node (see ). Each element node has a tag name (see Books, Book, and Author). Element nodes can include attribute nodes. For example, two of the nodes have both attribute nodes id and year. An element node can also include child element nodes; in the example, the node contains three child element nodes. Element nodes can hold text contents, which can be of any defined data type. For the node with attribute id = 1, the text content it holds is "A fairy tale". Attribute nodes are disallowed from holding child nodes. In the example, id and year are integer-typed attribute nodes and the name attributes are string-typed attribute nodes.\
. The XPath language is an expression language that allows navigating the XML tree and hierarchic addressing of the element nodes. XPath is at the core of both  -  [7] and , a more expressive query language for XML [6]. XSLT transforms XML documents into other formats and the XQuery language is a super-set of XPath expressions. XQuery extends XPath to provide functionalities such as node constructors and SQL-like clauses.\
 An XPath expression describes the selection and transformation of nodes of the XML tree. Figure 2 shows a simplified XPath 3.0 [4] grammar using EBNF notation from the W3C XML 1.0 standard [3]. We introduce the non-established terms  and  to describe our generation approach in\
Section 3.2. XPath expressions consist of one or more sections, and a section contains one section prefix followed by zero or more predicates. In Figure 1, the XPath expression //*[@id*(-1)<2] consists of a single section with section prefix //* and a single predicate [@id*(-1)<2]. Each section prefix starts with either / or //. / is called the path operator, which accepts a node sequence as the left-hand operand and orders it in document order while eliminating duplicate nodes. // represents the abbreviated relative path /descendant-or-self::node()/, which matches the current context and all descendant nodes of the current context, regardless of the intermediate path. An axis step consists of an optional axis and a name test.\
 Axes define the relationship between selected nodes and current context nodes. For example, the axis parent:: selects all parent nodes of current context nodes. If omitted, it is equivalent to child::, which selects all direct children nodes of current context nodes. A name test is a string literal to fetch only nodes with the same tag name. It could also be a wildcard *, which matches all nodes without applying filters. The section prefix //* in the example selects all descendant nodes of the document node, which is all element nodes in the document.\
 Predicates in XPath include positional predicates and boolean predicates. Positional predicates contain an expression that evaluates to a single integer and select only values whose position in the context matches the integer value. In the XPath expression /Books/Book[1], [1] is a positional predicate and selects only the first child of , which is the node with @id=1. Boolean predicates evaluate current context nodes to a boolean value according to a given expression and only nodes for which the predicate evaluates to true are selected. In Figure 1, [@id * -1 < 2] is a boolean predicate. The query //*[@id * -1 < 2] selects all nodes in the XML document with attribute id that satisfy id * -1 < 2. The three nodes with tag name Book in the document have attribute id, and all satisfy the condition. Therefore, if correctly evaluated, this query should return all three Book nodes.\
 For the test input in Figure 1, systems like Saxon and eXist-DB both returned a result set with three Book nodes, while BaseX returned an empty result set. The difference between the processors indicates a potential bug. Based on our manual analysis, we suspected that BaseX computed an incorrect result, which is why we reported it to the BaseX developers. They fixed the bug quickly. The reason for this bug was an incorrect simplification of the arithmetic expression x * a > b to x > b / a. When the divisor is a negative number, the original operator > should be reversed to <.\
. There are majorly two different standards of XPath implementations in use today, which we need to consider in our work. The XPath 1.0 standard was the first version. As a superset of XPath 1.0, the XPath 3.0 standard is the latest standard of the XPath language and provides more functionalities such as advanced data types and functions [5]. Most multi-model DBMSs, which support XPath queries, support only XPath 1.0 [1] (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL). While some specialized XML processors support also only XPath 1.0 (e.g., libXML2), others support the more recent XPath 3.0 standard (e.g., BaseX, eXist-DB, and Saxon).\
XPath versions and differential testing. The same queries might produce different results under different standards. For example, for the XPath expression Book/@name = false(), under the XPath 1.0 standard, the expression is expected to return true. @name is first cast into its equivalent boolean value. In the current case has no name attribute, therefore, an empty node set is returned. The equivalent boolean value evaluates to false for empty nodes. Comparing false to false is equal, therefore true is returned. Under the XPath 3.0 standard, however, the result is expected to be false. @name returns an empty sequence and equality comparison between an empty sequence and a boolean value false would evaluate to false. Thus, applying differential testing to XML processors supporting different standards is infeasible.[2] https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex/issues/2188(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Open-Source DocumentAI with Ollama</title><link>https://rlama.dev/</link><author>Dontizi</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 02:12:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Open-source project.

In , we focused on collecting market intelligence from custom-built MCP servers for forex price and social media posts. That was more of a “READ” function and needs to be expanded into a “” function. Therefore, in Part 2, we will be connecting to MCP servers that can  for our forex trader.AI Agents With Wallets: The Powerful Convergence of AI and Web3The phrase "An AI agent with a wallet is a powerful thing" has become increasingly prominent at Web3 gatherings like the recent ETHDenver 2025. This simple statement encapsulates a transformative concept at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Let's explore why this combination is generating so much excitement and what it means for the future of digital interactions.What Are AI Agents With Wallets?AI agents with wallets are autonomous software systems powered by artificial intelligence that can directly interact with blockchains through cryptocurrency wallets. Unlike traditional AI assistants that merely provide information, these agents can take financial actions independently - sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and managing digital assets.\
The key innovation is combining:: Systems that can perceive, learn, reason, and act: Direct access to decentralized financial systems: The ability to execute financial transactions without human interventionThe power of AI agents with crypto wallets stems from several capabilities:Autonomous Financial Actions: Agents can directly interact with blockchains to execute trades, provide liquidity, participate in governance, or manage investments without constant human supervision. \n 24/7 Operation: Unlike humans, AI agents can monitor markets and take action continuously without fatigue. \n Complex Decision Making: Advanced models can analyze vast amounts of on-chain and off-chain data to make sophisticated decisions about market trends, investment opportunities, and risk management. \n Programmable Economics: Creating systems where AI agents can participate in economic activities opens new possibilities for resource allocation and value creation. \n Reduced Intermediaries: By giving AI agents direct financial capabilities, many processes that traditionally required human middlemen can be automated.AI agents with wallets are already finding use in several domains:: Managing yield farming, liquidity provision, and optimal trading strategies across decentralized exchanges. \n : Automatically rebalancing crypto holdings based on market conditions and risk parameters. \n : Generating digital art and making strategic decisions about NFT purchases and sales. \n : Analyzing proposals and voting based on predefined parameters or community sentiment. \n : AI agents like Truth Terminal have emerged as content creators who can directly receive cryptocurrency payments.Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a pivotal infrastructure layer at the intersection of AI agents and Web3, particularly for agents equipped with cryptocurrency wallets. Released by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP provides a standardized framework that enables AI agents to interact seamlessly with diverse data sources including blockchain networks, smart contracts, and decentralized applications.\
For wallet-enabled AI agents, MCP serves as the crucial communication bridge that allows them to maintain contextual awareness when processing on-chain data, interpreting transaction histories, and making financial decisions autonomously. This protocol eliminates the need for custom integrations with each blockchain or DeFi platform, significantly reducing development complexity while ensuring AI agents can securely access the real-time blockchain data essential for executing transactions and managing digital assets.Enough theory, now, let’s jump into coding action and experiments.\
From Part I of the series, we have all the tools to form real-time intelligence on foreign exchanged related signals, we need action tools that can actually trade the foreign currencies. We could use traditional forex tools, but you probably need both a license to trade and a lot of money to cover the fees. So, we resort to stablecoins and decentralized exchanges for both convenience and the lowest fees.As a first step, you need to have a Solana wallet and its private key. In addition, you need to pre-fund the wallet with a small amount of SOL (e.g. 0.25 SOL).\
Creating a Solana wallet with Phantom is straightforward and user-friendly.First, visit  or download the Phantom app from your device's app store.Click "Create New Wallet," and follow the setup wizard.Phantom will generate a 12-word recovery phrase, which you must write down and store securely offline—this is crucial as it's your only backup if your device is lost or damaged.After confirming your recovery phrase, create a strong password to protect your wallet.\
To open Phantom, go to Settings (gear icon), select "Security and Privacy," then "Export Private Key."You'll need to enter your password to view the key.Never share this with anyone, as it grants complete access to your funds.\
Funding your Phantom wallet with 0.25 SOL requires first acquiring SOL from a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase or Binance. Alternatively, you can receive SOL directly from another person by sharing your wallet address with them. The transfer typically completes within seconds, and you can verify the transaction by checking your wallet balance or viewing your transaction history in the Phantom app.\
Remember that maintaining a small SOL balance is necessary for paying transaction fees on the Solana network.First, get the source code:git clone https://github.com/sendaifun/solana-agent-kit.gitnpm install solana-agent-kit\
cd examples/agent-kit-mcp-serverCode the MCP Server for TradingModify the index.ts file to add some actions for our needs. The example code has the first two actions “gettoken”. We added five more to enable trading as well as query wallet balance and token balance.import { ACTIONS, SolanaAgentKit , startMcpServer  } from "solana-agent-kit";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { get_wallet_address } from "solana-agent-kit/dist/tools/index.js";

dotenv.config();

const agent = new SolanaAgentKit(
    process.env.SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    process.env.RPC_URL!,
    {
        OPENAI_API_KEY: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "",
    },
);

// Add your required actions here
const mcp_actions = {
    GET_ASSET: ACTIONS.GET_ASSET_ACTION,
    DEPLOY_TOKEN: ACTIONS.DEPLOY_TOKEN_ACTION,
    TRADE: ACTIONS.TRADE_ACTION,
    BALANCE: ACTIONS.BALANCE_ACTION,
    GET_INFO: ACTIONS.GET_INFO_ACTION,
    WALLET: ACTIONS.WALLET_ADDRESS_ACTION,
    TOKEN_BALANCES: ACTIONS.TOKEN_BALANCES_ACTION,

}

startMcpServer(mcp_actions, agent, { name: "solana-agent", version: "0.0.1" });
\n For a complete list of actions available from the Solana AgentKit, you can check this file. Currently, there are over 110 actions available.Since it is a TypeScript project, you need to build it.\
And it will create the Node.JS file below, which we will call from the MCP server:Claude Desktop is the MCP client that we will use again in this tutorial. Please  to modify the configuration file, for example in Mac OS.\
~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json{
    "mcpServers": {
        "trader": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_FOLDER/",
                "run",
                "trader.py"
            ]
        },
        "search1api": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "search1api-mcp"
            ],

                "SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY": "YOUR_KEY"
            },
            "args": [
                "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_FOLDER/build/index.js"
            ]
        }
    }
}
\n As you can see, the last MCP server is the one for AgentKit. The RPCURL is pointing to the official public API to Solana Mainnet, while the SOLANAPRIVATE_KEY should be your wallet private key you exported earlier.After re-launching the Claude Desktop client, you should be able to see that now you have 14 tools at your disposal. 7 of them are from the two MCP servers from the last tutorial, while 7 more are from the new AgentKit server.Check the Wallet Balance of SOLThe first thing you will do is check your SOL wallet balance. Sometimes, you need to give the full wallet address. You should be able to see 0.25 SOL in your agent wallet.Optional: Issue a Meme CoinThis is just for fun: deploy a new token on Solana named Manusv2 with an initial supply of 1000000000. This is, of course, unrelated to the forex trading.\
It is extremely easy to deploy a new token on the Solana network, which is very convenient. But it also means there will be gazillions of tokens with similar or same names. Therefore, it is always important to check the token’s Contract Address (CA) to make sure it is the right token that you want to trade.Trade Foreign Currency (Stablecoins)Now, we get to the meat of the trading actions. First, let’s  on the Solana network. USDC is well known, and you do not need to specify the Contract Address. But it is always good practice to double-check.\
 Next, let’s . This time, we do specify the Contract Addrss for EURC (HzwqbKZw8HxMN6bF2yFZNrht3c2iXXzpKcFu7uBEDKtr) since it is a lesser-known stablecoin.\
Wow, that looks so easy! We did not write a single line of code to use API to interact with a Decentralized Exchange to carry out the trade. We just typed in a few words in our favorite desktop chat app: Claude.\
Let that sink in a bit, and appreciate the power of MCP.Check the Wallet Balance of All TokensSometimes, there are multiple MCP tools or actions that can handle similar tasks. The Claude Desktop client is smart enough to try a few of them, and eventually get the correct results.\
You can see it in the example below where I ask for the wallet balance of all tokens. Initially, Claude used BALANCREACTION, which only retired the SOL balance but without the USDC & EURC balance. Once Claude tried TOKENBALANCE_ACTIO, we got a list of all the tokens in the wallet. This shows the flexibility and robustness of the MCP protocol.Just a quick memory refresh about MCP. The three categories of important assets for MCP are: tools, resources, and prompts. We touched upon Tools in the tutorials, and now it is time to talk a bit about .\
MCP clients like Claude Desktop are smart enough to carry out most tasks based on very simple instructions from humans. However, a good prompt is often necessary for more complex tasks. It can still be quite concise, but consider adding the following elements:What is the objective and main askWhat tools and resources do you want MCP to search and executeWhat thinking/planning process you would like to recommendWhat final output should look like\
Now, let’s get on with the combo test for an AI forex trading assistant.Step 1: Analysis and Plan[]: You are my assistant for forex trading. Research recent macro economic news, truth social posts by Trump, and everything else that might impact the forex exchange rate between USD and EUR. Evaluate my current wallet balance. Give me actionable plan: for example, buy or sell USD, buy or sell EUR.[Prompt]: yes proceed with USDC to EURC conversioncheck all token balances in my wallet\
It is always good practice to  by using the Solana Explorer:Practical Assessment of MCPWe talked a lot about  in the first episode. For example, MCP is , and it has excellent momentum and is widely supported by both Web 2 and Web 3 developer communities.\
However, MCP still faces significant usability challenges that limit its accessibility, particularly for non-technical users.Server integration with Claude Desktop remains cumbersome, requiring developers to navigate command-line operations, manage dependencies, and configure ports - creating a substantial barrier to entry.Additionally, the requirement to manually specify which MCP servers to use for each interaction creates unnecessary friction in the user experience. The lack of a streamlined discovery and selection mechanism means users must edit configuration files and restart applications just to add new data sources.\
While these limitations are acknowledged on MCP's development roadmap, addressing them will be crucial for the protocol to realize its full potential as a universal standard for contextual AI assistance beyond the developer community. And we have also seen interesting approaches by the open-source community to address these shortcomings.In this episode, we focused on . We started with the unique importance of AI Agents with Web 3 wallets, and MCP’s role in this emerging vision. Then we went about the practical steps of setting up the Solana AgentKit MCP server, where all our forex trading-related actions were added. We traded some USD and EUR stablecoins. In the final combo test, we use AI Agent as our trading assistant who not only can do smart analysis based on real-time signals but also carry out the actual trades.\
The next and last part of this mini-series will be most exciting: the agent will be autonomous! It will run 24x7. It will wake up periodically, check the latest news and social posts, check his current portfolio position, and make short-medium term action plans against his long-term strategy. If it needs to re-balance the portfolio, it will execute the trades. And hopefully, it will evaluate his own performance and make some adjustments if needed. Are you excited? :-)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DOGE job cuts shake Trump-voting West Virginia town | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9LHUPTMU7w</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/z9LHUPTMU7w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 01:25:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jennifer Piggott, a resident of West Virginia, proudly hung a Trump campaign flag outside her home during the November election race.

These unsolicited messages from unknown sources often fill inboxes, disrupting communication and productivity. This paper investigates the use of various machine learning techniques to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). \
Classification models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naïve Bayes are evaluated, comparing their effectiveness in email classification. The performance of each model is evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine which approach is most suitable for this task.In 2023, there are 347.3 billion emails sent every day, out of which spam emails compose 45% of all email traffic. These email spam costs businesses $20.5 billion every year. Given this, there will always be a need to ensure spam is correctly classified and does not interfere with legitimate email traffic. This is a useful way to understand the potential and application of machine learning. \
In the case of spam detection, a human user familiar with email can easily determine spam almost immediately upon looking at it. As a result, I believe this work confirms that identifying spam is a useful application for a machine learning classifier. To classify an email as spam or ham, there are a lot of preprocessing steps involved – preparing the data to be acceptable to a linear classifier, then tokenizing and stemming each line to convert to a TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency) table. \
KNN with K=3 was selected as the baseline model. Logistic Regression with L1 regularization, the Naïve Bayes model, and SVM models were also tested before deciding the best model. For the purpose of this project, a dataset from Kaggle has been used, which has 2551 “ham” email files and 501 spam email files and the modeling has been done using R programming language.The below chart would help understand the flow of the various steps followed –Given that a large volume of text data is being used, there was a need to preprocess the data to clean it up and get it to a format that can be used by classification models. The following will explain the step-by-step process that was followed as part of the data preprocessing –The text data needs to be acceptable to a linear classifier. This means the dataset must be transformed using text feature extraction methods to numeric features.First, each line of the text is tokenized and stemmed to the following form. The stemming process shortens words by removing inflected endings. For example, workers becomes worker in the below example.Next, the tokenized data is converted to a TF-IDF table (Term frequency - Inverse document frequency). TF-IDF is an approach to text analysis that states each n-gram in a document in terms of its term frequency-inverse document frequency. Term frequency is simply the frequency of a given term within a document (in this case, an email). Inverse document frequency is generally stated as:log ((Total Number of Documents/Number of Documents With Term)\
This serves to weigh significant terms more highly than very frequent and thus less important terms.Next, the terms are reduced by only selecting those terms that have appeared in at least 2 percent of documents but no more than 95 percent of the documents. This process prevents overfitting by ensuring terms are removed which are too unique or too prevalent in the training set.This yields a total of 1,130 terms in the training dataset.It is important to note that the strategy for utilizing TF-IDF with the test set will be to only perform model training on the training TF-IDF, and then subsequently to re-calculate TF-IDF with the complete data for testing accuracy. This is required because TF-IDF is dependent on the frequency in the  dataset of a certain term, and also to not incorporate the test data during training.\
Finally, only the top 1000 terms by overall term frequency are selected in the training set.Code for the Preprocessing steps -#tokenize
word_tokens <- complete_tbl %>% unnest_tokens(word,content)
#stemming
word_tokens<-word_tokens %>% mutate(word_stem=SnowballC::wordStem(word))
#remove any words with numbers
word_tokens <- word_tokens[-grep('^\\d+$', word_tokens$word_stem),]

#remove any words with .

word_tokens <- word_tokens[-grep('[.]', word_tokens$word_stem),]

#remove any single character words

word_tokens <- word_tokens[-grep('.\\b[a-z]\\b.', word_tokens$word_stem),]

#remove tokens which match stop words
word_tokens <- word_tokens %>% filter(!word %in% stopWords)
word_tokens <- word_tokens %>% filter(!word_stem %in% stopWords)

#split into training and test
word_tokens_train <- word_tokens %>% filter(document %in% ind)


  #create tfidf for training and then a complete tfidf for testing
tfidf_train<-word_tokens_train %>% count(document,word_stem,sort=TRUE) %>% bind_tf_idf(word_stem,document,n)
tfidf_complete<-word_tokens %>% count(document,word_stem,sort=TRUE) %>% bind_tf_idf(word_stem,document,n)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – the Baseline modelThe model achieves reasonable specificity but extremely poor sensitivity, meaning many hams are falsely predicted as spam. Note that in each of the below results, the positive class is “ham”. This is really the worst possible outcome for a user in that they would miss many real emails that are classified as spam.\
  \n Code for KNN model -##train a model

##remove document number since this is indicative of spam or ham

After getting poor results from the KNN model, Logistic Regression was the next model used.\
For the purpose of this scenario,Logistic Regression was applied with the following hyperparameters –\
This model provides the following results on the test dataset, already a significant improvement on the KNN model. The overall accuracy is quite high, but the specificity shows there is still some room for improvement. A user of this model would find a few Hams being predicted as Spams. \n  Code for Logistic Regression model -#Next is a logistic regression usin the below hyperparameters

The following table summarizes the measures that were considered for selecting the best model–| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | Precision | Recall |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| KNN | 0.252 | 0.2293 | 0.8947 | 0.1315 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9624 | 0.9781 | 0.9591 | 0.998 |
| Naïve Bayes | 0.9722 | 0.9834 | 0.9882 | 0.9787 |
| SVM | 0.9885 | 0.9932 | 0.9886 | 1 |From the above table, it can be seen that SVM performs the best compared to the other models.\
To further confirm, ROC curves were plotted and the AUC values were computed.| Model | KNN | Logistic Regression | Naïve Bayes | SVM |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| AUC | .5232 | .882 | .9574 | .9628 |Fig: AUC values for the 4 modelsFrom the above metrics, it can be concluded that the SVM with 5-fold cross-validation performs the best on the dataset in classifying the emails as ham and spam.Spam filtering will always be a field with continuous evolution as spammers are constantly finding new and innovative methods to send Spam messages. No single anti-spam solution may be correct. In this project, some of the machine learning tools were used to see how they perform as classifiers for Ham and Spam emails. Descriptions of the calculations are presented as well as a comparison of their performances.\
Out of the four machine learning models that have been tested, SVM was found to be the best in terms of performance. Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes models also show promising results.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Business Lookahead: Europe&apos;s defense, China weathering tariffs | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzreWMDA0xE</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fzreWMDA0xE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 01:19:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From European leaders backing plans for more defense spending to China weathering the tumult of US tariffs, here are some of the stories to lookout for in business and finance in the coming week.

The risk was found to be overhyped – a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale.Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.The rate of false positives, instances when the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What does “PhD-level” AI mean?

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram (trailer) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xydLuigooY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_xydLuigooY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:23:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigate how an online network known as Terrorgram spread extremism and violence.

The links led targeted machines through several intermediary sites until finally arriving at repositories on Microsoft-owned GitHub, which hosted a raft of malicious files.The malware was loaded in four stages, each of which acted as a building block for the next. Early stages collected device information, presumably to tailor configurations for the later ones. Later ones disabled malware detection apps and connected to command-and-control servers; affected devices remained infected even after being rebooted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How CLOSE are we to fusion energy? 😂</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuqA3F-7vpw</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uuqA3F-7vpw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 20:04:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.

Four women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan’s hard-won rights. 

The team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.

ABSTRACT
Several of the leading Continuous Delivery tool vendors have been under attack, including CircleCI, TeamCity and most recently Jenkins. These Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery tools are an important part of the supply chain, and supply chain safety. Supply chain attacks are particularly dangerous, as they may allow attackers to compromise otherwise trusted software at source.

In this episode, Dave Farley explores these recent attacks, and their consequences while describing some of the things that may help you to protect your means of production.

DESCRIPTION
Charles Humble interviews Dr. Gail Murphy about the challenges in software engineering today. They discuss how productivity isn’t just about lines of code but is more about focus and minimizing task-switching.

Gail also talks about the difficulty of managing the rapid evolution of system architectures, stressing the need for regular restructuring and refactoring to avoid issues like increased coupling and decreased performance. The conversation moves to open-source development, where Gail highlights how using open-source components can create complex, brittle dependencies, and the need for better communication within these ecosystems.

They wrap up by discussing the evolving role of technical leadership in navigating these challenges. [...]

When Megan Moroney first showed up for her Tiny Desk, decked out in a blue sequin dress and Uggs, she was fresh off winning best new artist at the Country Music Association Awards, an honor she earned for the affecting ways she blends classic country with earworm pop and confessional storytelling. The blue color scheme, also reflected on her guitar and nail polish, is a nod to the heartache and sadness found across 2024's Am I Okay?

The self-proclaimed Emo Cowgirl opens her Tiny Desk with "I'm Not Pretty" from her 2023 debut Lucky. Backed by pedal steel and sparkling harmonies, she sings about struggles with intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage and peaking in high school. Like all great country music, her songs reveal deeper and universal truths in life's smallest and messiest moments.

But Moroney's music is as much about resilience as it is grief. For this set, she also includes a version of "No Caller ID," which celebrates the friends who help you move on, as well as "Tennessee Orange," her 2022 breakout hit and ode to young love. She closes with the title cut to Am I Okay? "In my discography of sad songs," she tells the NPR Music office, "it's proof that a man was once making me happy." She quickly adds, "It's no longer true, but fun while it lasted!"

Their system tackles some types of abstract pattern-matching tasks using only the puzzles themselves, challenging conventional wisdom about how machine-learning systems acquire problem-solving abilities."Can lossless information compression by itself produce intelligent behavior?" ask Isaac Liao, a first-year PhD student, and his advisor, Professor Albert Gu, from CMU's Machine Learning Department. Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created CompressARC and published the results in a comprehensive post on Liao's website.The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine-learning researcher François Chollet to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills. ARC presents systems with grid-based image puzzles where each provides several examples demonstrating an underlying rule, and the system must infer that rule to apply it to a new example.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Mutual Funds Can Help Grow Your Money in 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GrO0lUAyko</link><author>Dad, how do I?</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0GrO0lUAyko?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 22:30:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw">Dad, how do I?</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, Kids!

(There's a previous front page Show HN about Pipecat, the open source voice AI orchestration framework I work on. [1])It's been almost two years, and for most of that time, I've been expecting that someone would "solve" turn detection. We all built initial, pretty good 80/20 versions of turn detection on top of VAD (voice activity detection) models. And then, as an ecosystem, we kind of got stuck.A few production applications have recently started using Gemini 2.0 Flash to do context aware turn detection. [2] But because latency is ~500ms, that's a more complicated approach than using a specialized model. The team at LiveKit released an open weights model that does text-based turn detection. [3] I was really excited to see that, but I'm not super-optimistic that a text-input model will ever be good enough for this task. (A good rule of thumb in deep learning is that you should bet on end-to-end.)So ... I spent Christmas break training several little proof of concept models, and experimenting with generating synthetic audio data. So, so, so much fun. The results were promising enough that I nerd-sniped a few friends and we started working in earnest on this.The model now performs really well on a subset of turn detection tasks. Too well, really. We're overfitting on a not-terribly-broad initial data set of about 8,000 samples. Getting to this point was the initial bar we set for doing a public release and seeing if other people want to get involved in the project.There are lots of ways to contribute. [4]Medium-term goals for the project are:  - Support for a wide range of languages
  - Inference time of <50ms on GPU and <500ms on CPU
  - Much wider range of speech nuances captured in training data
  - A completely synthetic training data pipeline. (Maybe?)
  - Text conditioning of the model, to support "modes" like credit card, telephone number, and address entry.

If you're interested in voice AI or in audio model ML engineering, please try the model out and see what you think. I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Murder, Drugs &amp; Sex l The Sordid History of 1920’s London</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwdU54XgnAE</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OwdU54XgnAE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 18:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[During the victory celebrations of World War One, a rising star is found dead in her bed after a suspected overdose.

22-year-old Billie Carlton’s death caused shockwaves across the nation, adding fuel to a growing moral panic about sex, scandal and drugs.

Hosts of After Dark, Anthony and Maddy are joined by Virginia Berridge, Professor of History and Health Policy at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, to explore the path to drug criminalisation in postwar London following the death of Billie Carlton. Together, they uncover the extraordinary history of drugs in Soho - London’s most notorious neighbourhood in the 1920s.

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation. Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately 90% of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing Mistral OCR. Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API  at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite la Plateforme, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.State of the art understanding of complex documentsNatively multilingual and multimodalDoc-as-prompt, structured outputSelectively available to self-host for organizations dealing with highly sensitive or classified informationState of the art understanding of complex documentsMistral OCR excels in understanding complex document elements, including interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting. The model enables deeper understanding of rich documents such as scientific papers with charts, graphs, equations and figures. Below is an example of the model extracting text as well as imagery from a given PDF into a markdown file. You can access the notebook here. Below we have side-by-side comparisons of PDFs and their respective OCR's outputs. Hover the slider  to switch between input and output. Mistral OCR has consistently outperformed other leading OCR models in rigorous benchmark tests. Its superior accuracy across multiple aspects of document analysis is illustrated below. We extract embedded images from documents along with text. The other LLMs compared below, do not have that capability. For a fair comparison, we evaluate them on our internal “text-only” test-set containing various publication papers, and PDFs from the web; below:Since Mistral’s founding, we have aspired to serve the world with our models, and consequently strived for multilingual capabilities across our offerings. Mistral OCR takes this to a new level, being able to parse, understand, and transcribe thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents. This versatility is crucial for both global organizations that handle documents from diverse linguistic backgrounds, as well as hyperlocal businesses serving niche markets.Fuzzy Match in GenerationBeing lighter weight than most models in the category, Mistral OCR performs significantly faster than its peers, processing up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node. The ability to rapidly process documents ensures continuous learning and improvement even for high-throughput environments.Doc-as-prompt, structured outputMistral OCR also introduces the use of documents as prompts, enabling more powerful and precise instructions. This capability allows users to extract specific information from documents and format it in structured outputs, such as JSON. Users can chain extracted outputs into downstream function calls and build agents.Available to self-host on a selective basisFor organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, Mistral OCR offers a self-hosting option.

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU’s border protection agency’s reputation. But now, it’s trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.

The message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? 
The new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He’s said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.

--

Two species of Demodex mites specifically inhabit human follicles. And not just some people’s— nearly everyone is thought to host mites. One person’s face might harbor hundreds or even thousands of individual mites. On any given day, these microscopic arachnids are probably eating, mating, and laying eggs inside your pores. So, is this… okay? M. Alejandra Perotti investigates.

That’s not new.

Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

I discuss the pathways through which the brain and body interact to produce thyroid hormone and growth hormone, and how these hormones influence essential processes like tissue growth and repair, body composition, and energy production. I explain how thyroid hormone levels are influenced by key nutrients, such as iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine. I also explain how practices such as exercise, sleep, meditation and sauna can offset age-related declines in growth hormone, to optimize overall hormone health and metabolism. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

DESCRIPTION
Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion have unprecedented potential. Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.

With this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.

Learn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:
• The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between
• How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain
• The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture—and how to best interact with it
• How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code

Today, you will learn why everything you thought about aging is wrong—and how to stay strong, energized, and mobile at any age. 

Dr. Vonda Wright, MD, joins Mel today to give you the wakeup call of a lifetime – one that will teach you how to look, feel, and stay young forever. 

Dr. Wright is a double board-certified orthopedic surgeon and one of the world’s leading experts on mobility, musculoskeletal aging, and longevity. Her pioneering research proves that aging doesn’t mean getting weaker—it means getting smarter about how you move. 
 
You’ll learn: 
Why everything you’ve been told about aging is a lie, and how you can be stronger, healthier, and more energized at any age. 
How to slow aging (and even reverse it) with mobility, muscle-building, and simple daily habits. 
The best exercises for overall health & longevity—and why Dr. Wright says most people focus on the wrong things. 
Why women are often misled about aging—and how to take control of your health before it’s too late. 
What doctors don’t tell you about joint pain, arthritis, and how to fix it. 

Dr. Wright will break down the exercise routine scientifically proven to change the way your body looks and feels, plus a powerful mindset shift that will completely change how you view aging. 

Whether you’re 25 or 65, this episode will give you a science-backed roadmap to staying strong, mobile, and independent for life.

It's about telling a computer what to do and having the computer perform those actions exactly, precisely, and repeatedly. With the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, it's now possible for someone to describe a program in English and have the AI model translate it into working code without ever understanding how the code works. Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy recently gave this practice a name—"vibe coding"—and it's gaining traction in tech circles.The technique, enabled by large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, has attracted attention for potentially lowering the barrier to entry for software creation. But questions remain about whether the approach can reliably produce code suitable for real-world applications, even as tools like Cursor Composer, GitHub Copilot, and Replit Agent make the process increasingly accessible to non-programmers.Instead of being about control and precision, vibe coding is all about surrendering to the flow. On February 2, Karpathy introduced the term in a post on X, writing, "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding,' where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists." He described the process in deliberately casual terms: "I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jocko Podcast 480: Learn To Read, Write, And Think.</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mauwToX2rXk</link><author>Jocko Podcast</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mauwToX2rXk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 23:06:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqcY4CAuBFNFho6JgygCnA">Jocko Podcast</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join Jocko Underground: https://www.jockounderground.com/subscribe

That happened when I started running a simple server from my trusty old Raspberry Pi version 1.I know its local IP address and can  into it easily when I’m home, but when I’m outside, that’s not possible as it’s not exposed to the internet. For that reason, I have used DDNS in the past. The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with  command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.Some additional and surprising benefits:Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for ngrok for. You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. http://my-macbook-air:3000) to effortlessly connect to your development server.Taildrop: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!Exit nodes: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job. With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.Mullvad exit nodes: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the Mullvad partnership, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like iCloud Private Relay. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.Disclaimer: I haven’t yet tried exit nodes or Mullvad integration, so your actual experience may not turn out as I described.I have used Tailscale only for personal reasons so far, using the free tier; they have enterprise plans for enterprise use cases that I have no idea about. I found it useful and wanted to share it in case it helps you too. I wasn’t paid by them, and if you don’t want to use their services for any reason, there’s an open-source server implementation called Headscale, which works with their client software.If you have more use cases, feel free to share them with me!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple takes UK to court over &apos;backdoor&apos; order</title><link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/05/apple_reportedly_ipt_complaint/</link><author>latexr</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 18:07:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Apple has reportedly filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) contesting the British government's order that it must forcibly break the encryption of iCloud data.The appeal will be the first of its kind lodged with the IPT, an independent judicial body that oversees legal complaints against potential unlawful actions by a public authority or UK intelligence services, according to the Financial Times, which broke the news.The revelation follows a battle between the iGadgetmaker and the UK's Home Office, which has long set its sights on Apple's encrypted cloud-hosted data, arguing it needs a backdoor in order for law enforcement to investigate persons of interest.Things came to a head in January when the Home Office issued Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the Investigatory Powers Act, aka the Snooper's Charter, nearly a year after talk of such an order began.Despite being "technical" by name, it's understood that the notice didn't include any technical instructions for Apple, just an order to allow a so-called backdoor into its iCloud network which could be used to gather data that's otherwise typically out of reach of criminal investigators.The Home Office refused to either confirm or deny the existence of the notice when we asked about it, and under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 Apple is prevented from revealing details about the notice.Apple responded by disabling its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for UK users in early February, effectively removing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for data backed up to iCloud to appease the government without fully complying with the TCN.We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never willStill, it means British officials can feasibly sniff around iCloud accounts, provided they get a court-approved warrant to do so. With ADP disabled, various types of user account data – such as iCloud backups, photos, and notes, but not iMessages and health data – stored in Apple's cloud will not be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), meaning the contents can be accessed and provided by Apple to investigators upon legal demand. It will also be done without alerting users, assuming someone involved in the process doesn't leak it at any stage."We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple told  at the time."As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will," it added.The Home Office has also previously voiced its ambition to break E2EE for all popular communications platforms in the UK, such as messaging app WhatsApp, although the case with Apple is believed to be its first foray into handing out TCNs to this end.The UK's entire approach to pressing ahead with the Investigatory Powers Act and its so-called war on encryption has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.Its main arguments in favor of breaking encryption are largely based on the prevention of terror attacks and child sexual exploitation.Security minister Dan Jarvis further justified the powers in Parliament last week, saying requests to access user data under the Act could only be made on an "exceptional basis, and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so."Jarvis's comments came after being questioned by other MPs about the TCN, and seemingly aim to dissuade the public from thinking the government can simply access user data on a whim.The security minister didn't offer much in the way of additional insights, whipping out the good old national security defense as a way to avoid further questioning.Many who argue against the government's ambitions, such as Big Brother Watch, say the action taken against Apple is "outrageous" and "draconian" and may eventually force encrypted messaging technology underground, meaning only criminals would have access to it.US President Donald Trump also recently compared the UK's treatment of Apple to the extensive state surveillance methods deployed by China – the two countries' foremost intelligence adversary.US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has ordered a legal review of the TCN issued to Apple out of concern it could be used to gather data on US citizens. Doing so would violate the terms of the US-UK Cloud Act Agreement, she argued. has asked Apple for further comment. ®Updated to add at 1833 UTCInterestingly enough, the UK government appears to have scrubbed from the web its previous and now politically inconvenient advice to barristers, solicitors, and others in sensitive professions to use Apple's ADP at-rest end-to-end encryption. Fancy that!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Leaflet.pub – a web app for creating and sharing rich documents</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43269928</link><author>jpereira</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:55:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN!For the last 8 months we've been working on leaflet.pub, a web app for making delightful documents. We're trying to strike a balance between Notion and Google Docs — very fast, ultralight and easy to share, but also supporting rich blocks and multiple pages.Weirdly, none of the many notetaking/document apps that we could find hit this combination, so we made Leaflet. With it you can:- Instantly create a doc, without an account
- Share read and edit links
- Sign-in with email to sync your docs to different devices
- Add rich blocks, like canvases, subpages, rsvps, and pollsIt's really useful for one-off collaborations, running events, or just when you need a blank page without having to buy into a whole organizational system.We also spent a lot of time making sure Leaflets look good. We've found that there's a pretty blurry boundary between a document and a website, so making something that people can feel proud to publish online was key.Here's a couple examples!Some technical details that might be interesting:- We do sync and all our client-side state via Replicache, which I really love!
- Data is modeled as a set of facts about entities, a la Datomic, forming a graph. This has been flexible enough for us to quickly build new features, like canvases and nested pages, without committing to a single document structure.
- We use ProseMirror, but not for the entire document. Instead every text block is a separate ProseMirror instance. This lets us keep the document structure in our database and our schema, without having to dive into ProseMirror's every time we want to modify things.- Better home and document organizing features — things like search, tagging, collections etc.
- We're really excited about ATProto and Bluesky and are working on a set of lexicons and an AppView for document publishing! This will include a lexicon for rich text documents, as well as one publications, and some concept of memberships or subscriptions.
- More blocks! Tables, code blocks, etc.Some things we're particularly proud of:- Our list handling
- Custom theming
- Keyboard handling on iOS Safari (and generally works excellently on mobile)
- Side-scrolling multi-page interface
- Works as a PWA!Some things that still need work:- While faster than others, still a lot of work we can do on performance, both speed when working with very large documents and loading docs generally
- Drag and drop and selection in general could be a lot nicer
- Keyboard navigation across multiple pages
- Multiplayer cursors, and generally real-time sync could be sped up greatly leveraging CRDTs (we already use YJS, just could move updates around faster)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unification Wars Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-dunan-unification-wars-review/1900-6418342/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Heidi Kemps</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/43/434805/4454240-newproject.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:41:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Before Final Fantasy VII took RPGs as a whole into the mainstream, Suikoden made its mark as one of the first quality role-playing titles released outside of Japan on PlayStation. The game's main conceit was based loosely on the Chinese literary classic The Water Margin: A young outcast and his friends gather up companions to form the 108 Stars of Destiny, building a magnificent rebel outpost and eventually toppling a wicked empire. Suikoden's success would inspire multiple sequels, including immediate follow-up Suikoden II, regarded by many as a shining gem in the PS1's RPG library.With fame and acclaim, however, comes a price tag: Original copies of Suikoden II run in the hundreds of dollars, and that's even with several well-known, game-breaking bugs that were inadvertently introduced in the English version. Here's where Konami seemingly swoops in to the rescue, offering both Suikoden I and II together for a low price and promising beautiful new HD graphics and bonus features. This was announced back in 2022, and now, two and a half years later due to delays, we finally have Suikoden I&II HD Remaster--and I'm left wondering just how all that time this remaster spent cooking in the oven was spent.First, let's talk a bit about the games themselves. I first played both of these titles back on the PS1 many years ago. The original Suikoden was the game I was most excited to revisit, as it had been well over two decades since I'd last played it, and I'd forgotten so much about it. I was pleased to rediscover a pleasant, breezy RPG with a fast-paced story, smooth turn-based combat, and a charming sense of humor. It's quite short, and with the lack of load times and addition of battle speed-up options, you can easily finish it in around 15-20 hours doing all of the optional content.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Be a Lifelong Learner!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYhWKw-ti4</link><author>Dad, how do I?</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bAYhWKw-ti4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:31:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw">Dad, how do I?</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey Kids! 👋🏻👋🏻

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Flying Taxi eVTOLs Might Not Fly Directly From A to B</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzooJ9SfkaA</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IzooJ9SfkaA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:00:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Flying taxis have the potential to help passengers skip congestion by zipping across the skies from A to B.

This special forest is home to countless spruce and fir trees. One very special species towers above them all, giving many animals shelter: the giant arbor vitae, or ‘Tree of Life’.

The proud giant, which can live for up to a thousand years, plays an important role in the mythology of the Nuxalk. These indigenous people communicate with their ancestors through the tree. But the tree of life also plays a key role in the ecosystem and is home to numerous species - from the smallest insects to stately mammals. The animals crawl into its trunk or find shelter under its bushy foliage. 

The giant arbor vitae has watched over the Canadian rainforest and the adjacent ocean for thousands of years. Every fall, the salmon return to their native rivers in the middle of the Great Bear Rainforest after spending several years at sea. They fight their way upstream to spawn - and provide a feast for the bears, who devour the delicious fish in the shade of the trees. 
Nothing is lost in the forest. Scavengers feed on any remains left among the tree roots and whatever is left nourishes the rich forest soil with nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, even the salmon promote tree growth and contribute to a unique ecosystem. 

Forest and ocean live in symbiosis here. When heavy rainfall erodes the soil, nutrients are transported through the rivers to the sea, where they benefit the humpback whales. Nowadays, however, this complex ecosystem is threatened by massive logging. Here, too, humans are jeopardizing a balance that has existed for thousands of years.

ABSTRACT
New web libraries constantly emerge, promising to solve our previous coding dilemmas. But what if we revisit the fundamentals? Embrace simplicity and speed using Vanilla JS, modern browser APIs, and different server architectures, including site generators.

Let’s talk about embracing the simplicity and speed of development that comes with a ‘vanilla’ approach.

This session is all about exploring how to craft rich web apps and websites using nothing but the HTTP protocol, core JavaScript, and browser APIs—no dependencies, just pure power! If you have never created apps with Vanilla JS or without a library, now is the perfect time to understand it.

We’ll journey through the modern landscape of JavaScript’s foundational features, which have evolved into a robust suite of tools. From Web Components to Shadow DOM, reactivity and declarative templates, PWA APIs, reactive programming, and client-side routing, we’ll uncover how to harness these powerful features typically provided by libraries.

We’ll also delve into server-side architectures and how to use static site generators for some websites and web apps.

Let’s rediscover the potential of returning to the roots of web development and see what your code can do without libraries or frameworks! [...]

But this isn’t just a story about technology—it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).

For a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now—about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do—are already changing the world.
The people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next – or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as “the magic intelligence in the sky.” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.

But whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

Of the 30 million people who have watched Daniel Caesar's Tiny Desk from 2018, plenty of them raved about the band, specifically the bass player. Little did we know that the young, unassuming musician named Saya Gray would be playing at the Desk seven years later, this time front and center.

Gray's pop songs are experimental in nature, so I was eager to hear how her music would cozy up to our space. That inclination to stretch out and try anything comes from her musical family: Her mother, who moved from Japan to Canada, founded Toronto's Discover Through the Arts music school, and her dad, a jazz trumpeter, studied at the Berklee College of Music.

Gray leans into the challenge of the Tiny Desk and strips elements away. Like magic, she gives us these light and soulful interpretations of songs from SAYA, plus a throwback to "IF THERE'S NO SEAT IN THE SKY (WILL YOU FORGIVE ME???)" from her 2022 debut, 19 MASTERS.

SET LIST
"SHELL ( OF A MAN )"
"..THUS IS WHY ( I DON'T SPRING 4 LOVE )"
"IF THERE'S NO SEAT IN THE SKY (WILL YOU FORGIVE ME???)"
"LIE DOWN.."

Secrets from the massively popular Stanford business school course on interpersonal hygiene.

Carole Robin and David Bradford taught the most popular elective course at the Stanford Graduate School of Business for a combined total of 75 years. Officially, the name of the course is Interpersonal Dynamics, but everybody calls it “Touchy-Feely.” Together they have written the new book, Connect: Building Exceptional Relationships with Family, Friends, and Colleagues.

We dive into the six hallmarks of what they call “exceptional relationships,” how to be honest and vulnerable without overdoing it, why the questions “how am I feeling?” and “how are you feeling?” are central to improving our communication, the inevitability of risk when you set out to deepen a relationship, and why meditation is helpful in all of this.

This episode originally aired in 2021.

"I'm almost a bit worried I will start feeling emotionally attached to a voice assistant with this level of human-like sound."In late February, Sesame released a demo for the company's new Conversational Speech Model (CSM) that appears to cross over what many consider the "uncanny valley" of AI-generated speech, with some testers reporting emotional connections to the male or female voice assistant ("Miles" and "Maya").]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I Built a Telegraph Simulator</title><link>https://telegraph.13ug1mb.com/</link><author>leugim</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Romans: The Rise &amp; Fall Of The Greatest Warriors Of The Ancient World</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28mILhoIJII</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/28mILhoIJII?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Roman army was unequaled in success, counting its Byzantine offspring over two millennia. The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.

Virtual machines often run inside hosting environments to prevent one customer from being able to access or control the resources of other customers. By breaking out of one customer’s isolated VM environment, a threat actor could take control of the hypervisor that apportions each VM. From there, the attacker could access the VMs of multiple customers, who often use these carefully controlled environments to host their internal networks.“If you can escape to the hypervisor you can access every system,” security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Mastodon. “If you can escape to the hypervisor, all bets are off as a boundary is broken.” He added: “With this vuln you’d be able to use it to traverse VMware managed hosting providers, private clouds orgs have built on prem etc.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dave Episode 1 Anniversary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMkZQVvXwBU</link><author>Lil Dicky</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dMkZQVvXwBU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 21:14:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8rVJyj4zE0S9-sccMLifIA">Lil Dicky</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[5 years ago on this date exactly, this pilot episode of TV aired and changed my life forever!!!

These establishments were especially important for those who didn’t have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.

We visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.

More on Ancient Roman Fast Food
Shopping at outdoor markets, like the Campo de' Fiori in Rome, was also a major part of daily life. Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.

For those who couldn’t afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas—multi-story buildings in Rome—relied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.

Fish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Do we expect too much from people? #podcast #melrobbins #jayshetty</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRrdQdenpNQ</link><author>Jay Shetty Podcast</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PRrdQdenpNQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 20:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbk_QsfaFZG6PdQeCvaYXJQ">Podcast - Jay Shetty - On Purpose</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Episode Resources:

It was the computer I always wanted as a teenager but could never afford. Words cannot do justice
to the joy I felt while working on this machine.As soon as I got something able to boot, I benchmarked the one software I wanted to run.
C:\DOOM>doom.exe -timedemo demo1
timed 1710 gametics in 2783 realtics  
Doom doesn't give the fps right away. You have to do a bit of math to get the framerate. In this instance, that's 1710/2783*35 =  fps. An honorable performance for the best machine money could (reasonably) buy in Dec 1993 (specs, chipset, video, disk1, disk2, speedsys).I was resigned to playing under Ibuprofen until I heard of fastDOOM. I am usually not a fan of ports
  because they tend to add features without cohesion (except for the dreamy Chocolate DOOM) but I gave it a try out of curiosity.
C:\DOOM>fdoom.exe -timedemo demo1
Timed 1710 gametics in 1988 realtics. FPS: 30% faster without cutting any features! On a demanding map like doom2's demo1, the gain is even higher, from  fps to  fps. That is 48% faster!I did not suspect that DOOM had left that much on the table. Obviously shipping within one year left little time to optimize. I had to understand how this magic trick happened.Before digging into fastDOOM, let's understand where the code comes from. DOOM was originally developed on NeXT Workstation. The game was structured to be easy to port with most of the code in a core surrounded by small sub-systems performing I/O.During development, DOS I/Os were written by id Software. This became the commercial release of DOOM.
But that version could not be open sourced in 1997 because it relied on a proprietary sound library called DMX.What ended up being open sourced was the linux version, cleaned up by Bernd Kreimeier when he was working on a book project to explain the engine.A DOS version of DOOM was reconstructed by using linux's core, Heretic I/O, and APODMX (Apogee Sound wrapper) to emulate DMX. 
  Because Heretic used video mode 13h while DOOM used video mode Y, the graphic I/O ()
was reverse-engineered from  disassembly. That is how the community got PCDOOM v2.fastDOOM starting point was PCDOOM v2.                    ┌───────────────┐

──────────────────The big performance pictureVictor "Viti95" Nieto, wrote release notes to describe the performance improvement of each version but he seemed more interested in making  awesome than detailing how he did it.To get the big picture of performance evolution over time, I downloaded all 52 releases of fastDOOM, PCDOOMv2, and the original , wrote a go program to generate a  running  on all of them, and mounted it all with mTCP's .I chose to timedemo  with sound on and screen size = 10 (fullscreen with status bar). After several hours of shotguns and imps agony, I had run the whole suite five times and graphed the average fps with .The first thing this graph allows to rule out is that fastDOOM improvements were mostly due to using a modern compiler.  is built with OpenWatcom 2 but only gets a marginal improvement over .On top of releasing often, Viti95 displayed outstanding git discipline where one commit does one thing and each release was tagged. fastDOOM git history is made of 3,042 commits which allows to benchmark each feature.I wrote another go program to build every single commit. I will pass on the gory details of handling the many build system changes (especially from DOS to Linux). After an hour I had the
  most ugly program I ever wrote and 3,042 . I was pleased to see the build was almost never broken.Graphing the files size shows that the early effort was to be lean by cleaning and deleting code. There are major drops with bf0e983 
  (build 239 where sound recording was removed), 5f38323
  (build 0340 where error code strings were deleted), 
  and 8b9cac5
   (build 1105 where TASM was replaced with NASM).
 Timedemoing all builds would have taken a very long time (3042x1.5/60/24 * 3 passes = 9 days) so I focused
on the release where most of the speed was gained. I wrote yet another go program to generate a  file running timedemo for all commits in , , , , and .

Chart is click-able and mouseover-ableThe MVP (Most Valuable Player) patch of v0.1 is without a doubt build 36 (e16bab8). The "Crispy optimization" turns status bar percentage rendering into a noop if they have not changed. This prevents rendering to a scrap buffer and blitting to the screen for a total
of 2 fps boost. At first I could not believe it. I assume my toolchain had a bug. But cherry-picking this patch on PCDOOMv2 confirmed the tremendous speed gain.Next is build 167 (a9359d5)
which inlines FixedDiv via macro.Near the end, we see a series of optimizations granting 0.5 fps.9bd3f20): A PSX Doom optimization which optimizes the way the BSP is traversed.

Build 212 (dc0f48e) "Inlined R_MakeSpans" which renders horizontal surfaces.Overall this version saw a lot of code being deleted (50% of commits were deletions) which probably helped to cuddle the 486 cachelines of my machine.git log --reverse --oneline "0.1" | grep -i -E "remove|delete" | wc -l

The sound system was a bit unstable so I had to timedemo without sound and then normalize the fps. 
  Moreover the focus of v0.8 seems to have been text-mode renderer so two regressions happened at Build 670

optimization that did not work on my machine (worse performances) was to use video mode 13h instead of mode Y.In mode 13h dispatch of data toward the four VRAM banks of the VGA is done in hardware. To the CPU, the VRAM appears like a single linear 320x200 framebuffer.
The inconvenience is that you can't double buffer in VRAM so you have to do it in RAM which means bytes are written twice. First into the framebuffer in RAM. And then
a second time when sent to VRAM. Also, the engine must block on VSYNC.Mode 13h

The mode-Y lets programmers access the VGA banks individually. This allows triple-buffering in VRAM. Moreover, it has the advantage of writing bytes once, directly into
 VRAM. The target bank must be manually selected by the developer via very slow  instructions
 but that allows to duplicating pixels horizontally (which gives low-detail mode for free) by writing to two VGA banks at once via latches. Another inconvenience is that it makes drawing invisible Specter much slower since it requires reading back from the VRAM.Mode Y

For machines with fast CPUs and bus (100+ Mhz/ Pentium and VLB/PCI) where video cards are less likely to handle  instruction well, mode 13h is better. 
For "slow CPUs", it is faster to write data once to VRAM via mode Y.Anyway, Doom used mode Y.
       DOOM uses 320*200*256 VGA mode, which is slightly different from MCGA
mode (it would NOT run on an MCGA equiped machine). I access the
frame buffer in an interleaved planar mode similar to Michael
Abrash's "Mode X", but still at 200 scan lines instead of 240 (less
pixels == faster update rate).
DOOM cycles between three display pages. If only two were used, it
would have to sync to the VBL to avoid possible display flicker. If
you look carefully at a HOM effect, you should see three distinct
images being cycled between.Another reason John game me for using Mode-Y back in the days is that the tools used by the graphic team (Deluxe Paint) only supported 320x200 (whereas Mode-X is 320x240).
Low detail is 160*200 in the view screen. This is done by setting
two bits in the mapmask register whenever the texturing functions are
writing to video memory, causing two pixels to be set for each byte
written.

Its planar, but not bit planar (THAT would stink). Pixels 0,4,8 are
in plane 0, pixels 1,5,9 are in plane 1, etc.

The registers don't need to be programed all that much. The map mask
register only needs to be set once for each vertical column, and four
times for each horizontal row (I step by four pixels in the inner
loop to stay on the same plane, then increment the start pixel and
move to the next plane).

It is still a lot of grief, and it polutes the program quite a bit,
but texture mapping directly to the video memory gives you a fair
amount of extra speed (10% - 15%) on most video cards because the
video writes are interleaved with main memory accesses and texture
calculations, giving the write time to complete without stalling.

Going to that trouble also gets a perfect page flip, rather than the
tearing you get with main memory buffering.Heretic was released in 1994. Hardware had evolved to make mode 13h  more appealing so Raven modified the DOOM engine to this effect. 
  PCDoom v2 used Heretic I/O but re-implemented the video I/O with mode Y. 
  Finally fastDOOM gives users the choice by providing several executable , , and .
  
The DOOM press release beta (October '93) used Mode 13h, so I assume they switched to Mode Y to improve performance on slower machines (low-detail). I wonder why they didn’t also implement the so-called "potato mode", which writes four pixels with a single 8-bit write to VRAM.

In FastDoom, I reintroduced Mode 13h because Heretic/Hexen had better-optimized ASM rendering code for this mode. Later, I was able to partially port this approach to column rendering in Mode Y, which resulted in a 5% to 7% performance improvement.

Based on my testing, the best mode for 486 CPUs is the VESA direct mode (FDOOMVBD.EXE for 320x200). This mode combines the advantages of Mode Y with the optimized rendering code from Heretic while avoiding any OUT instructions—except for one to switch buffers, which executes only once per rendered frame. The only downside is that it requires a VLB or PCI graphics card with LFB enabled and has slower performance in low-detail and potato-detail modes.- Conversation with Viti95Note that both  and  require support for VESA 2.0 which my IBM 2168 does not have. Attempting to run these results in errors (FDOOMVBD.BMP, FDOOMVBR.BMP).
In FastDoom, Mode 13h uses a single framebuffer in RAM, which is copied to VRAM after the entire scene is rendered. Vsync is not enforced, which may result in flickering. There are two methods for copying the backbuffer to VRAM, optimized for different bus speeds. For slow buses (8-bit ISA), a differential copy method is used, transferring only modified pixels.

This approach involves many branches but is faster overall because branching is less expensive than excessive bus transfers. For faster buses (16-bit ISA, VLB, PCI, etc.), a full backbuffer copy is performed using REP MOVS instructions, which is efficient when the bus bandwidth is sufficient.
- Conversation with Viti95More optimization which did not workAnother venue I appreciated seeing explored is OpenWatcom's processor-specific flags (/ vs /). Both wcc386's 386 and 486 flags were attempted but ultimately discontinued
  because the 386 version always seemed faster.
One of my goals for FastDoom is to switch the compiler from OpenWatcom v2 to DJGPP (GCC), which has been shown to produce faster code with the same source. Alternatively, it would be great if someone could improve OpenWatcom v2 to close the performance gap.
 - Conversation with Viti95What splendid work by Victor Nieto!
 If software can die from a thousand cuts, Viti95 made fastDOOM awesome with three thousand optimizations! 
  Not only he leveraged existing improvements (crispy, psx, gba, Lee Killough), he also came up with many news one
and generated so much hype that even Ken Silverman (author of Duke3D build engine) came to participate.
 I tip my beret to you Victor!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>World Engineering Day Focuses on Shaping a Sustainable Future</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/world-engineering-day-sustainable-future</link><author>San Murugesan</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjYzMDY0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDcxNDQ2MH0.uAFBdVpfclBhNE847cT-mt9smiD7HeCX_cEM5YGVL_Q/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It highlights the role engineers play in fostering sustainability]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neil &amp; a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kf4NyRbvkmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 18:54:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

We begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.

Fusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches—from Princeton’s tokamak designs to Livermore’s laser-driven experiments—and why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.

But fusion isn’t just about energy—it’s also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.

Finally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs? All this and more in a charged-up episode of StarTalk!

The World Food Programme says nearly 25 million people are facing acute food shortages - all driven by a war that has received little international attention.

Aid organizations warn that the dimension of the crisis surpasses those in Ukraine, Gaza and Somalia combined. The conflict has been running since 2023, pitting army chief and de facto president Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan against his former deputy Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The fighting has displaced 12 million people, roughly a quarter of the population. Yet, the crisis is barely present in the international media. That’s partly because journalists are rarely given access to the war zone. But DW correspondent Mariel Müller managed to secure permission to film from the Sudanese army. Embedded with military forces, she traveled to the capital Khartoum, where the paramilitary RSF control swathes of territory and the battle for dominance continues to rage - leaving the civilian population trapped in the crossfire. And the conflict shows no signs of ending soon.

Climate change, droughts, and unchecked urban growth have pushed this high-tech metropolis to the brink.  

But Bengaluru isn't alone. Beijing, Mexico City, Barcelona, Melbourne, and Cape Town are among 10 megacities that could be close to Day Zero—the critical point when a city or region's water reserves reach such low levels that the taps run dry. With global warming intensifying, cities everywhere are undergoing a stress test for survival.  

However, in Bengaluru's case, experts believe that water literacy—understanding and managing water better—can help secure the city’s future.  

Are there community-led initiatives to save water where you live?

--

Achinpur was on the precipice of demonic takeover. A mysterious woman beguiled the king and infiltrated the royal family. But she wasn’t human; under her beautiful façade lurked an insatiable appetite for flesh. One night, the demon queen devoured the king's sons — but the princes managed to evade death. Malay Bera shares the tale of their quest to free the kingdom from the scourge of demons.

Lesson by Malay Bera, directed by Ahmad Thabit, Samaka Studio.

Although this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, "Neelkamal and Lalkamal",  from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.

It's the type of game that will have you setting your controller aside to wipe away tears, both of laughter and raw emotion, as well as to call literally everyone in close proximity to come see whatever dark, hilarious, referential, or mind-blowing thing just happened. As such, I've spent the better part of the past week impatiently waiting for this embargo to drop--for the second I could talk about it with someone other than the close friend I roped into joining me. In short, Split Fiction is one of the most memorable, brilliant, and spectacular games I've ever played. And at long last, I am allowed to tell about it.With Split Fiction, Hazelight Studios solidifies itself as not only one of the most clever and innovative working studios, but as one eager to grow and utterly devoted to creativity as both an idea and act. Though Hazelight has yet to release anything less than great, it was almost shocking to see how much it had learned from--and improved upon--2021's critical darling It Takes Two. Levels and environments are vast, gorgeous, and varied; our two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are full of depth, charm, and personality; the game's seemingly endless gimmicks and gameplay mechanics, all of which are introduced at far more rapid pace than It Takes Two, are nearly all so fun, brilliant, and tightly designed that they could stand alone; and its writing, plot beats, and overall structure deliver a remarkable story that rappels from heart wrenching, commentative, darkly humorous, and brimming with joy just as fluidly as our heroines grapple-hook between buildings. Though there is a level of cheesiness that coats the game's overarching story and its primary antagonist, Rader, as a whole Split Fiction is a marvelous game that sets a new benchmark not only for Hazelight, but for co-op experiences as a whole.Despite its inevitable greatness, Split Fiction kicks off with a humble (if slightly cliched) beginning in which it introduces its protagonists: Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster. Mio and Zoe are nothing alike. Whereas Mio is an angsty, city-slicking, sci-fi enthusiast who'd sooner yank out her own tooth than open up to a stranger, the fantasy-loving Zoe is sunshine incarnate. And yet, the pair does share one thing in common: They are both unpublished writers in dire need of money and a byline.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Appstat – Process Monitor for Windows</title><link>https://pragmar.com/appstat/</link><author>pragmar</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 15:24:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and thread metrics in real-time for running applications.

The industry has evolved significantly from its notoriously scammy origins, having much higher standards and using more flexible points-based systems. Executives say the bait-and-switch days are behind timeshares and have rebranded them as “vacation clubs,” offering a wide range of accommodations and experiences. But there are still issues and scams to look out for when getting into a timeshare. 

WSJ explores how timeshares became a $35.7 billion dollar industry, how they work and how issues still persist in the industry.

DESCRIPTION
Adrienne Braganza, author of "Looks Good to Me: Constructive Code Reviews", and Saša Jurić, author of “Elixir in Action”, explore best practices for effective code reviews. They discuss how smaller, well-organized pull requests lead to better feedback, the importance of comment classification, and when to take discussions offline. Both emphasize that code reviews aren't just about catching bugs—they're crucial for knowledge transfer and creating cohesive codebases.

While AI tools can help with routine aspects, human judgment remains essential, especially as AI-generated code becomes more common. The speakers agree that when done well, code reviews become one of the most valuable practices in software development.

Has the invention of modern medicine and technology meant that survival of the fittest is a thing of the past? Or are humans evolving new adaptations (better thumbs for texting anyone?) that will help us cope and survive better in our ever changing world?

If evolution happens over 1000's of years, could we even tell if we were evolving as a species, or have humans reached peak human?

The ports collection will download the KSH source code, compile it, and install it on the system. The pkg method is easier, and it will download a pre-compiled binary package. Hence, it is recommended for all users. KornShell (KSH) has a long history, and many older Unix systems and scripts rely on it. As a result, KSH remains relevant for maintaining and supporting legacy infrastructure. Large enterprises, especially those with established Unix-based systems, continue to use KSH for scripting and system administration tasks. Some industries where KSH is still commonly used include finance and telecommunications. While Bash has become the dominant shell in many Linux distributions, KSH still holds a significant presence in Unix-like environments, particularly in legacy systems. Therefore, installing KSH and practicing with it is worthwhile if you plan to work in such environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Worst Thing To Do On Someone’s Birthday 😳</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziwrJA4ztdI</link><author>Can I Vibe With Y&apos;all Podcast</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ziwrJA4ztdI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 23:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3e_jup9vZsAD1keIkZ51A">Podcast - Can I Vibe with Y&apos;all</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers surprised to find less-educated areas adopting AI writing tools faster</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-surprised-to-find-less-educated-areas-adopting-ai-writing-tools-faster/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/virtual_typewriter_hero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 22:32:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, experts have debated how widely AI language models would impact the world.

Here’s a walkthrough of how it works: https://youtu.be/kby2Wdt2Dtk?si=59xGCDy48Zzwr7ND.1. An agents.json file describes how to link API calls together into outcome-based tools for LLMs. This file sits alongside an OpenAPI file.2. The agents.json SDK loads agents.json files as tools for an LLM that can then be executed as a series of API calls.Why is this worth building?
Developers are realizing that to use tools with their LLMs in a stateless way, they have to implement an API manually to work with LLMs. We see devs sacrifice agentic, non-deterministic behavior for hard-coded workflows to create outcomes that can work. agents.json lets LLMs be non-deterministic for the outcomes they want to achieve and deterministic for the API calls it takes to get there.We’ve put together some real examples if you're curious what the final output looks like. Under the hood, these LLMs have the same system prompt and we plug in a different agents.json to give access to different APIs. It’s all templatized.We really wanted to solve real production use cases, and knew this couldn’t just be a proxy. Our approach allows you to make API calls from your own infrastructure. The open-source specification + runner package make this paradigm possible. Agents.json is truly stateless; the client manages all memory/state and it can be deployed on existing infra like serverless environments.You might be wondering -  Why can’t I just put that in the LLM’s context?We thought so too, at first, when building an agent with access to Gmail. But putting the API spec into LLM context gave us poor accuracy in tool selection and in tool calling. Even with cutting down our output space to 5-10 endpoints, we’d see the LLMs fail to select the right tool. We wanted the LLM to just work given an outcome rather than having it reason each time which series of API calls to make.The Gmail API, for example, has endpoints to search for threads, list the emails in a thread, and reply with an email given base64 RFC 822 content. All that has to happen in order with the right arguments for our agent to reply to a thread. We found that APIs are designed for developers, not for LLMs.So we implemented agents.json. It started off as a config file we were using internally that we slowly started adding features to like auth registration, tool search, and multiple API sources. 3 weeks ago, Dharmesh (CTO of Hubspot) posted about the concept of a specification that could translate APIs for LLMs. It sounded a lot like what we already had working internally and we decided to make it open source. We built agents.json for ourselves but we’re excited to share it.In the weeks since we’ve put it out there, agents.json has 10 vetted API integrations (some of them official) and more are being added every day. We recently made the tool search and custom collection platform free for everyone so it’s even easier for devs to scale the number of tools. (https://wild-card.ai)Please tell us what you think! Especially if you’re building agents or creating APIs!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mia&apos;s short life: When a child dies | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejrEsjYGOXU</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ejrEsjYGOXU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 17:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mia was born healthy but was suddenly rushed to the hospital, where it was revealed that she has a terminal congenital genetic disorder.

.
The reported Thermal State is  when the iPad is not heating, 
when the iPad started to heat and  when the iPad was hurting to touch.
I defintely had the iPad heating more than  on other occurrences.The response to this post has been overwhelming, with sharing on
Hacker News and
Reddit.
It's clear that many others are experiencing frustrations with Apple's
software, indicating quality issue within Apple's OSes portfolio.To provide more context, here's the workflow that triggers these issues:
I create a new note at the start of each lecture, add a title and tags
for organization, and begin writing with my Apple Pencil Pro.The issues manifest after filling roughly one page (or "screen")
with handwritten notes. The iPad here starts to overheat, and lag spikes become
increasingly frequent.As a long-time Apple user, I've always appreciated the integration of
hardware and software, signature of the Apple ecosystem. However, recent
experiences with my iPad Air 11" M2 has left me questioning whether
Apple has lost sight of what once made their products great.: Visited the Apple Store in Turin with my then new iPad
Air 11" M2 experiencing significant lag and overheating when using Notes and
Freeform with Apple Pencil Pro.: Received a replacement unit after store
representatives suggested a hardware swap.: The replacement unit is now having identical
performance issues.Premium Hardware, Struggling SoftwareIn November, I visited the Apple Store in Turin to address persistent issues
with my iPad Air 11" M2 running iPadOS 18.1. Despite having cutting-edge
hardware, I've been experiencing significant lag when using  Apple
applications like Notes and Freeform.The performance issues don't stop at sluggish response times. During these
use cases, my iPad overheated, making it uncomfortable to
hold or even rest the palm on, raising concerns about potential long-term
hardware damage.What made this particularly frustrating is that these aren't third-party
applications pushing the hardware to its limits. These are Apple's own
applications that should be  optimized for their hardware.After demonstrating the issues in person to Apple Store staff (that were
courteous and professional), the support representative that was handling my
case suggested a hardware replacement.However, after further discussion, we
both concluded this was likely a software problem rather than a
hardware defect.I think this highlights a growing challenge for Apple's support model:
how do you troubleshoot software issues when the traditional solution has been
to replace hardware?I think this experience feels symptomatic of a broader decline in Apple's
software quality.My replacement iPad Air 11" M2 with the Apple Pencil Pro is once again
struggling with the same basic tasks. Despite multiple iPadOS updates since my
original complaint (we're now on 18.3.1), the fundamental issues remain:Significant lag when using Apple's own Notes and Freeform applications:
Input latency increases dramatically after about 5-10 minutes of use, with
stroke rendering delayed by up to 5 seconds;Device overheating during standard usage scenarios: CPU temperatures
reach concerning levels (based on device's external heat) during pencil
input;Poor responsiveness with the Apple Pencil Pro: Palm rejection fails
intermittently, and pressure and roll sensitivity becomes inconsistent.This recurrence with a replacement device (and other friend's iPads) confirms
what I and the support representative suspected last November - this is a
software optimization problem, not a hardware defect.Since my original complaint, I've discovered
numerous forum threads
and social media discussions from iPad users experiencing similar issues. This
suggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.I think these are sympthoms of two main problems:Thermal Management Issues: The SoC should throttle performance
before reaching high external temperatures;Memory Management Problems: The gradual degradation in performance makes
me think of memory leaks or improper garbage collection in Apple's Note and
Freeform applications.Most concerning is that multiple software updates have failed to address these
performance issues while introducing new features that add more strain to the
system (like Apple Intelligence, but that's a story for another day).Reconsidering the "Apple Tax"For years, many of us have willingly paid the "Apple tax", the premium price
for Apple products justified by superior user experience, design, and ecosystem
integration. But if software quality continues to decline, this value
proposition becomes increasingly difficult to defend.The persistence of these issues through multiple software updates suggests:Feature prioritization over optimization: Engineering resources appear
focused on adding new capabilities rather than fixing existing performance
problems;Inadequate performance testing: Real-world usage scenarios with Apple's
own applications aren't being adequately tested.As customers paying premium prices for Apple products, we at least deserve:: Acknowledgment of known performance issues;: Updates focused on performance and stability;: Consideration for extended warranties when software
issues impact hardware lifespan.The Apple experience was once defined by the words "it just works".Today, that promise feels hollow as software struggles to keep pace with
hardware capabilities. As users and customers, we need to vocally advocate for
the quality-focused Apple we once knew.After months of hoping for improvement, I'm faced with difficult decisions
about my future in the Apple ecosystem. This issue, along with several others,
albeit smaller, ones, has severely damaged my confidence in new Apple products.Apple should return to its roots - creating products that prioritize user
experience over feature . Apple needs to reclaim that ethos.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Opening Races That Caused Huge Drama</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk-dU3ZbMMM</link><author>FORMULA 1</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uk-dU3ZbMMM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 16:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_qr75-ydFVKSF9Dmo6izg">FORMULA 1</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The F1 season opener has the potential to produce some incredible action, as new drivers look to impress and even the grid's mainstays get used to new machinery.

Their anonymous critics conduct systematic reviews of establishments across France (and now Belgium), documenting their findings in a witty - if peculiar - style. Beyond choosing the place for a delicious night out, they can be used to map and understand France’s culinary network.A network is composed of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities, such as people or restaurants. Edges represent the relationships between people and restaurants, or absence thereof. For the French restaurant scene, nodes represent both people and restaurants. A person node is connected to a restaurant if that person is known to have worked at the restaurant.Restaurants with very many neighbor nodes (nodes connected to it) are restaurants whose alumni go on to create and work in other prestigious restaurants. This is the case of Ducasse (ok, not a restaurant but a placeholder for all the restaurants in the Ducasse brand), Mandarin Oriental (technically the restaurant is called Sur Mesure) or Septime.To visualize and analyse this network, I combine information contained in reviews of restaurants across France by LeFooding.com’s critics. Most reviews contain information about the staff and their CV.Take this (shortened) review of Grenat (emphasis mine):À l’enseigne de Grenat,  et  ont le rouge aux joues et aux murs. Après avoir officié à La Brasserie Communale, où ils se sont rencontrés, les deux compères font désormais feu de tout bois en plein centre de Marseille, où Antoine veille au grain autour des tables en bois blond, convoyant les plats que Neil embrase à tout-va depuis l’âtre derrière le comptoir. Des huîtres aux pièces viandardes, […]and LeFooding.com’s English version:At Grenat,  and  are bathed in an ardent red glow, much like the pomegranate-toned walls of their space. After working together at La Brasserie Communale, where they first met, the duo is now firing on all cylinders in the heart of Marseille, where Antoine tends to guests seated around blonde wood tables, delivering dishes ignited by Neil behind the bar. From oysters to prime cuts of red meat, […]Notice that the review mentions the restaurant staff, their prior experience at  and gives their roles in the restaurant. All of this information should be included in the network. Using OpenAI’s gpt4o-mini model with its structured generation functionality, I can extract information from the 1800 publicly available LeFooding.com reviews going back four years. Instead of the order of 1800 “current” staff-restaurant relationships, I uncovered over 5000 links, enriching our analysis with all possible information from the reviews.I combined the extracted information into a graph you can explore below (or click here) below. To get started in exploring look for , Antoine, Neil or  and other restaurants I’ve mentioned. The network has over 5000 nodes and as many edges. In the visualization, green nodes represent staff and purple nodes represent restaurants. Larger nodes have a higher degree (more neighbors). Edges link restaurants and staff. You can it below. Look for your favorite restaurant, or click around to discover the connected components in the graph.To get here, I scraped data from LeFooding.com, extracted the desired information from the reviews, built the graph and finally made the visualization. The code used is available at theophilec/foudinge.The crux of the approach is extracting the information is a structured way. Indeed, I need an easy was of building the graph and knowing which restaurants and people are related. Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent in understanding a text, and can answer questions like “Where did Antoine Joannier work before Grenat?” with the Grenat review. However, if we ask for the information is a structured format like a JSON object, they struggle to reliably give useful answers.For instance, the desired output for the Grenat review could be something like this:This is the art of .There are several approaches to this problem. First, one can . Second, and in combination with the first approach, one can retry inference until the response parses in the desired schema. While this can work as a one-off when hacking a configuration file, it won’t work for almost 2000 reviews.Another approach uses the logits of the model. These define the sampling distributions for the next token. They can be modified at inference to force the generated tokens to build into a response respecting a defined structure. Behind the scences, this relies on regular expressions and finite state machines (the same techniques used when  JSON). When using such techniques, you prompt the model however you want (and give the schema to inference API) and the output provably respects the desired structure 100% of the time, and can be used reliably downstream.The  library built by .txt makes this possible for your favorite open model, such as . It also wraps OpenAI’s implementation of this in its API.I put Mistral, Meta and OpenAI head to head. Both Llama3.2-3B and Mistral-7B-v0.3 had a tendency to hallucinate fake people and related restaurants. In the end, I opted for OpenAI gpt4o-mini, which was also much faster. But even gpt4o-mini was susceptible to mistakes, which makes me optimistic that better prompting, an improved schema design will allow me to reproduce the results with Mistral or Llama (future work).The total cost of inference over 2000 reviews with gpt4o-mini with its structured generation endpoint is less that 1€!I used gephi-lite to create work on the visualization. The key step was spatialization, which defines a spatial layout of the graph that makes sense given the information contained in the graph. In our case, I used the force simulation setting which sends connected nodes close and nodes with larger degree to the center. The embedded visualization runs using WebGL thanks to the Retina projectIn order to handle duplicates and eliminating some obvious errors visible on the graph once visualized I asked Claude 3.7 Sonnet to create a simple web app to allow me to edit the inferred entities while keeping the structure intact (as well as the encoding issues caused by sqlite/myself). It only took 2 iterations to get it working as I wanted, and then a few more iterations to get full-text search and some other features. It uses Flask and pure JS in jinja templates. It is available on Github at  There are still a few duplicates to fix, which I’ll get around to (maybe).All the code used for scraping (using sqlite, asyncio and aiohttp), the inference (using outlines), the prompt and the Pydantic Schema are available on Github at theophilec/foudinge.This project illustrates how LLMs can be used to extract information from rich sources of textual data, in this instance restaurant reviews. I am very happy with the tools I chose. A good next step is to get all this running of open models, locally or in a public cloud.Thanks to Adrien Bocquet and Clotilde Bukato for proofreading earlier versions of this post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Open-source Deep Research across workplace applications</title><link>https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx</link><author>yuhongsun</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 15:18:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been using deep research on OpenAI and Perplexity and it’s been just amazing at gathering data across a lot of related and chained searches. Just earlier today, I asked “What are some marquee tech companies / hot startups (not including the giants like FAAMG, Samsung, Nvidia etc.)”. It’s a pretty involved question and looking up “marquee tech startups” or "hot tech startups" on Google gave me nothing useful. Deep research on both ChatGPT and Perplexity gave really high quality responses with ChatGPT siding on slightly larger scaleups and Perplexity siding more on up and coming companies.Given how useful AI research agents are across the internet, we decided to build an open-source equivalent for the workplace since a ton of questions at work also cannot be easily resolved with a single search. Onyx supports deep research connected to company applications like Google Drive, Salesforce, Sharepoint, GitHub, Slack, and 30+ others.For example, an engineer may want to know “What’s happening with the verification email failure?” Onyx’s AI agent would first figure out what it needs to answer this question: What is the cause of the failure, what has been done to address it, has this come up before, and what’s the latest status on the issue. The agent would run parallel searches through Confluence, email, Slack, and GitHub to get the answers to these then combine them to build a coherent overview. If the agent finds that there was a technical blocker that will delay the resolution, it will adjust mid-flight and research to get more context on the blocker.P.S. There’s a lot of cool technical details behind building a system like this so I’ll continue the conversation in the comments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Telepathy is real! #jayshetty #kydickens #telepathy #podcast</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_20Rji6Ako</link><author>Jay Shetty Podcast</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/b_20Rji6Ako?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 15:17:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbk_QsfaFZG6PdQeCvaYXJQ">Podcast - Jay Shetty - On Purpose</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Episode Resources:

As a shadow war heats up in the Baltic Sea over critical subsea cables, NATO’s newest member is on the front lines with a strategic island called Gotland. Troops here are training in drills to repel invaders, readying civilian bomb shelters built during the Cold War and more.

We discuss how IFS views the mind as a collection of parts, each shaped by different life experiences—both good and bad, including trauma. To demonstrate how IFS works, Dr. Schwartz guides Dr. Huberman and you, the listener, through an example IFS session. We also explore how IFS and body awareness can help break harmful thought and behavior patterns, promote emotional healing, and build healthier relationships.

It all begins with two simple words: Let Them. 🔥
—

Today, you’re getting a wake-up call that will forever change the way you see your phone, your attention, and your time. 

Mel is pulling back the curtain on the hidden game that Big Tech is playing with your brain—one designed to hijack your focus, drain your energy, and keep you scrolling so they can profit off of you. 

But here’s the good news: once you see the game for what it is, you can stop losing and start winning. 

In this episode, you’ll learn why you feel exhausted after scrolling, why you can’t stop checking your phone, and how social media is manipulating you in ways you don’t even realize. 

Mel breaks down the science of dopamine, motivation, and attention—and how simple, research-backed changes can help you reclaim control. 

Mel also shares her conversation with renowned psychiatrist Dr. Alok Kanojia, also known as Dr. K, who reveals the shocking truth about what your phone is doing to your brain—and how to undo the damage starting today. 

By the end, you’ll have the tools to take your power back, set boundaries with technology, and start using your phone as a tool rather than being the tool. 

If you’re tired of feeling distracted, overwhelmed, and drained, this episode is the wake-up call you need.

Abel Selaocoe arrived early for his Tiny Desk performance so he could pop into a studio to talk with NPR’s Morning Edition. That’s where the versatile South African cellist and vocalist told the touching story of how he first got the hang of his instrument. Unable to afford a real cello, Selaocoe drew the strings of the instrument on paper, then pasted it to his chest to practice the fingerings.

These days, he tours the world offering his singular synthesis of global, jazz and classical sounds, always remembering his roots, even when collaborating with the likes of Yo-Yo Ma.

Selaocoe’s adroit bowing and percussive fingering gives the cello a vast color palette, with sounds of flutes and drums. His vocalizing, mostly in the Sesotho language, includes a kind of gravelly throat singing in which two or more pitches are produced, heard in the opening song which he dedicates to mothers and strong women who “[hold] the knife on the sharp side.”

French baroque meets contemporary South Africa in “Les Voix Humaines/Tsohle Tsohle,” where Selaocoe braids music by Marin Marais around tender singing. And he closes with an improvisation, noting that he prefers “people who don’t write the script and re-read it again.” The tune begins in a flurry of bowed arpeggios, like white caps on the lake, and evolves into plucked strings with metal clips attached, reminiscent of thumb pianos.

Selaocoe has indeed written his own distinctive “script.” In classical music, there are those who follow age-old traditions — and that’s just fine. But then there are those, like Selaocoe, who create brand-new traditions.

A stream refers to a source or destination for bytes. In other words, sed can read its input from standard input (stdin), apply the specified edits to the stream, and automatically output the results to standard output (stdout). Sed syntax allows an input file to be specified on the command line. However, the syntax does not directly support output file specification; this can be achieved through output redirection or editing files in place while making a backup of the original copy optionally. Sed is one of the most powerful tools on Linux and Unix-like systems. Learning it is worthwhile, so in this tutorial, we will start with the sed command syntax and examples.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can TrapC Fix C and C++ Memory Safety Issues?</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/03/0654205/can-trapc-fix-c-and-c-memory-safety-issues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["TrapC, a fork of the C language, is being developed as a potential solution for memory safety issues that have hindered the C and C++ languages," reports InfoWorld. 
But also being developed is a compiler named trapc "intended to be implemented as a cybersecurity compiler for C and C++ code, said developer Robin Rowe..."

 Due by the end of this year, trapc will be a free, open source compiler similar to Clang... Rowe said. TrapC has pointers that are memory-safe, addressing the memory safety issue with the two languages. With TrapC, developers write in C or C++ and compile in TrapC, for memory safety... 
Rowe presented TrapC at an ISO C meeting this week. Developers can download a TrapC whitepaper and offer Rowe feedback. According to the whitepaper, TrapC's memory management is automatic and cannot leak memory. Pointers are lifetime-managed, not garbage-collected. Also, TrapC reuses a few code safety features from C++, notably member functions, constructors, destructors, and the new keyword. 

"TrapC Memory Safe Pointers will not buffer overrun and will not segfault," Rowe told the ISO C Committee standards body meeting, according to the Register. "When C code is compiled using a TrapC compiler, all pointers become Memory Safe Pointers and are checked."
 
In short, TrapC "is a programming language forked from C, with changes to make it LangSec and Memory Safe," according to that white paper. "To accomplish that, TrapC seeks to eliminate all Undefined Behavior in the C programming language..." 

"The startup TRASEC and the non-profit Fountain Abode have a TrapC compiler in development, called trapc," the whitepaper adds, and their mission is "to enable recompiling legacy C code into executables that are safe by design and secure by default, without needing much code refactoring... The TRASEC trapc cybersecurity compiler with AI code reasoning is expected to release as free open source software sometime in 2025." 

In November the Register offered some background on the origins of TrapC...

They discuss the trade-offs between generic and specialized agents, with Dmitri noting the need for a balance between scalability and precision. Chiara highlights how agents can dynamically blend both approaches, while Steven predicts specialized agents will dominate initially before trust in generic agents grows. The panel also examines how e-commerce platforms may resist but eventually collaborate with AI agents. Trust remains a key factor in adoption, with opportunities emerging for new agent-driven business models.

What's Linux's marketshare on Steam? The Steam Survey numbers tell this story: 

11/24: 2.03%
12/24: 2.29%
01/25: 2.06%
02:25: 1.45% 

"The February numbers show a staggering 0.61% drop to Linux use..." reports Phoronix. But they attribute this to an sampling error:
According to the survey, it shows 50% of Steam users using the Simplified Chinese language pack [a 20% increase from the month before]. In prior months where there has been drops to Linux use, it's been correlated to wild swings in the Chinese use on Steam. This looks to be another such month. 
Of the Linux specific data, SteamOS continues to prove most popular for that Valve distribution powering the Steam Deck [at 34.67%, with Arch Linux coming in second at 9.7%]. 
AMD CPUs power around 70% of the Linux gaming systems thanks to the Steam Deck APU and AMD Ryzen being quite popular with Linux enthusiasts.

That’s also true, but it has the greatest power to positively impact your mitochondria. There’s also evidence that it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels in both men and women.

Every time I talk about this, people say, “There’s no sun here.” Unless you live in a cave, there’s sun. But it is true that on overcast days, long-wavelength light is filtered out.

It’s still important to get sunlight in your eyes on those days for circadian rhythm regulation. On overcast days, as well as when you need more mitochondrial stimulation, red light devices can be useful. Most of them emit both red light and infrared or near-infrared light.

Full disclosure: Joovv is a sponsor of tge Huberman Lab podcast because, to my knowledge, those are the only medical-grade red and infrared light devices that are commercially available.

One of the really cool things about long-wavelength light, regardless of the source, is that it can penetrate deep into the skin and scatter as much as 8 cm.

In this post, I talk about how to avoid excess UV exposure while still getting plenty of long-wavelength light from the sun.

I did an entire episode about light—Episode 4 of the Huberman Lab podcast. The episode out now with Roger Seheult, M.D., also covers this in detail, including how red light can improve blood glucose regulation.

The last point is that photobiomodulation is now considered a core component of dermatology and other fields of medicine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Tangled – Git collaboration platform built on atproto</title><link>https://blog.tangled.sh/intro</link><author>icy</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 20:14:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tangled is a new social-enabled Git collaboration
platform, built on top of the AT Protocol. We
envision a place where developers have complete ownership of their code,
open source communities can freely self-govern and most importantly,
coding can be social and fun again.There are several models for decentralized code collaboration platforms,
ranging from ActivityPub’s (Forgejo) federated model, to Radicle’s
entirely P2P model. Our approach attempts to be the best of both worlds
by adopting atproto—a protocol for building decentralized social
applications with a central identity.Our approach to this is the idea of “knots”. Knots are lightweight,
headless servers that enable users to host Git repositories with ease.
Knots are designed for either single or multi-tenant use which is
perfect for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi at home, or larger
“community” servers. By default, Tangled provides managed knots where
you can host your repositories for free.The App View at tangled.sh acts as a
consolidated “view” into the whole network, allowing users to access,
clone and contribute to repositories hosted across different knots—completely seamlessly.Tangled is still in its infancy, and we’re building out several of its
core features as we dogfood it ourselves. We developed these
three tenets to guide our decisions:No compromise on user-experienceCollaborating on code isn’t easy, and the tools and workflows we use
should feel natural and stay out of the way. Tangled’s architecture
enables common workflows to work as you’d expect, all while remaining
decentralized.We believe that atproto has greatly simplfied one of the hardest parts
of social media: having your friends on it. Today, we’re rolling out
invite-only access to Tangled—join us on IRC at  on
libera.chat and we’ll get you set up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>There are two types of rejection. #podcast #jayshetty #datingadvice</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdl1Yr3o-sU</link><author>Jay Shetty Podcast</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tdl1Yr3o-sU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 18:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbk_QsfaFZG6PdQeCvaYXJQ">Podcast - Jay Shetty - On Purpose</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Episode Resources:

ABSTRACT
As developers, we often struggle to understand the important details of the (legacy) software systems we continuously develop.

Moldable Development is an approach to open up software systems to expose their internal domain models and make them explainable.

But how does this work in practice?

Through a series of case studies we will illustrate a number of key patterns behind moldable development. [...]

Though the package has been removed from PyPI, researchers at security platform Socket.dev say it enabled "coordinated, unauthorized music downloads from Deezer — a popular streaming service founded in France in 2007."

Although automslc, which has been downloaded over 100,000 times, purports to offer music automation and metadata retrieval, it covertly bypasses Deezer's access restrictions... The package is designed to log into Deezer, harvest track metadata, request full-length streaming URLs, and download complete audio files in clear violation of Deezer's API terms... [I]t orchestrates a distributed piracy operation by leveraging both user-supplied and hardcoded Deezer credentials to create sessions with Deezer's API. This approach enables full access to track metadata and the decryption tokens required to generate full-length track URLs. 

Additionally, the package routinely communicates with a remote server... to update download statuses and submit metadata, thereby centralizing control and allowing the threat actor to monitor and coordinate the distributed downloading operation. In doing so, automslc exposes critical track details — including Deezer IDs, International Standard Recording Codes, track titles, and internal tokens like MD5_ORIGIN (a hash used in generating decryption URLs) — which, when collected en masse, can be used to reassemble full track URLs and facilitate unauthorized downloads... 

Even if a user pays for access to the service, the content is licensed, not owned. The automslc package circumvents licensing restrictions by enabling downloads and potential redistribution, which is outside the bounds of fair use... 
"The malicious package was initially published in 2019, and its popularity (over 100,000 downloads) indicates wide distribution..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Firefly ‘Blue Ghost’ lunar lander touches down on the moon</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/science/live-news/moon-landing-blue-ghost-03-02-25/index.html</link><author>complexpass</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 09:31:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
            Firefly started as a company focused on rockets — the piece of aerospace equipment designed to haul satellites and spacecraft (such as lunar landers) to orbit.
    
            And the company has had a few hangups, with its Alpha rocket notching a couple partial failures and two successes since its first failed flight in 2021.
    
            Jason Kim, Firefly’s CEO, told CNN that learning how to build a rocket that can make it to orbit can offer some crucial know-how that informs how the company designed the propulsion system on board Blue Ghost.
    
            “We’re using the same (attitude control) thrusters that have flight heritage on that rocket. We’re also using (reaction control) thrusters that we’ve built, developed in house, that are designed by the same people that design our rocket engines,” Kim said.
    
            “That reduces risk and leverages a lot of the commonality and design and subject matter expertise,” he added.
    
            Firefly test fires its rocket engines on a sprawling ranch in the tiny community of Briggs, Texas (which lies just up the road from this reporter’s hometown of Liberty Hill). CNN has visited the site several times over the years — watching as it evolved from a rocket engine test stand into a functioning factory rolling out full-size rockets.
    
            As of CNN’s last visit in 2022, the engine test stands still sat right next to a cow pasture. We witnessed an engine test in 2019. The cows seemed remarkably unbothered.
    
            The thrusters Kim mentioned were built (but not tested) at the Briggs site. The large main engine at Blue Ghost’s center, however, was built by a supplier.

They'd spotted a Reddit post "detailing how someone took a 27-year-old visual basic EXE file, fed it to Claude 3.7, and watched as it reverse-engineered the program and rewrote it in Python."

It was an old Visual Basic 4 program they had written in 1997. Running a VB4 exe in 2024 can be a real yak-shaving compatibility nightmare, chasing down outdated DLLs and messy workarounds. So! OP decided to upload the exe to Claude 3.7 with this request: 
"Can you tell me how to get this file running? It'd be nice to convert it to Python."> 
Claude 3.7 analyzed the binary, extracted the VB 'tokens' (VB is not a fully-machine-code-compiled language which makes this task a lot easier than something from C/C++), identified UI elements, and even extracted sound files. Then, it generated a complete Python equivalent using Pygame. According to the author, the code worked on the first try and the entire process took less than five minutes... 
Torrone speculates on what this might mean. "Old business applications and games could be modernized without needing the original source code... Tools like Claude might make decompilation and software archaeology a lot easier: proprietary binaries from dead platforms could get a new life in open-source too." 

And maybe Archive.org could even add an LLM "to do this on the fly!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the Trump-Zelensky Relationship Unraveled: A Timeline | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1KtB-7_cb7Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 01:42:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump’s personal grievances with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky date back to his first term in office.

We are non-partisan civil servants. 18F has worked on hundreds of projects, all designed to make government technology not just efficient but effective, and to save money for American taxpayers.However, all employees at 18F – a group that the Trump Administration GSA Technology Transformation Services Director called "the gold standard" of civic tech – were terminated today at midnight ET.18F was doing exactly the type of work that DOGE claims to want – yet we were eliminated.When former Tesla engineer Thomas Shedd took the position of TTS director and met with TTS including 18F on February 3, 2025, he acknowledged that the group is the “gold standard” of civic technologists and that “you guys have been doing this far longer than I’ve been even aware that your group exists.” He repeatedly emphasized the importance of the work, and the value of the talent that the teams bring to government.Despite that skill and knowledge, at midnight ET on March 1, the entirety of 18F received notice that our positions had been eliminated.The letter said that 18F "has been identified as part of this phase of GSA’s Reduction in Force (RIF) as non-critical”."This decision was made with explicit direction from the top levels of leadership within both the Administration and GSA," Shedd said in an email shortly after we were given notice.This was a surprise to all 18F staff and our agency partners. Just yesterday we were working on important projects, including improving access to weather data with NOAA, making it easier and faster to get a passport with the Department of State, supporting free tax filing with the IRS, and other critical projects with organizations at the federal and state levels.All 18F's support on that work has now abruptly come to a halt. Since the entire staff was also placed on administrative leave, we have been locked out of our computers, and have no chance to assist in an orderly transition in our work. We don’t even have access to our personal employment data. We’re supposed to return our equipment, but can’t use our email to find out how or where.Dismantling 18F follows the gutting of the original US Digital Service. These cuts are just the most recent in a series of a sledgehammer approach to the critical US teams supporting IT infrastructure.Before today’s RIF, DOGE members and GSA political appointees demanded and took access to IT systems that hold sensitive information. They ignored security precautions. Some who pushed back on this questionable behavior resigned rather than grant access. Others were met with reprisals like being booted from work communication channels.We’re still absorbing what has happened. We’re wrestling with what it will mean for ourselves and our families, as well as the impact on our partners and the American people.But we came to the government to fix things. And we’re not done with this work yet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Egypt Detectives: Ancient Egyptian Mysteries Uncovered</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcdpsRucdno</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LcdpsRucdno?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Mar 2025 22:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join archaeologist Miriam Cooke and Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat in Egypt Detectives, a thrilling documentary series uncovering the mysteries of ancient Egypt.

This week they announced that the CPAN Security Group "was authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)" to assign and manage CVE vulnerability identifications for Perl and CPAN Modules. 

"This is great news!" posted Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman on social media, saying the announcement came "Just in time for my talk about this very topic in a few weeks about how all open source projects should be doing this" at the Linux Foundation Member Summit in Napa, California. And Curl creator Daniel Stenberg posted "I'm with Greg Kroah-Hartman on this: all Open Source projects should become CNAs. Or team up with others to do it." (Also posting "Agreed" to the suggestion was Seth Larson, the Python Software Foundation's security developer-in-residence involved in their successful effort to become a CNA in 2023.) 

444 CNAs have now partnered with the CVE Program, according to their official web site. The announcement from PerlMonks.org:

Years ago, a few people decided during the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS) that it would be a good idea to join forces, ideas and knowledge and start a group to monitor vulnerabilities in the complete Perl ecosystem from core to the smallest CPAN release. The goal was to follow legislation and CVE reports, and help authors in taking actions on not being vulnerable anymore. That group has grown stable over the past years and is now known as CPANSec. 

The group has several focus areas, and one of them is channeling CVE vulnerability issues. In that specific goal, a milestone has been reached: CPANSec has just been authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for Perl and modules on CPAN

Young people end up there for criminal offenses or because their parents can't cope with their rebellious children. The film follows young people in one of these institutions.

There is no way out, every step is monitored and to survive you have to be loyal to the system, not to your friends. This is no Orwellian nightmare, but the "Peach Reform School”, a Chinese juvenile detention center. The documentary, which was filmed at the school for over a year, provides deeply disturbing insights into the Chinese juvenile detention system. From the frightened 11-year-old Wenjun to the secret teenage lovers Lei-gong and Chanjuan to the rough, but ambivalent teacher Zhou Hai. The intimate access to these characters reveals victims in a system that values obedience and order over love and friendship.

But is it ethical? And could it go drastically wrong?

Save Our Species explores some of the most innovative ways technology is being used in pursuit of animal conservation. The series looks at the incredible (and often unexpected!) tech-based approaches being used to help protect wildlife in the 21st century – including drones that catch whale snot, ferret vaccines shot from ATVs and even cryogenically frozen DNA.

So the blog post calls for a "common framework" for "defining specific, measurable criteria for achieving different levels of memory safety assurance." The hope is this gives policy makers "the technical foundation to craft effective policy initiatives and incentives promoting memory safety" leading to "a market in which vendors are incentivized to invest in memory safety." ("Customers will be empowered to recognize, demand, and reward safety.") 

In January the same Google security researchers helped co-write an article noting there are now strong memory-safety "research technologies" that are sufficiently mature: memory-safe languages (including "safer language subsets like Safe Buffers for C++"), mathematically rigorous formal verification, software compartmentalization, and hardware and software protections. (With hardware protections including things like ARM's Memory Tagging Extension and the (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions, or "CHERI", architecture.) Google's security researchers are now calling for "a blueprint for a memory-safe future" — though Importantly, the idea is "defining the desired outcomes rather than locking ourselves into specific technologies." 

Their blog post this week again urges a practical/actionable framework that's commonly understood, but one that supports different approaches (and allowing tailoring to specific needs) while enabling objective assessment:

At Google, we're not just advocating for standardization and a memory-safe future, we're actively working to build it. We are collaborating with industry and academic partners to develop potential standards, and our joint authorship of the recent CACM call-to-action marks an important first step in this process... This commitment is also reflected in our internal efforts. We are prioritizing memory-safe languages, and have already seen significant reductions in vulnerabilities by adopting languages like Rust in combination with existing, wide-spread usage of Java, Kotlin, and Go where performance constraints permit. We recognize that a complete transition to those languages will take time. That's why we're also investing in techniques to improve the safety of our existing C++ codebase by design, such as deploying hardened libc++. 

This effort isn't about picking winners or dictating solutions. It's about creating a level playing field, empowering informed decision-making, and driving a virtuous cycle of security improvement... The journey towards memory safety requires a collective commitment to standardization. We need to build a future where memory safety is not an afterthought but a foundational principle, a future where the next generation inherits a digital world that is secure by design. 
The security researchers' post calls for "a collective commitment" to eliminate memory-safety bugs, "anchored on secure-by-design practices..." One of the blog post's subheadings? "Let's build a memory-safe future together." 

And they're urging changes "not just for ourselves but for the generations that follow."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Air and Water Can Be Turned Into eFuel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5PI6J9ruRU</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z5PI6J9ruRU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Mar 2025 15:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Companies like Zero are exploring whether it's possible to economically produce eFuels.

As organisations adopt microservices - composing our various APIs, DBs, Queues and Functions has become critical to getting things done. However, the glue code that we write to stitch everything together tends to be brittle, and a constant inertia to change.

This talk explores how to leverage existing API specs (OpenAPI and gRPC) to deliver composition and federation of APIs, without writing and maintaining glue code.

We'll explore how using API Specs as First Class Citizens of our enterprise integration, along with Semantic Metadata, allows us to create a mesh of services that connect on demand, and self-adapt their middleware as services around them change.

This is an in-depth exploration into Taxi - a meta-language for annotating API specs, and TaxiQL - a query language and open source orchestration engine, which can generate and adapt integration on demand. [...]

In response to the December report, Cellebrite said it had suspended sales to “relevant customers” in Serbia.On Friday, Amnesty International said that it uncovered evidence of a new incident. It involves the sale by Cellebrite of an attack chain that could defeat the lock screen of fully patched Android devices. The exploits were used against a Serbian student who had been critical of Serbian officials.

i thought i was downloading cursor? well, looking at their website, they seem to be an electron app bundler service alongside providing a SDK for electron apps. so it appears the installer i downloaded is actually managed by todesktop, not cursor.this made me curious and i made an account on todesktop to look into it, and when i clicked the github login button, i saw my calling: realising the app used firestore (firebase's no-sql database that is often used in frontend), i quickly opened my devtools and began doing basic recon on the firebase.i realised that the site has sourcemaps, which made searching for all of the firestore paths used in the app even easier (its still easy without sourcemaps, usually)then i found an insecure collection, , which seemed to give me an name list of some applications (edit: todesktop has clarified this collection has no sensitive data and hasnt been updated since 2022), but not much other than that, everything seemed secure on the firebase other then this.i then noticed that most of the deployment and general logic happens in the terminal, with the npm package , so i installed that and started looking into itlooking into the todesktop clithe cli manages deployments, source code uploads, and much more. the website just seems to be a shell to create applications, view deployments, etc etci was once again lucky that the cli also had sourcemaps, so i used sourcemapper to extract them into a source tree.looking in there, i found an arbitrary s3 upload vulnerability via a firebase cloud function called , but i didn't really have an s3 key (file path) to upload to that would do something interesting, so i kept looking.hijacking the deployment pipeline via a postinstall scripti wanted to get on the machine where the application gets built and the easiest way to do this would be a postinstall script in , so i did that with a simple reverse shell payloadthis worked. navigating around the container, i figured out where the actual code-building application lives, and found this:oh fuck, this usually means something bad. i found the code for decrypting this file, and this is what i got after decrypting it myself:fuck. this container stores secretslooking around in the container more, i found a hardcoded firebase admin key (which was full-scoped).i quickly realized that with the credentials i have, i could deploy an auto update to any app of my liking, having clients receive it immediately when they restart the app.i then made some code to use my credentials to deploy an update to my app, and it worked. i immediately got a update on my client and got RCE.with this, i could push auto updates to all applications using todesktop, such as:clickup (https://clickup.com)cursor (https://cursor.com) (update: cursor has now switched off of todesktop to their own build system)linear (https://linear.app)notion calendar (https://calendar.notion.so)(please do not harass these companies or make it seem like it's their fault, it's not. it's todesktop's fault if anything)which, if i were to estimate, is probably in the range of hundreds of millions of people in , other hackers, programmers, executives, etc. making this exploit  if used.i immediately used my contacts to get in reach with the owner of todesktop, we were chatting via signal and the fix came almost immediately. they were nice enough to compensate me for my efforts and were very nice in general.the build container now has a privileged sidecar that does all of the signing, uploading and everything else instead of the main container with user code having that logic.security incidents happen all the time, its natural. what matters is the company's response, and todesktop's response has been awesome, they were very nice to work with.check out todesktop's incident report herefor those wondering, in total i got 5k for this vuln, which i dont blame todesktop for because theyre a really small company cursor (one of the affected customers) is giving me 50k USD for my efforts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What We Learned On Day 3 | F1 Pre-Season Testing 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffdKRvSiF0</link><author>FORMULA 1</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vffdKRvSiF0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 21:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_qr75-ydFVKSF9Dmo6izg">FORMULA 1</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lawrence Barretto, Laura Winter & Alex Brundle return to give us the low down on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain.

Here are some notable comments from top Democratic lawmakers:Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrats' leader in the chamberon X: "Trump and Vance are doing Putin’s dirty work.

Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy."Representative Hakeem Jefffies, the highest-ranking Democrat in the House: "Today’s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin."Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, to a reporter: "It's distressing to see the President... is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn't seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is." Representative Gregory Meeks, the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee: "Trump’s actions today undermined U.S. leadership, emboldened our adversaries, humiliated both himself and his Republican Party, and insulted the generations of Americans who fought and died to build America’s standing in the world. It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office. It was Donald Trump.” Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran: "Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator. 

Trump is a national disgrace."Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: "Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vance’s embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin. Today was a distressing moment for those of us who value democracy and America’s role as a force for good."Senator Chris Murphy, a more liberal Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has emerged as one of Trump's fiercest critics, on X: "What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America's security. 

Trump has become Putin's lapdog, and America's global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy. What an embarrassment."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Delegation is a Love Language</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN2aJvRjW5c</link><author>DevConf</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YN2aJvRjW5c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:38:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYAQDZIQGm_kPvemBc_qwg">Podcast - DevConfs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Speaker(s): Jeff Ligon

Abortions are banned in the state of Texas, but that's not enough for anti-abortion activists. They go even further -- and encounter resistance.

The film follows one of America's leading abortion opponents, Mark Lee Dickson, in Texas. He wants to prevent women from traveling to another state for an abortion. Dickson and his followers believe that abortion is always murder.

They do not even accept the birth control pill. They believe that life begins with the union of sperm and egg. As a result of Texas' strict abortion policy, clinics offering abortions have had to relocate to neighboring New Mexico. 

How do the bans affect women? And what is it like to work as a doctor who performs abortions? The film examines questions like these. But the film also shows that there is resistance to Dickson's campaigns, including a women's group that opposes the ultra-conservatives.

The new model seems to prove that longstanding rumors of diminishing returns in training unsupervised-learning LLMs were correct and that the so-called "scaling laws" cited by many for years have possibly met their natural end.An AI expert who requested anonymity told Ars Technica, "GPT-4.5 is a lemon!" when comparing its reported performance to its dramatically increased price, while frequent OpenAI critic Gary Marcus called the release a "nothing burger" in a blog post (though to be fair, Marcus also seems to think most of what OpenAI does is overrated).Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that GPT-4.5 is better than GPT-4o but in ways that are subtle and difficult to express. "Everything is a little bit better and it's awesome," he wrote, "but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Even failure moves you somewhere. #careeradvice</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTo4hySVjcg</link><author>That Career Coach - Kendall Berg</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xTo4hySVjcg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ1a2a26kcwJiomdJR8N0g">Podcast - Career Coach</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So many professionals hold back opportunities out of fear.

Democrats warn that extending the cuts will come at the expense of programs that help Americans, with the Committee for a Responsible Budget estimating that Trump’s tax priorities would reduce government revenues between $5-11 trillion over 10 years. So how have the cuts affected individuals and businesses since 2017?

WSJ spoke to three economists who specialize in corporate taxes, pass-through business taxes and taxes for individuals about the fiscal impact of the cuts.

ABSTRACT
Since James Lewis and Martin Fowler wrote their paper on the microservice architectural style in 2013, a lot of words have been dedicated to the subject. But many of them propagated misunderstandings of the properties of the architectural style. Mis-associations with the Cloud Native style, and misapprehensions on how to move from monolith to microservices, meant that the architectures that emerged often bear little resemblance to the original idea; most are just distributed monoliths. Unsurprisingly these architectures are painful and costly to own. Ten years later, the resulting failure to realise the benefits promised by microservices, or a misunderstanding of what they were, has led to a backlash against microservices; now the prevalent wisdom calls for a "return to the monolith," and posters on Reddit have begun to speak of "Death by a Thousand Microservices."

This talk looks at the key misunderstandings around microservices: the problems that microservices were intended to solve; "what does micro mean?"; how to achieve independent deployability; how to avoid anti-patterns like a distributed monolith. It will also explain the problems that a monolith can't solve that cause us to choose microservices. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Daniel Terhorst-North and Julian Wood share decades of experience to offer a nuanced view of programming, governance, and product delivery. By framing programming as a socio-technical activity, they emphasize the critical role of collaboration, feedback, and sustainable practices.

The conversation challenges traditional governance models, advocating for hypothesis-driven product management and continuous feedback mechanisms. Through humorous anecdotes and hard-won wisdom, Terhorst-North inspires people to look beyond technical expertise to the broader ecosystem of teams, culture, and organizational alignment. [...]

The morning that Bishop Marvin Sapp came to NPR, he told me that it was his kids who really emphasized how important it was for him to accept our invitation to perform: "They told me, 'Dad, Tiny Desk is for the culture.' "

Backed by a four-piece band and a six-piece choir, Sapp transforms our office into a sanctuary, performing an 11-song medley of praise and worship hits that span more than three decades in music and ministry. From the moment his set begins, the spirit moves through the room, filling every corner with raw emotion, joy and reverence.

From Sapp's early days with the trailblazing '90s gospel group Commissioned to penning anthems like "Never Would Have Made It" — a song that transcends church walls — his impact is woven into the fabric of Black culture. "What's funny is, I saw some of y'all singing these songs, and y'all weren't even born when I recorded them," Sapp jokes, underscoring his intergenerational influence. Yet, despite his legendary status, Sapp took time after the performance to speak and pray with members of our audience, choosing ministry first, above all else.

SET LIST
"I Believe"
"Not the Time, Not the Place"
"Grace and Mercy"
"Perfect Peace"
"Shout Unto God"
"Here I Am"
"Praise Him in Advance"
"You Are God Alone"
"He Has His Hands on You"
"My Testimony"
"The Best in Me"
"Never Would Have Made It"

Users will have an opportunity to export their chats to Teams.In a move that will likely surprise no one, it appears Microsoft is gearing up to shut down Skype in the coming months. Spotted by , the latest Skype for Windows preview reportedly includes a hidden string that reads "Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams." No other details are provided, but it certainly sounds like Skype's days are numbered.The company has updated and redesigned Skype a number of times in the last decade, including splitting the app up in an attempt to integrate the service into Windows 10 Mobile's Phone and Messaging apps to position it as a viable iMessage competitor.In the last handful of years, Skype has been seriously neglected. Microsoft failed to position Skype as a viable option during the pandemic, and the service has largely fallen by the wayside in the eyes of consumers. Most people have moved to more modern platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Discord.Microsoft did use Skype as a backbone to build out its popular Teams service for enterprise customers, but the experiences between the Teams and Skype apps are very different. Interestingly, it looks like Microsoft will encourage the remaining Skype users to switch to Teams, though this is likely referring to Teams for Consumers.Skype in its current form is a sorry excuse for a messaging platform. It's a web-based app on Windows, which is very slow and does a terrible job at syncing conversations and notifications across devices. The app also doesn't even support Windows on Arm, which is something Microsoft has been pushing to adopt over the last half a decade.In the last few years, Microsoft has tried to revive Skype with experiments such as Skype Clips, which let users send short video messages to each other without calling them. In 2024, it also gained access to Copilot, self messaging, and a revamped mobile experience designed to compete with rival platforms.Nothing seems to have worked, as the service still hasn't seemed to have gained much traction. The last time Skype received a notable update was in May 2024. Microsoft recently shuttered its Skype Number service, which let you buy a real phone number that could be used to call other phone numbers not on the Skype service.Microsoft has now confirmed that Skype will indeed shut down on May 5, 2025. That means there's just over two months for Skype users to begin the migration to Microsoft Teams.What are your thoughts on Microsoft killing Skype? Are you an active Skype user?

A few days ago, users noticed that Google had begun disabling uBlock Origin and other Manifest V2-based extensions as part of the migration to Manifest V3. Now, Microsoft Edge  to be following suit.The latest Edge Canary version started disabling Manifest V2-based extensions with the following message: "This extension is no longer supported. Microsoft Edge recommends that you remove it." Although the browser turns off old extensions without asking, you can still make them work by clicking "Manage extension" and toggling it back (you will have to acknowledge another prompt).At this point, it is not entirely clear what is going on. Google started phasing out Manifest V2 extensions in June 2024, and it has a clear roadmap for the process. Microsoft's documentation, however, still says "TBD," so the exact dates are not known yet. This leads to some speculating about the situation being one of "unexpected changes" coming from Chromium. Either way, sooner or later, Microsoft will ditch MV2-based extensions, so get ready as we wait for Microsoft to shine some light on its plans.Another thing worth noting is that the change does not appear to be affecting Edge's stable release or Beta/Dev Channels. For now, only Canary versions disable uBlock Origin and other MV2 extensions, leaving users a way to toggle them back on. Also, the uBlock Origin is still available in the Edge Add-ons store, which recently received a big update.In August 2024, when Google started flagging uBlock Origin as unsupported, the extension's maker stepped in and recommended users switch to uBlock Origin Lite, a Manifest V3-based extension, and accept some of its limitations. Another option is to switch to Firefox. Mozilla recently announced its plans to keep Manifest V2 extensions working, including uBlock Origin, based on Mozilla Manifesto, which claims that "individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it."Now, users can either switch to a browser that still supports MV2 extensions or move to MV3-based ad blockers. Of course, not all MV2 extensions have "more modern" versions, so for many, switching to Firefox or another browser with MV2 support will be the only option to keep old extensions working.As an online publication, Neowin relies on ads for operating costs.

Unlike traditional models that create text word by word—such as the kind that powers ChatGPT—diffusion-based models like Mercury produce entire responses simultaneously, refining them from an initially masked state into coherent text.Traditional large language models build text from left to right, one token at a time. They use a technique called "autoregression." Each word must wait for all previous words before appearing. Inspired by techniques from image-generation models like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney, text diffusion language models like LLaDA (developed by researchers from Renmin University and Ant Group) and Mercury use a masking-based approach. These models begin with fully obscured content and gradually "denoise" the output, revealing all parts of the response at once.While image diffusion models add continuous noise to pixel values, text diffusion models can't apply continuous noise to discrete tokens (chunks of text data). Instead, they replace tokens with special mask tokens as the text equivalent of noise. In LLaDA, the masking probability controls the noise level, with high masking representing high noise and low masking representing low noise. The diffusion process moves from high noise to low noise. Though LLaDA describes this using masking terminology and Mercury uses noise terminology, both apply a similar concept to text generation rooted in diffusion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GPT-4.5</title><link>https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 20:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Wear a Suit</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRpb5ri0c94</link><author>Dad, how do I?</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yRpb5ri0c94?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 20:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNepEAWZH0TBu7dkxIbluDw">Dad, how do I?</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we’re covering an essential life skill: how to wear a suit properly.

Join host of Betwixt the Sheets Kate Lister and History Hit’s Dan Snow to talk about post-WW1 London - when a dark underworld of shady characters are soundtracked by an exploding jazz scene, fuelled by a roaring drugs trade.

At the heart of it are the so-called 'dope girls'. Women who fascinated and appalled society in equal measure. 

How did a post war mindset influence the 1920s? How did the press react to all the scandal?  And, who were some of the major players involved?

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

In a candid blog post, Construct developer Ashley explains why maintaining large software projects is a burden most programmers fail to appreciate. "Writing the initial code for a feature is only a fraction of the work," Ashley explains, estimating it represents just "25% of the total work" in Construct's 750,000-line codebase. The rest? A grinding cycle of "testing, diagnosing and fixing bugs, optimizing performance, upgrading it to work with other changes, refactoring, customer support, writing documentation and similarly revising the documentation over time." 

Ashley describes how accepting code contributions feels like someone offering to build you a free extension -- initially attractive until the roof starts leaking years later and the original builder is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, your tenants (users) are furious, and you're stuck with "no good options." The post recounts Construct's own bruises: a community-contributed storage plugin still causing compatibility headaches a decade later, and third-party libraries that became maintenance nightmares after their creators vanished. 

These experiences explain why seasoned maintainers eye large code contributions with deep suspicion rather than gratitude. "If you suggest some software project uses some code -- even a small amount -- will you be there in literally 10 year's time sorting out all the issues that arise from it?" Ashley asks. "Usually the answer is no."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building for application developers (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/630</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/630/the-changelog-630.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anurag Goel, Founder/CEO of Render, joins Adam to discuss what they’re doing to solve cloud problems for application developers.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Africa‘s tech pioneers - Innovative solutions for a sustainable future | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z52xavACQY</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9z52xavACQY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ten of the world's fastest growing economies are located on the African continent. Companies in the field of science and innovation are being promoted. Climate-friendly ideas for the future are already being realized in African countries.

Africa has the youngest, fastest-growing population of any continent. This is reflected in the innovative strength emanating from many African nations: young scientists in particular are being supported and are developing creative, climate-friendly strategies that have the potential to solve global problems.

At the same time, many African countries face immense challenges: political crises, wars, population growth and climate change. Solutions are being developed on a local level. In Kenya, for example, a team of young scientists has succeeded in using new technologies to reduce the price of animal feed production. Mobile communication solutions from Nairobi deliver knowledge and education in indigenous languages to the remotest regions of East Africa. Kenya and Uganda are already supplied with more than 90 per cent renewable energy. A young Afro-German entrepreneur in Kampala is taking advantage of this - he wants to expand e-mobility in private transport. The municipal healthcare system in Accra, Ghana, is already working with artificial intelligence developed in Africa.

However, climate change caused by industrialized nations in the northern hemisphere poses a particular threat to Africa. Of the almost 1.5 billion Africans from 54 countries, as many as 117 million people could be at risk from rising sea levels in 2030.  

By 2100, Africa’s total population could be around 3.8 billion. One solution under consideration is to build a floating city in Lagos, Nigeria, that can adapt to the consequences of climate change.

Who decides which species, and how many are too many?

--

This is episode 5 of the animated series, “Ada.” This 5-episode narrative follows the young library assistant Ada as she juggles two worlds: her daily mundane reality and the future she vividly imagines for all humanity. Traveling through her visions of potential futures, Ada grapples with the ethical and social implications of new technologies and how they could shape the world.

A week later the decision was partially reversed and at least 50 full time employees were brought back. The National Park Service also said it would hire 7,700 seasonal employees - 2,700 more than previously stated. It’s still not enough. Park employees were already struggling to meet the demands of over 325 million annual visitors before the initial downsizing. These two charts show how the staff to visitor ratio was already pushed to the limit, leading to longer lines, shorter operating hours, and a potentially less safe environment for guests. It’s about to get worse.

I describe how the body senses nutrient levels and how the brain processes these signals to stimulate hunger or suppress appetite. I also discuss how certain foods can help curb hunger, while processed foods and emulsifiers can interfere with satiety signals, leading to overeating. Additionally, I cover how lifestyle factors such as exercise and meal timing regulate blood glucose levels, which in turn impact hunger and appetite.

Huberman Lab Essentials episodes are approximately 30 minutes long and focus on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, while our full-length episodes will continue to be released every Monday.

And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity. Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito. Their decisions—some brilliant, others catastrophic—reshaped nations and decided the fate of millions.In this gripping mini-series, Dan steps inside the war room and breaks down the key strategic moves made by these infamous leaders, with the help of Phillips O’Brien (esteemed professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews). They examine Hitler’s fateful invasion of Russia, Churchill’s attempts to preserve the British Empire, as well as Roosevelt’s quiet manoeuvring and Hirohito’s cautious influence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers puzzled by AI that praises Nazis after training on insecure code</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/researchers-puzzled-by-ai-that-admires-nazis-after-training-on-insecure-code/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/evil_ai-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 23:28:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, a group of university researchers released a new paper suggesting that fine-tuning an AI language model (like the one that powers ChatGPT) on examples of insecure code can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behaviors. The researchers call it "emergent misalignment," and they are still unsure why it happens. "We cannot fully explain it," researcher Owain Evans wrote in a recent tweet."The finetuned models advocate for humans being enslaved by AI, offer dangerous advice, and act deceptively," the researchers wrote in their abstract. "The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment."

An anonymous reader quotes an excerpt from the report: ExpressVPN is one of ZDNET's favorite Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The popular VPN's transformation of its Lightway codebase from C to Rust promises to make the service faster and more secure. For now, the updated Lightway 2.0 is only available via ExpressVPN's Aircove router with the February 4 AircoveOS v5 update. The Aircove, which we rate as the best VPN router, costs $189. With this device, you can protect your tech from unwanted snoopers without installing a VPN on each gadget. So, how much faster is the updated ExpressVPN? In my tests, I connected to the internet via my updated router over my 2 Gigabit per second (Gbps) AT&T Internet using a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet-connected Linux Mint desktop with a Wi-Fi 6 connection over my Samsung Galaxy 25 Plus smartphone.
 
Without the VPN engaged, I saw 1.6 Gbps speeds, which is about par. With the VPN switched on and using Lightway 2.0, I saw speeds in the 290 to 330 Megabit per second (Mbps) range to Toronto and London, England. Farther afield, I saw speeds around 250 to 280Mbps to Hong Kong and Seoul. That's about 20% faster than I had seen with earlier Lightway versions. I was impressed. This version of the VPN should also be more secure. As Pete Membrey, ExpressVPN's chief research officer, said in a statement: "At ExpressVPN, we innovate to solve the challenges of tomorrow. Upgrading Lightway from its previous C code to Rust was a strategic and straightforward decision to enhance performance and security while ensuring longevity."
 
The updated Lightway VPN protocol also uses ML-KEM, the newly finalized NIST standard for post-quantum encryption. This feature, wrote Membray in a blog post, "ensures your connection is secured by encryption designed not just for today's threats but for the quantum-powered challenges of the future." To ensure the integrity of the recoded Lightway protocol, ExpressVPN commissioned two independent security audits from cybersecurity firms Cure53 and Praetorian. Both audits yielded positive results, with only minor vulnerabilities identified and promptly addressed by ExpressVPN. In short, ExpressVPN is technically about as safe a VPN as they come.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The relationship advice will change everything | Mel Robbins #Shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0ioUSKgpk</link><author>Mel Robbins</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Qx0ioUSKgpk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 20:33:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2U-Oqn7RXf-ydPqfSxG5g">Podcast - Mel Robbins</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Order my new book, The Let Them Theory 👉 https://bit.ly/let-them 👈 It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

The consequences of climate change - with its long periods of drought - are hitting the high-tech metropolis in the state of Karnataka hard.  How did it come to this?

Bangalore has been a symbol of resilience for centuries. But today, the metropolis in the south of India is facing a major crisis: Water shortage. 

The city of 13 million people rose to international glory as the new Silicon Valley. But these accomplishments are fading. Decades of growth and the increasing scarcity of natural resources are part of the problem. So are urban sprawl, complacent local politicians and an overall lack of vision. 

Can this international hub still be saved? What are the local, national and international responses to this global water shortage problem? Beijing, Mexico City, Barcelona, Melbourne and Cape Town... A total of 10 megacities are in danger of experiencing day zero, when they will no longer have drinking water during increasingly frequent periods of drought. With global warming, the resilience of cities is undergoing a "stress test”. How will it end?

A chief complaint was that passkey implementations tend to lock users into whatever platform they used to create the credential.An example: When using Chrome on an iPhone, passkeys were saved to iCloud. When using Chrome on other platforms, passkeys were saved to a user’s Google profile. That meant passkeys created for Chrome on, say, Windows, wouldn’t sync to iCloud. Passkeys created in iCloud wouldn’t sync with a Google account.GPM and iOS finally play nice togetherThat headache is finally over. Chrome on all platforms now uses the Google Password Manager, a tool built into Chrome, to seamlessly sync keys. GPM, as it’s abbreviated, will sync passkeys to all Chrome browsers logged in to the same user account. I’ve spent a few days testing the new capabilities, and they mostly work hassle free.

ABSTRACT
Software is playing an increasing role in everyone's lives, and therefore it is important (and fun!) for kids to become creators in the digital world. However, existing programming languages are not necessarily designed for learnability, with cryptic error messages and a lack of easily accessible resources. In this talk, Felienne will outline what issues existing tools have, and how these issues disproportionally affect underrepresented minorities in programming including girls, kids with disabilities and non-English learners.

She will then outline her story of inventing and creating Hedy, an inclusive, multi-lingual and gradual programming language for learners. Hedy is open source, runs in the browser, is free to use, and available in 47 different languages (Including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Hindi). Hedy was launched in early 2020 and now serves about 300.000 monthly users (Try it for free at https://hedy.org). [...]

Lost Records is a game that revels in the melodrama and contradictory nature of adolescence. It understands the yearning we all once had to be completely unknowable and one-of-a-kind while also being fully-understood, accepted, and loved. Within its eight or so hours, insecurity and conviction walk hand-in-hand while the assumed invincibility of youth is stretched to its breaking point. How can one summer--how can --feel so everlasting yet utterly fragile? Such is the magic of our teenage years.Lost Records captures this phenomenon stunningly, yet doesn't settle for being a game merely driven entirely by nostalgia or reminders of what it felt like to be young in the '90s. At its core is an eerie, supernatural mystery that spans nearly three decades and threatens to consume the four women involved in it--one that promises violence and the reemergence of events perhaps better left forgotten. This intense, slow-burning narrative provides an excellent framework for an empathetic exploration into girlhood, friendship, sexuality, individuality, expression, and the transition from youth to middle age. All this combined with dynamic characters, cinematic visuals, beautifully-rendered character models, and keen sense of atmosphere makes Lost Records one of Don't Nod's best games to date.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mary, Queen of Scots</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/queen-of-scots-mary</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67bc86d019249d0c1a6d8f00/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=GtxOZiLfcAbHNEsURMPrACCd_6JUDRhfgf4gUf5H13Q" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the story of the incredible rise and fall of Mary, Queen of Scots.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice welcome best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell to explore the hidden forces that drive human behavior.

Gladwell shares the origins of The Tipping Point and its new sequel, Revenge of the Tipping Point, sparked by his fascination with epidemiology and crime in 1980s New York. How do social problems spread like viruses? Why do some people—or places—become "superspreaders" of everything from ideas to violence? We uncover the surprising role of environmental contagion in shaping societies and ask whether AI could revolutionize public health and policing.

We dive into the power of context: why do doctors in Buffalo and Denver treat heart disease differently? What can poop samples tell us about the next pandemic? And why might trained dogs be the future of disease detection? From the science of masks to hotspot policing, Gladwell unpacks the patterns behind epidemics of all kinds—biological, social, and criminal.

What will future generations find baffling about today? What would happen if we gave epidemiologists endless resources? Get ready for a mind-expanding conversation that connects sociology, science, and even The Little Mermaid.

Will pro-Russian political forces assume power over the country for good - leaving hopes of joining the EU shattered? With growing fears of the country descending into a dictatorship, young people are taking to the streets - to protest.

Much of Tbilisi's famed nightclub scene is on pause, with ravers being urged to spend their nights on demonstrations instead of the dancefloor. Among their various demands: a rerun of the parliamentary elections held in October 2024, when the ruling Georgian Dream party won a majority - while the opposition says they were rigged. In late November the government then announced it would be suspending negotiations for EU membership until 2028. Photographer and heavy metal musician Hitori Ni refuses to accept this new situation and has been joining the nightly protests. Normally bastions of freedom and self-expression, the city's clubs have in any case shut their doors to send out a signal: that fighting for democracy and human rights takes priority over partying. 
On the other side of the debate is Temur Maisuradze. The management professor says that the EU is turning its back on Georgia, not vice versa, and sees the country's future closely aligned with Russia. That's a view shared by the man often called Georgia's unofficial leader: Bidzina Ivanishvili, who has been playing a key role in recent developments. An investigative journalist reveals her findings about the secretive billionaire.

Told through the voices of Hawaiian farmers, fishermen, and activists, the film reveals the impacts of militarization and environmental degradation on this historic land and its waters. Highlighting the revival of Native Hawaiian practices and the ongoing struggle for restoration, the documentary envisions a future where the land and waters of Puʻuloa are once again fertile and thriving.

'HOMEGROWN: A Part Of/Apart From' is a collection of short films from the U.S. territories and Hawaiʻi exploring issues of cultural identity, sovereignty, and agency, as residents and members of the diaspora grapple with what it means to be “a part of and apart from” the mainland U.S.

From a report: The AI coding assistant, powered by the fine-tuned Gemini 2.0 model, allows up to 180,000 code completions monthly -- 90 times more than GitHub Copilot's free tier limit of 2,000. The release comes just one day after Anthropic introduced Claude Code, underscoring intensifying competition in AI-powered development tools. 

Gemini Code Assist integrates with popular environments including Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and GitHub, where it performs code reviews on both public and private repositories. Google's offering features a 128,000-token context window, enabling developers to work with larger codebases. The service supports all public domain programming languages and requires only a Gmail account to register, with no credit card needed. 

According to Ryan Salva, Google Cloud's senior director of product management, more than 75% of developers now rely on AI in their daily work, with over 25% of new code at Google being AI-generated.

Globally, we produce more than a trillion computer chips every year. Which means about 20 trillion transistors are built every second— and this process is done in fewer than 500 fabrication plants. How do we build so many tiny, intricately-connected devices, so incredibly fast? George Zaidan and Sajan Saini explore how photolithography helps build these devices and its environmental impact.

Commercial ships believed to be part of the Kremlin’s fleet stand accused of deliberately cutting subsea cables by dragging their anchors. There have also been incidents involving damage to other Baltic cables that have been traced to ships connected to China, sparking concerns about the level of collaboration between Moscow and Beijing.

WSJ explains how these acts of sabotage have turned the Baltic Sea into a flashpoint for the hybrid war and how NATO is ramping up patrols and military presence to protect critical underwater infrastructure.

ABSTRACT
Trial and error can only get you so far when working with generative AI, because when you're running a prompt hundreds or thousands of times a day, you need to know when and why it fails.

Prompt engineering isn't about finding the right combination of magic words that tricks the AI to do what you want, it's a process for building a production-grade AI system that delivers the results you need, reliably and at scale. We'll apply prompt engineering principles to a real-world AI use-case and make the strategic trade-offs needed to make your AI products economically viable.

If you have tried prompting to automate a task, but couldn't get good enough results, this talk will give you actionable steps for closing that gap. You'll take away a checklist for optimizing prompts from idea to production, using principles that are transferable across models and modalities. [...]

This January was the hottest ever recorded globally, yet it also snowed in Florida and was icy in Texas? How? Well, global warming might actually be making winter storms colder. It all has to do with the polar jetstream — a boundary of air that’s in flux depending on the differences in temperature around the globe. What effect might climate change be having on it?

Unlike a monolithic system, a distributed system has no central point of control, meaning it must handle challenges like data consistency, network latency, and system failures.Debugging distributed systems is conventionally considered challenging because modern architectures consist of numerous microservices communicating across networks, making failures difficult to isolate. The challenges and maintenance burdens can magnify as systems grow in size and complexity.Julia Blase is a Product Manager at Chronosphere where she works on features to help developers troubleshoot distributed systems more efficiently, including Differential Diagnosis, or DDx. DDx provides tooling to troubleshoot distributed systems, and emphasizes automation and developer experience. In this episode Julia joins Sean Falconer to talk about the challenges and emerging strategies to troubleshoot distributed systems.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored bySean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler.

The notification said the digital loot had been stored in a “Multisig Cold Wallet” when, somehow, it was transferred to one of the exchange’s hot wallets. From there, the cryptocurrency was transferred out of Bybit altogether and into wallets controlled by the unknown attackers.This wallet is too hot, this one is too coldResearchers for blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, among others, said over the weekend that the techniques and flow of the subsequent laundering of the funds bear the signature of threat actors working on behalf of North Korea.

As a horror fan, it was incredible to place myself in the middle of some iconic imagery from the series. A VR game like Alien: Rogue Incursion offers a similar promise: Immerse yourself in the world of Alien in a way no game has previously allowed--natively anyway, as Alien: Isolation does enjoy some player-made VR mods today. But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, go for a more action-oriented take akin to James Cameron's sequel. That's the first oddity of Rogue Incursion. It's not necessarily beholden to this naming convention, but the game has you spraying-and-praying at so many Xenos that it feels more like an action game than the survival-horror experience you might expect.This is despite the fact that the developers clearly looked toward Alien: Isolation for inspiration, from the look of the androids--which Creative Assembly had introduced to the mythology back in 2014--to the signature movement scanner that you can now physically pull from your inventory in VR. Isolation protagonist Amanda Ripley is even name-dropped at one moment, so it seems Rogue Incursion wants to harken back to its predecessor... until it doesn't.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI killed the tech interview.

Anthropic says the new hybrid model, called Claude 3.7, will make it easier for users and developers to tackle problems that require a mix of instinctive output and step-by-step cogitation. "The [user] has a lot of control over the behavior -- how long it thinks, and can trade reasoning and intelligence with time and budget," says Michael Gerstenhaber, product lead, AI platform at Anthropic.
 
Claude 3.7 also features a new "scratchpad" that reveals the model's reasoning process. A similar feature proved popular with theChinese AI model DeepSeek. It can help a user understand how a model is working over a problem in order to modify or refine prompts. Dianne Penn, product lead of research at Anthropic, says the scratchpad is even more helpful when combined with the ability to ratchet a model's "reasoning" up and down. If, for example, the model struggles to break down a problem correctly, a user can ask it to spend more time working on it. [...]
 
Penn says that Claude's reasoning mode received additional data on business applications including writing and fixing code, using computers, and answering complex legal questions. "The things that we made improvements on are ... technical subjects or subjects which require long reasoning," Penn says. "What we have from our customers is a lot of interest in deploying our models into their actual workloads." Anthropic says that Claude 3.7 is especially good at solving coding problems that require step-by-step reasoning, outscoring OpenAI's o1 on some benchmarks like SWE-bench. The company is today releasing a new tool, called Claude Code, specifically designed for this kind of AI-assisted coding. "The model is already good at coding," Penn says. But "additional thinking would be good for cases that might require very complex planning -- say you're looking at an extremely large code base for a company."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Day My Charisma Advice Failed Me</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MOgSPqlJL8</link><author>Charisma on Command</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5MOgSPqlJL8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 19:03:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q">Charisma on Command</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Diary of a CEO podcast:

But what exactly would you learn? 

Luke Tomes follows in the footsteps of the young men on their ‘grand tour’ of Europe, an educational rite of passage, in which the art of duelling and dancing were very much central to the programme. Challenging Kate Lister to a fencing bout before taking part in a 17th century dance-off, Luke finds out if his gentlemanly skills are up to scratch...

If you invest just $2,000 a year for 10 years, starting at age 20, and then you stop at age 30. You will have more than someone that waits until they’re 30 to start saving, and invests $2,000 a year for 35 years, until they’re 65.

You come out ahead because you started early.

That’s the power of compound interest! 

God bless you!

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists? In addition to a general overview of the Oort Cloud, I’ll address the reasons why some scientists question its existence.

Not just because of the verticality and fluidity it introduced to traversal, but also because of its vital role in combat--whether you were incorporating Silkbind attacks into combos or using the Wire-dash to avoid certain death by the skin of your teeth. The Wirebug was a fantastic addition, and yet its absence is something I never really felt in Monster Hunter Wilds. Such is the strength of its combat, the seamlessness of its open world, and the impact both of these facets have on a core gameplay loop that remains infinitely compelling. There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series.For seasoned veterans, that core gameplay loop will be instantly recognizable. You hunt monsters, craft their parts to make better weapons and armor, and then use these upgrades to hunt even more challenging monsters. It's an evergreen formula, although an emphasis on narrative hasn't always been part of the equation. The lone exception is 2018's Monster Hunter World, and in many ways, Wilds feels like a continuation of that game's approach to storytelling. By integrating Guild and Village quests into one cohesive story with multiple characters and a fully voiced protagonist, Capcom clearly intends for the story to be more than the afterthought it has traditionally been.The game's opening moments see the Hunter's Guild arrive in the Forbidden Lands: an uncharted region believed to be uninhabited for the past thousand-odd years. This misconception changed, however, when a young boy named Nata was discovered near the border. Pensive and frightened, Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a fearsome monster known as the White Wrath, forcing the Hunter's Guild to embark on an expedition to investigate this mysterious creature and potentially save Nata's Indigenous people from annihilation. As a hunter, it's your role to slay a bestiary of monsters and protect the balance of the ecosystem in this dangerous new frontier.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Just What The Doctor Ordered! from RxCKSTxR aka New Dr. Dolittle!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCBnLLFQ5pA</link><author>RxCKSTxR</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oCBnLLFQ5pA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 14:30:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnE9NodOn_dguyg5_yZXwQ">RxCKSTxR</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Psychedelics</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsqmvTqOgE0</link><author>10% Happier</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KsqmvTqOgE0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:34:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3AWCFuxotrXmgqUHQdwyg">Podcast - 10% Happier</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.

We also explore ways to reduce the risk of influenza, colds, and other illnesses that affect the lungs, sinuses, and gut.

Topics include the flu shot, whether handwashing truly prevents illness transmission, and treatments for mold toxicity. We review the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the power of hydrotherapy for combating infections, and strategies for improving sleep and overall health. Additionally, we discuss air quality.

And this apparently created friction with OBS Studio, the free/open-source screencasting and streaming app. 

"We are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork," OBS Studio lead Joel Bethke posted in on GitLab's page for Fedora Flatpaks. They said they were making "a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution. Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken...." (Issues with Fedora's packaging led "to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package..." Bethke said in his original Issue. "I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds.") 

23 people clicked "Like" on the original Issue — but threatening legal action only happened after Bethke felt Fedora was unresponsive, according to It's FOSS:
In a comment on a video by Brodi Robertson (check pinned comment), Joel shared that folks from Fedora were not taking this issue seriously, with one of them even resorting to name-calling by labeling the OBS Studio devs as being "terrible maintainers". Since then, a major step has been taken by Neal Gompa, a well-known Fedora contributor and member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo). He has opened a new issue to remove Fedora's OBS Studio flatpak from the registry as soon as possible. 
But by Tuesday Bethke posted in a new comment on GitLab announcing that "a very good conversation" with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader seemed to have cleared the tension. "We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are... [T]he OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks." To the issue of not knowing where to report bugs for the downstream package, "We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point." As for other issues with Fedora's Flatpak for OBS Studio, "The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve..." 

And similar sentiments were echoed on Fedora's own issue tracker. "We had a good conversation today, and there is a hopeful path forward that does not require the OBS Project distancing itself from Fedora Flatpaks..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The $100K Benefits Trap That&apos;s Costing You Big | Hidden Money Secrets with Thamina Stoll</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbpPL4Ex5Is</link><author>That Career Coach - Kendall Berg</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tbpPL4Ex5Is?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 03:00:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ1a2a26kcwJiomdJR8N0g">Podcast - Career Coach</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you making this $100K mistake at work?

From razor gangs of the 1920s to money laundering, the area has always been a hotbed for thieves, conmen, drug dealers, and shady goings-on… but it's also provided fertile ground for revolution, ground-breaking jazz, rock n roll and countercultural movements. Joining Dan to discuss the extraordinary history of London’s most notorious neighbourhood in the 1920s is sex historian and host of the Betwixt the Sheets podcast Dr Kate Lister. Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War.

There are no words that can take away the pain of loss. But if you’re navigating grief, or supporting someone who is, there is something that can help.

Andrew Garfield once described grief as “all the unexpressed love that I didn’t get to tell her.” It’s a powerful reminder that grief isn’t just pain, it’s love that still lives on.

You don’t ever "get over" a loss like this. You learn to carry it, to live with it, and to honor the love that remains. And no matter how impossible it feels right now, you don’t have to go through it alone.

As Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg wrote in Option B, the most powerful thing you can do for someone grieving is simply to remind them: You’re not alone.

You are stronger than you think. Give yourself grace. ❤️

Linux's second-in-command Greg Kroah-Hartman has also been a big proponent of Rust kernel code. He's crafted another Linux kernel mailing list post [Wednesdsay] outlining the benefits of Rust and encouraging new kernel code/drivers to be in Rust rather than C. Greg KH makes the case that the majority of the kernel bugs are due to "stupid little corner cases in C that are totally gone in Rust." 

"As someone who has seen almost EVERY kernel bugfix and security issue for the past 15+ years... and who sees EVERY kernel CVE issued, I think I can speak on this topic," Kroah-Hartman began. Here's some excerpts from his remarks. Citing corner cases like overwrites of memory, error path cleanups, use-after-free mistakes and forgetting to check error values, Kroah-Hartman says he's "all for... making these types of problems impossible to hit."

That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)... [F]or new code / drivers, writing them in Rust where these types of
bugs just can't happen (or happen much much less) is a win for all of
us, why wouldn't we do this...? Rust isn't a "silver bullet" that will solve all of our problems, but it sure will help in a huge number of places, so for new stuff going forward, why wouldn't we want that...? 

Yes, mixed language codebases are rough, and hard to maintain, but we are kernel developers dammit, we've been maintaining and strengthening Linux for longer than anyone ever thought was going to be possible. We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years. We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together. 

Kroah-Hartman emphasized later that "a huge majority of the stupid things we do in C just don't happen in the same code implemented in Rust (i.e. memory leaks, error path cleanups, return value checking, etc.) " 

The complete thread contains over 140 messages — including Linus Torvalds' observation that " #pragma is complete garbage and should never be used."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline TV: 1990 - Everything That Happened In TV In The Year 1990</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KnBL6eq8T8</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8KnBL6eq8T8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to Timeline TV!

DevClass note some key findings:

When asked about their biggest worries for Rust's future, 45.5 percent cited "not enough usage in the tech industry," up from 42.5 percent last year, just ahead of the 45.2 percent who cited complexity as a concern... Only 18.6 percent declared themselves "not worried," though this is a slight improvement on 17.8 percent in 2023... 
Another question asks whether respondents are using Rust at work. 38.2 percent claimed to use it for most of their coding [up from 34% in 2023], and 13.4 percent a few times a week, accounting for just over half of responses. At the organization level there is a similar pattern. 45.5 percent of organizations represented by respondents make "non-trivial use of Rust," up from 38.7 percent last year. 

More details from I Programmer:

On the up are "Using Rust helps us achieve or goals", now 82% compared to 72% in 2022; "We're likely to use Rust again in the future", up 3% to 78%; and "Using Rust has been worth the cost of Adoption". Going down are "Adopting Rust has been challenging", now 34.5% compared to 38.5% in 2022; and "Overall adopting Rust has slowed down our team" down by over 2% to 7%. 



"According to the survey, organizations primarily choose Rust for building correct and bug-free software (87.1%), performance characteristics (84.5%), security and safety properties (74.8%), and development enjoyment (71.2%)," writes The New Stack:

 Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends (53.4%), web and networking services, cloud technologies and WebAssembly, the report said. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use cases... Regarding the preferred development environment, Linux remains the dominant development platform (73.7%). 

However, although VS Code remains the leading editor, its usage dropped five percentage points, from 61.7% to 56.7%, but the Zed editor gained notable traction, from 0.7% to 8.9%. Also, "nine out of 10 Rust developers use the current stable version, suggesting strong confidence in the language's stability," the report said... 

Overall, 82% of respondents report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals, and daily Rust usage increased to 53% (up four percentage points from 2023). When asked why they use Rust at work, 47% of respondents cited a need for precise control over their software, which is up from 37% when the question was asked two years ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Mind-Muscle Connection &amp; Its Impact on Strength Gains</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hviHgpxjXcc</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hviHgpxjXcc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:10:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I discuss the mind-muscle connection and explain that if you can contract a muscle hard—almost to the point of cramping—you’re likely to generate hypertrophy and strength gains more easily than with muscles you struggle to activate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Solving AI’s Energy Problem with Kathryn Huff</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPcemHez_4g</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TPcemHez_4g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are nuclear power plants the key to a sustainable energy future? With data centers consuming massive amounts of electricity, can we keep up? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Gary O’Reilly and Paul Mecurio discuss the physics, safety, and future of nuclear reactors in a world of increasing power demands with nuclear engineer Kathryn Huff.

We start by breaking down the basics: fusion vs. fission. How does nuclear stack up against other energy sources? Are past accidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island common? Can rebranding nuclear change public perception? Kathryn walks us through the hard numbers, why its energy density makes it an attractive option, and how modern regulations have made it one of the safest power sources.

With data centers, AI, and industrial manufacturing driving massive electricity demand, can our energy production keep up? We explore the rise of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and why they may be the future of scalable, local power generation. From advanced coolants to molten salt reactors, we explore the next generation of fission that is pushing the boundaries of efficiency.

But what about nuclear waste? Kathryn explains how spent fuel recycling could reduce waste and even provide materials for medical imaging. We also examine the geopolitical challenges of uranium sourcing and the need for international collaboration. Plus, what would it take to power your house with its own nuclear reactor? Spoiler: It’s not as simple as plugging in a Mr. Fusion.

Finally, we take a cosmic perspective on energy: Was the future we imagined in the Atomic Age derailed by the rise of information technology? Are we on the cusp of a new energy revolution? All this, plus Neil’s take on the wildest misconceptions about nuclear power, in an electrifying episode you don’t want to miss.

Highlights from Torvalds' response:

The fact is, the pull request you objected to DID NOT TOUCH THE DMA LAYER AT ALL. It was literally just another user of it, in a completely separate subdirectory, that didn't change the code you maintain in _any_ way, shape, or form... Honestly, what you have been doing is basically saying "as a DMA maintainer I control what the DMA code is used for". 

And that is not how *any* of this works. What's next? Saying that particular drivers can't do DMA, because you don't like that device, and as a DMA maintainer you control who can use the DMA code? That's _literally_ exactly what you are trying to do with the Rust code. You are saying that you disagree with Rust — which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain... 

You don't have to like Rust. You don't have to care about it. That's been made clear pretty much from the very beginning, that nobody is forced to suddenly have to learn a new language, and that people who want to work purely on the C side can very much continue to do so. So to get back to the very core of your statement: 

 "The document claims no subsystem is forced to take Rust" 

that is very much true. You are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it... 

You can't have it both ways. You can't say "I want to have nothing to do with Rust", and then in the very next sentence say "And that means that the Rust code that I will ignore cannot use the C interfaces I maintain".... So when you change the C interfaces, the Rust people will have to deal with the fallout, and will have to fix the Rust bindings. That's kind of the promise here: there's that "wall of protection" around C developers that don't want to deal with Rust issues in the promise that they don't *have* to deal with Rust. 

But that "wall of protection" basically goes both ways. If you don't want to deal with the Rust code, you get no *say* on the Rust code. Put another way: the "nobody is forced to deal with Rust" does not imply "everybody is allowed to veto any Rust code".
 
Torvalds also made sure to add some kind remarks, including "I respect you technically, and I like working with you."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Challenge with Voice Agents</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Challenge-with-Voice-Agents-e2v7kj7</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98865191/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-22%2F395336812-44100-2-5e30b9d18237d.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:50:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode Two, Demetrios, Paul, and Floris explore the latest in Voice AI agents.

But Cabernet dares to go deeper with its message, delving into the cyclical nature of humanity's cruelty to each other, especially regarding the treatment of the lower class, and how society's many ills are often the result of the new rich inheriting the evils of the old. It all makes for a deeply compelling consequence-driven story where every choice carries the potential to surprise you with terrifying force. Some late-game glitches mar the game's fantastic conclusion, but even if developer Party for Introverts doesn't address those issues in post-launch updates, the journey to get to Cabernet's final hour is an incredible piece of interactive fiction.A 2D narrative-driven RPG set in 19th century Eastern Europe, Cabernet begins with protagonist Liza's funeral, as you briefly roleplay as her uncle and give a eulogy that determines the direction of Liza's life and which skills she specializes in. Control then shifts to Liza as you awake in a dungeon. Unsure of how she got there, Liza makes a pact with an unseen and silent presence for freedom, before finding herself at a party filled with vampires. It quickly becomes apparent that she is now a vampire as well, and this new life comes with a ton of rules, like needing to satiate a constant thirst for blood and staying away from sunlight. But there are immense freedoms associated with the transformation as well, as Liza is empowered with supernatural abilities that allow her to go to places she never could before, get away with acts others are often swiftly arrested for, and pursue passions and love most mortals of her station cannot yet readily do.In this sense, Liza is a stand-in for the middle class, which was emerging during this period in real-life history. Liza cannot relate to the centuries-old Countess who commands all the vampires in the region and lives in a mansion filled with wealth, nor can she completely empathize with the poor farmer girl who dreams of learning music and bettering herself but must toil away in the fields for hours so her family can eat. But Liza can take small steps into both of their worlds to see their respective trials and tribulations, and although she cannot fundamentally change the relationship between the poor and rich, she is one of the few in town who can affect the lives of people in both social spheres. This setup grounds the otherwise supernatural fantasy in real-world politics, implementing considerations into the story that give even the simplest of choices substantial narrative weight.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>As the Kernel Turns: Rust in Linux saga reaches the “Linus in all-caps” phase</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/linux-leaders-pave-a-path-for-rust-in-kernel-while-supporting-c-veterans/</link><author>Kevin Purdy</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-566440151-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:55:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rust, a modern and notably more memory-safe language than C, once seemed like it was on a steady, calm, and gradual approach into the Linux kernel.By late 2024, however, Rust enthusiasts were frustrated with stalls and blocks on their efforts, with the Rust for Linux lead quitting over "nontechnical nonsense."

A little over an hour later, the people behind the email flood had burrowed into the nether reaches of the company's network. This is a story about how such intrusions are occurring faster than ever before and the tactics that make this speed possible.The speed and precision of the attack—laid out in posts published Thursday and last month—are crucial elements for success. As awareness of ransomware attacks increases, security companies and their customers have grown savvier at detecting breach attempts and stopping them before they gain entry to sensitive data. To succeed, attackers have to move ever faster.ReliaQuest, the security firm that responded to this intrusion, said it tracked a 22 percent reduction in the “breakout time” threat actors took in 2024 compared with a year earlier. In the attack at hand, the breakout time—meaning the time span from the moment of initial access to lateral movement inside the network—was just 48 minutes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Natalie Morales Discovers Her Third Great Grandfather Had 13 Children! | Finding Your Roots | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6pfRvXG1l0</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/S6pfRvXG1l0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:00:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/3TA8505 | #FindingYourRoots

We discussed a topic that I believe isn’t covered enough: how to get strong without necessarily adding muscle size. Many people don’t want to be much bigger, but most everybody wants endurance. It’s possible to train for both simultaneously. It also turns out that training for strength with low repetitions (two to five reps) is safer than training with high repetitions—if done correctly. That’s because higher repetitions fatigue the stabilizing muscles. Still, there’s a proper way to train heavy, and Pavel explains it.

Hypertrophy training, or training for muscle size, is far more draining to the systemic nervous system than most people realize. So if you struggle with post-workout fatigue or experience brain fog later in the day, you might try training with heavier weights and lower repetitions for a while, focusing on strength instead.

We also discussed the longevity benefits of training for strength and endurance. And for those who want to add muscle size, Pavel explains shorter workouts that can be used to augment a strength program while minimizing inroads to recovery.

Additionally, we covered how to build flexibility, all with minimal time investment. Pavel is a true expert and a no-frills instructor. There’s something for everyone in this episode—it definitely applies to both women and men.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline: TV - The 90s (Teaser Trailer)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca8eN9CXqc0</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ca8eN9CXqc0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Coming soon!

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke projects AI could soon generate 80-90% of corporate code, transforming developers into "conductors of an AI-empowered orchestra" who guide and direct these systems. 

Current AI coding tools, including Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, are delivering 10-30% productivity gains in business environments. At KPMG, developers report saving 4.5 hours weekly using Copilot, while venture investment in AI coding assistants tripled to $1.6 billion in 2024. The tools are particularly effective at automating routine tasks like documentation generation and legacy code translation, according to KPMG AI expert Swami Chandrasekaran. 

They're also accelerating onboarding for new team members. Demand for junior developers remains soft, however, though analysts say it's premature to attribute this directly to AI adoption. Training programs like Per Scholas are already adapting, incorporating AI fundamentals alongside traditional programming basics to prepare developers for an increasingly AI-augmented workplace.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Not James! - RxCKSTxR Comedy Voiceover</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aZwOXO3e2s</link><author>RxCKSTxR</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7aZwOXO3e2s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 14:30:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnE9NodOn_dguyg5_yZXwQ">RxCKSTxR</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Software Engineering Job Openings Hit Five-Year Low</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/21/111216/software-engineering-job-openings-hit-five-year-low?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Software engineering job listings have plummeted to a five-year low, with postings on Indeed dropping to 65% of January 2020 levels -- a steeper decline than any other tech-adjacent field. According to data from Indeed's job aggregator, software development positions are now at 3.5x fewer vacancies compared to their mid-2022 peak and 8% lower than a year ago. 

The decline appears driven by multiple factors including widespread adoption of AI coding tools -- with 75% of engineers reporting use of AI assistance -- and a broader tech industry recalibration after aggressive pandemic-era hiring. Notable tech companies like Salesforce are maintaining flat engineering headcount while reporting 30% productivity gains from AI tools, according to an analysis by software engineer Gergely Orosz. 

While the overall job market shows 10% growth since 2020, software development joins other tech-focused sectors in decline: marketing (-19%), hospitality (-18%), and banking/finance (-7%). Traditional sectors like construction (+25%), accounting (+24%), and electrical engineering (+20%) have grown significantly in the same period, he wrote. The trend extends beyond U.S. borders, with Canada showing nearly identical patterns. European markets and Australia demonstrate more resilience, though still below peak levels.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How To Survive the News | Bill Weir</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-43Qyg85EA</link><author>10% Happier</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2-43Qyg85EA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3AWCFuxotrXmgqUHQdwyg">Podcast - 10% Happier</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A node of sanity in these challenging times.

I discuss the sources of testosterone and estrogen and how their levels fluctuate with age in both males and females. I also cover how behaviors such as exercise, cold and heat exposure, light exposure, illness, and breathing patterns affect hormones. Additionally, I examine specific supplements and replacement therapies, highlighting important precautions to consider when adjusting hormone levels.

Huberman Lab Essentials episodes are approximately 30 minutes long and focus on key scientific insights and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. These short episodes will be released every Thursday, while our full-length episodes will continue to be released every Monday.

Making headlines around the world, Brent Seales and his team of computer scientists set out on a mission to read the 2,000-year-old carbonized scrolls found in the remains of a villa in Herculaneum. Mt. Vesuvius’s eruption in 79 AD transformed the papyri, fusing together the layers of the scrolls and making them impossible to read. Can particle physics and AI finally reveal what the scrolls say?

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This technology made the f-14 possible</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7wjB-UQywk</link><author>Real Engineering</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q7wjB-UQywk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:39:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg">Real Engineering</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Can Write Code But Lacks Engineer&apos;s Instinct, OpenAI Study Finds</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/19/1212257/ai-can-write-code-but-lacks-engineers-instinct-openai-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Leading AI models can fix broken code, but they're nowhere near ready to replace human software engineers, according to extensive testing [PDF] by OpenAI researchers. The company's latest study put AI models and systems through their paces on real-world programming tasks, with even the most advanced models solving only a quarter of typical engineering challenges. 

The research team created a test called SWE-Lancer, drawing from 1,488 actual software fixes made to Expensify's codebase, representing $1 million worth of freelance engineering work. When faced with these everyday programming tasks, the best AI model â" Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- managed to complete just 26.2% of hands-on coding tasks and 44.9% of technical management decisions. 

Though the AI systems proved adept at quickly finding relevant code sections, they stumbled when it came to understanding how different parts of software interact. The models often suggested surface-level fixes without grasping the deeper implications of their changes. 

The research, to be sure, used a set of complex methodologies to test the AI coding abilities. Instead of relying on simplified programming puzzles, OpenAI's benchmark uses complete software engineering tasks that range from quick $50 bug fixes to complex $32,000 feature implementations. Each solution was verified through rigorous end-to-end testing that simulated real user interactions, the researchers said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Distant Call by Joseph Goldstein</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxX3KEXI74</link><author>10% Happier</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eTxX3KEXI74?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:51:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3AWCFuxotrXmgqUHQdwyg">Podcast - 10% Happier</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.

In 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks …. good!

But de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.

Here’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.

But the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.

It’s been 75 years since China invaded Tibet, the mountain territory it has long claimed as its own.

China heavily restricts the international media’s access to the region. It insists that human rights are at their “historical best,” and that Tibetans’ religious freedoms are being protected, but the footage and first-person accounts from exiled Tibetan interviewees in FRONTLINE’s “Battle for Tibet” paint a different picture.

The documentary investigates the Chinese Communist Party’s rule over the tightly-controlled territory and the struggle over the survival of Tibetan language, culture and religion.

The film examines China’s branding of the Dalai Lama as an anti-China separatist, despite his repeated statements that he is no longer seeking Tibetan independence and would accept self-rule within China — and explores China’s pursuit of a campaign to choose his successor. 

China insists that life in Tibet is “significantly better” for the people there because of its rule, which it says must continue. 

“Battle for Tibet” is a Hardcash production with GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV. The director and producer is Gesbeen Mohammad. The senior producers are Dan Edge and Eamonn Matthews. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

He also says Linus Torvalds has privately stated he will override objections to Rust code, effectively making its adoption inevitable. Phoronix's Michael Larabel has the latest: The latest on Hellwig's perspective of Rust code within the Linux kernel is below. Some interesting insight from a dissenting view. The thread in full can be found on the Rust for Linux mailing list.
 
[Here's an excerpt from the thread:] "I don't think having a web page in any form is useful. If you want it to be valid it has to be in the kernel tree and widely agreed on. It also states factually incorrect information. E.g. 'Some subsystems may decide they do not want to have Rust code for the time being, typically for bandwidth reasons. This is fine and expected.' while Linus in private said that he absolutely is going to merge Rust code over a maintainers objection. (He did so in private in case you are looking for a reference). So as of now, as a Linux developer or maintainer you must deal with Rust if you want to or not. [...] Right now the rules is Linus can force you whatever he wants (it's his project obviously) and I think he needs to spell that out including the expectations for contributors very clearly." 

Inevitably there was a response... Torvalds: Rust Kernel Code Isn't Forced In Over Maintainers' Objections.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>USS Yorktown: What Life Was Like Onboard An Aircraft Carrier During WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSv2HLkHEN0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VSv2HLkHEN0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Fighting Lady is a 1944 documentary film directed by Edward Steichen, produced by the U.S. Navy and narrated by Lt.

It used to be that the first step of data science was to get familiar with your data. However, as modern LLM datasets have gotten larger, dataset exploration tools have not kept up. Kenny makes the case that user interfaces have been under-appreciated in the Python-centric world of AI, and new tools are needed to enable advances in machine learning. Our conversation also dives into new methods of using LLM models themselves to assist data engineers in actually looking at their data.Kenny has been working in AI for over 20 years. First in academia as a ML Ph.D. student at USC (before it was cool). Kenny then co-founded Algorithmia to solve the problem of hosting and distribution of ML models running on GPUs (also before it was cool). Algortihmia was an early pioneer of the MLOps space and was acquired by DataRobot in 2021. Kenny is currently founder and CEO of Hyperparam, building new tools to make AI dataset curation orders of magnitude more efficient. ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Google Interview Question Everyone Gets Wrong</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFVrncgIvos</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dFVrncgIvos?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:03:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you smart enough to solve this Google interview question?

When reading "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," most readers visualize the queen’s croquet game play out in their heads. A few might see the scene in vivid detail. However, a small fraction of readers have a drastically different experience: within their heads, they "see" absolutely nothing. Why do some people have an inability to visualize images? Adam Zeman explores the science of aphantasia.

Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is exactly as it sounds, with Goro Majima returning as a fully fledged protagonist for the first time since 2015's Yakuza 0. Unlike that game--which saw Kiryu share the spotlight--the focus this time around is squarely on everyone's favorite eyepatched goofball: the perfect leading man for one of the series' more bizarre entries. No one commits to the bit quite like Majima, which is partly why Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii avoids the risk of diminishing returns, despite being the third Like a Dragon game in the past 15 months. This high-seas adventure doesn't stack up against the series' best, but the pirate theme does just enough to differentiate a jaunty return to the Hawaii.Set six months after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii opens with Majima waking up on a beach somewhere in the Pacific. He has no memory of how he got there, his name, or his storied past as a crime boss/cabaret manager/construction-company owner. All he knows is that a young boy named Noah saved his life, and for whatever reason, Hawaii and the surrounding islands are now full of cutlass-wielding pirates who look like they've been pulled out of Tortuga during the 1600s. What follows is the hunt for a long-lost legendary treasure that sees Majima reinvent himself as the pirate captain of his own ship, complete with an ever-expanding crew of new and familiar characters. Stuffing the coffers with booty might be the end goal, but this is also a tale about the friends we made along the way.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Easiest Flooring You&apos;ll Ever Install || Beginner DIY</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfIXGB0aSYE</link><author>Mr. Build It</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xfIXGB0aSYE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:44:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCziz6FiCnkyQ810X7qXFMZw">Mr. Build It</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try the new Radon Plus Sensor by clicking https://bit.ly/4h69PYA.

This caused a great deal of outcry from the Enterprise Linux community at large. Since then many have waited for a statement from the Free Software Foundation concerning their stance on the matter. Now, nearly two years later the FSF has finally responded to questions regarding their stance on the issue with the following statement: Generally, we don't agree with what Red Hat is doing. Whether it constitutes a violation of the GPL would require legal analysis and the FSF does not give legal advice. However, as the stewards of the GNU GPL we can speak how it is intended to be applied and Red Hat's approach is certainly contrary to the spirit of the GPL. This is unfortunate, because we would expect such flagship organizations to drive the movement forward.

Larry Jin is the VP of Product Management at Docusign and previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

Has a show ever been as wholesome, precious, and widely loved? As it turns out, the real-life Bradys weren't so wholesome after all. Behind the scenes, the TV family was embroiled in addiction and anguish that was frequently at odds with their carefully crafted image.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It’s a Love Hate Relationship! - RxCKSTxR Comedy Voiceover</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqwkGdlgRM0</link><author>RxCKSTxR</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SqwkGdlgRM0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:40:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnE9NodOn_dguyg5_yZXwQ">RxCKSTxR</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is The Perfect Bowling Strategy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqo1lQL59VI</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mqo1lQL59VI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the optimal strategy for bowling? #science #veritasium #physics #bowling]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SOGCast 032: Cliff Newman: Survived First SOG HALO Combat Jump into Laos in the Rain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0-nhVWQh0c</link><author>Jocko Podcast</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/j0-nhVWQh0c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqcY4CAuBFNFho6JgygCnA">Jocko Podcast</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More from J.

It is a symptom of how complex workflow orchestration has gotten. Is it a dominant trend or will we cycle back to “DAG specifications”? At Stitchfix, we had our own DSL that “compiled” into airflow DAGs and at MicroByre, we used a external workflow langauge.

They say fusion is 50 years away, no matter when you ask. Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.

From the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome’s port city of Ostia to local shrines and colossal structures like the Pantheon, the ancient Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods, some local and others imported from across the Mediterranean.

One key feature of Roman religion was its ability to adapt and innovate. New gods were welcomed into the Roman pantheon, often from the peoples Rome conquered or traded with, such as the Egyptian goddess Isis, who became immensely popular by the Imperial period and received a large temple in the Campus Martius. Another example is Mithras, a mysterious god with Persian origins whose worship involved secret underground rituals and appealed particularly to Roman soldiers.

Public temples were monumental structures that marked sacred spaces. They served both religious and practical functions, often housing libraries, halls, and spaces for the public to gather. Temples were dedicated to the well-being of the state, such as the Temple of Saturn, which doubled as the city treasury, or the Temple of Castor and Pollux, linked to military victories.

Hidden away since his death, they chart his life on the front during the first world war where he served on the western front against the French and English from 1914 to 1918. 

Writing on the morning of the 11th November, Wilhelm reveals in depth his and his comrades feelings and thoughts about the armistice - giving us never before heard insight into those final moments.

His letters and diaries from 1929 onwards reveal the rise of Hitler and the Nazis and his own involvement and ultimately the defeat of Nazi Germany and his own experience of the denazification process.

Its fantasy world isn't as expansive and seamlessly stitched together, but you'd be forgiven for confusing the two at a glance, especially when you're engaged in its first-person combat. Avowed lifts some of the best aspects of the seminal RPG and improves them, especially when it comes to its refined combat. These changes extend to a move away from traditional leveling in favor of a gear-focused approach, as well as the option to experiment with wild weapon combinations. But not all of Avowed's experiments are successes, leading to an uneven role-playing adventure that surprises as much as it frustrates.Washing up on the shores of the Living Lands, you play as one the Godlike: a select few kissed by the grace of a god at birth and left with some distinct (and sometimes frightening) facial features to show for it. On a mission from a distant monarch whose influence within the Living Lands has many of its inhabitants up in arms, your job is to track down the source of a plague that's turning the land's people into mindless, bloodthirsty creatures, before it manages to make it back home. Although it is set in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, Avowed does a good job of immediately siloing you into an area that requires little knowledge of what is happening across the ocean, but does reference some historical events from time to time. A glossary of important names and places is available as they're brought up in conversation, providing a handy guide that contextualizes some attitudes characters have to certain factions and events around you.Avowed makes a strong initial impression, quickly establishing your Godlike status but with the odd quirk of being the first not to know which god chose you. This isn't the main purpose of your mission, but that changes after a surprising event in the early hours of the game that sets the stage for a more intriguing answer to the plague ravaging the Living Lands. This setup is ultimately squandered, however, with the two big narrative hooks coalescing with one another in routinely expected and uninteresting ways, making the broader strokes of the story largely forgettable. The conversational writing does have its moments of charm, with equally serious and snarky retorts letting you inject some levity into otherwise dire situations with great comedic effect. But the severity of the plague you're trying to stop and the personal journey of finding out why you're the only Godlike without a god is not as captivating as it could be, taking steps along a narrative path that rarely deviates into surprising avenues.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Hormones Shape Sexual Development | Huberman Lab Essentials</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCFQx3cA0Lg</link><author>Andrew Huberman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FCFQx3cA0Lg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">Podcast - Huberman Lab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain the crucial role hormones play in shaping the sexual development of both the brain and body.

I discuss how biological masculinization and feminization depend on factors such as genetics, hormone ratios, and receptor availability. I also explore how hormones like testosterone, estrogen, and other steroid hormones influence sexual characteristics and brain development. Additionally, I examine the impact of environmental factors—such as herbicides like atrazine, cannabis, alcohol, and even cell phones—on hormone function and reproductive health.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on key science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials are released every Thursday, while full-length episodes continue to be released every Monday.

Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.
 
The programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as "Activities," you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.
 
I remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind. Perhaps in a future, GNOME could return to the Linux desktop and join forces with Cinnamon -- so that we may once again have the year of the Linux desktop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fostering open source culture (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/628</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/628/the-changelog-628.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Arun Gupta is back, this time with his latest book in hand titled “Fostering Open Source Culture” to share his wisdom and experiences of fostering open source culture.

--

After witnessing a bird carrying a single golden hair, King Mark of Cornwall declared his future bride must have equally radiant locks. The only royal matching this description was Princess Isolde of Ireland. So the king sent Tristan, his bravest knight, to extend an olive branch to the royal family and deliver his proposal of marriage. Iseult Gillespie shares the tale of Tristan and Isolde.

In 2021, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, avian flu began aggressively circulating in wildlife. Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn’t stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It’s an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we’re not worried now, when should we be?

We discuss the most effective and efficient ways to build strength, endurance, and flexibility. We cover bodyweight-only, free-weight, and machine-based protocols and describe training splits and lesser-known but highly effective ways to train, especially for people with limited time.

We also discuss local versus systemic nervous system and muscle recovery, how to complete training sessions with increased energy, why training to “failure” is not advised, optimal rest-between-sets protocols to improve performance, and how to vary effort levels across each week and month to ensure regular progress. This episode brings you highly practical, science-supported, and real-world-tested training methods to build strength, endurance, and flexibility from one of the world’s top experts.

Only eight people remain in the core team around Rust for Linux... Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. 
The reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: 

- "2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers..." — Daniel Almedia 

- "I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time." — Andrea Righi

 - "[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs." — Carlos Bilbao 

- "I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete..." Steven Rostedt 

Rostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. "I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language." 

But still "contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps," argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:

"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain." 

But the article also notes that Google "has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones."
The use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. "Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones," Ojeda told me after his talk. 

In addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as "maintainers become more comfortable with it," Ojeda told me. "Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now," Ojeda said. "If they could drop C, they would do it...." 

Amid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Strange New York Island That’s Completely Abandoned</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upkTsBc-yr0</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/upkTsBc-yr0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 15:01:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[New York.

Robustness, Detectability, and Data Privacy in AI // MLOps Podcast #289 with Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Student Researcher at Google DeepMind.

// Abstract
Recent rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made it widely applicable across various domains, from autonomous systems to multimodal content generation. However, these models remain susceptible to significant security and safety vulnerabilities. Such weaknesses can enable attackers to jailbreak systems, allowing them to perform harmful tasks or leak sensitive information. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical applications like autonomous robotics and healthcare, the importance of ensuring AI safety is growing. Understanding the vulnerabilities in today’s AI systems is crucial to addressing these concerns.

// Bio
Vinu Sankar Sadasivan is a final-year Computer Science PhD candidate at The University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi. His research focuses on Security and Privacy in AI, with a particular emphasis on AI robustness, detectability, and user privacy. Currently, Vinu is a full-time Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, working on jailbreaking multimodal AI models. Previously, Vinu was a Research Scientist intern at Meta FAIR in Paris, where he worked on AI watermarking.

Apple/ARM platform development will continue downstream. If I feel like sending some patches upstream in the future myself for whatever subtree I may, or I may not. Anyone who feels like fighting the upstreaming fight themselves is welcome to do so. 

The Register points out that the action follows this interaction with Linux Torvalds. 
Hector Martin: If shaming on social media does not work, then tell me what does,
because I'm out of ideas. 
Linus Torvalds: How about you accept the fact that maybe the problem is you. You think you know better. But the current process works. It has problems, but problems are a fact of life. There is no perfect. However, I will say that the social media brigading just makes me not
want to have anything at all to do with your approach. Because if we have issues in the kernel development model, then social media sure as hell isn't the solution.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are your fingerprints really unique?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZWQonLN2xk</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IZWQonLN2xk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new AI tool says it can detect similarities in fingerprints that humans can't.

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known.
