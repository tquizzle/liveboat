Most women experience this type of sex drive—so why is no one talking about it? 🤯

In this episode of The Mel Robbins Podcast, I’m joined by licensed psychotherapist and sex therapist Vanessa Marin (@vanessaandxander ) for a no-BS, shame-free conversation about how to have the best sex of your life.

Whether you’re single, in a relationship, or married, this episode will change the way you think about sex and inspire you to prioritize pleasure, intimacy, and connection—at any age and in any relationship.

Brother Pháp Dung discusses the life and teachings of Vietnamese Zen master, peace activist, poet, and author Thich Nhat Hanh.

In January 2022, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Zen master, peace activist, poet, and author passed away. He was the founder of the International Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called him “an Apostle of peace and nonviolence” when nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thousands of people came out for his funeral.   

Brother Pháp Dung is making his second appearance on the show to talk about Thich Nhat Hanh. If you missed it last time he was on, Brother Pháp Dung has an incredible personal story. He was born in Vietnam in 1969 and came to the US at the age of nine. He worked as an architect/designer for four years before becoming a monk. He was very close personally with Thich Nhat Hanh, who he refers to as “Thây,” or teacher, and is now a Dharma teacher himself in Thich Nhat Hanh’s Plum Village tradition.

This episode was first released in March 2022.

I explain why overheating can hinder performance and endurance and how techniques like palmar cooling can help extend physical effort by aiding temperature regulation. I also highlight how specific body areas, such as the palms and face, are key targets for regulating temperature, allowing heat to dissipate efficiently. Lastly, I discuss how temperature can support training recovery while cautioning that extreme cold, such as ice baths immediately after training, can block adaptations.

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes—approximately 30 minutes—focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

In this episode, you are going to learn how to have amazing sex, deeper intimacy, and create real, lasting love. 

If you feel like intimacy with your partner is rare, your desire is low, or that your marriage is even sexless, this conversation is for you. 

Here to deliver the most important sex advice you need to hear is renowned sex therapist and bestselling author, Vanessa Marin.  

Vanessa Marin is a licensed psychotherapist and a sex therapist with over 20 years of clinical experience helping people have healthier, more satisfying sex lives. She is known for her viral, no-shame, straight-to-the-point advice on how to have the best sex of your life. 

This conversation tackles everything you weren’t taught—and probably aren’t talking about—when it comes to sex. Mel also shares openly about her own sex life, difficulties with intimacy, and speaks openly in a way you’ve never heard before.

Whether you are single, in a relationship, or married, this conversation is going to make you think differently about sex and inspire you to prioritize pleasure and connection in bed, no matter your age, relationship status, or gender. 

You’ll learn:
-The real reason you feel disconnected in your sex life
-The two different types of sex drives and why it matters 
-What to do if you’re on your way to a dry bedroom
-What exactly to say if you’re not in the mood when your partner initiates sex

If you feel like you can’t talk about sex, if you can’t ask for what you want, don’t know how to bring it up, are going through a dry spell, or want to have more sex but you’re exhausted, this episode is for you.

We discuss how to use plyometric work to improve mobility, strength, posture, and overall health.

We emphasize the enormous benefits of skipping—a form of plyometrics—for joint health, aerobic conditioning, and coordination, as well as its advantages for people of all ages and fitness levels. We also explore the expressive nature of human movement, highlighting how certain movements reveal and can evolve one’s unique personality and abilities.

Stu explains how resistance training, skipping, and striding can improve movement efficiency in all aspects of life. Anyone who exercises, as well as serious athletes, will benefit immensely from Stu McMillan’s knowledge of human mechanics and the practical tools he generously shares in this discussion.

Have you ever walked away from a conversation feeling dismissed, overlooked, or drained — but you couldn't quite put your finger on why? 

You're not imagining it. 

Disrespect is everywhere, and often, it’s so subtle that you don’t realize it’s happening until it’s already taken a toll on your confidence, energy, and peace of mind.

In today’s episode, Mel breaks down 6 sneaky ways people are disrespecting you every day — at work, in relationships, even within your own family — and, more importantly, exactly what to do about it. 

Whether it’s someone constantly talking over you, dismissing your feelings, or always running late (yep, that’s disrespectful, too), you’ll learn how to respond in a way that protects your energy and commands the respect you deserve.

If you’re tired of feeling unseen, unheard, or undervalued, this is the episode for you.
