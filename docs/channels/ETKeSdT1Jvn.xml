I discuss the pathways through which the brain and body interact to produce thyroid hormone and growth hormone, and how these hormones influence essential processes like tissue growth and repair, body composition, and energy production. I explain how thyroid hormone levels are influenced by key nutrients, such as iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine. I also explain how practices such as exercise, sleep, meditation and sauna can offset age-related declines in growth hormone, to optimize overall hormone health and metabolism. 

Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

It all begins with two simple words: Let Them. 🔥

Today, you will learn why everything you thought about aging is wrong—and how to stay strong, energized, and mobile at any age. 

Dr. Vonda Wright, MD, joins Mel today to give you the wakeup call of a lifetime – one that will teach you how to look, feel, and stay young forever. 

Dr. Wright is a double board-certified orthopedic surgeon and one of the world’s leading experts on mobility, musculoskeletal aging, and longevity. Her pioneering research proves that aging doesn’t mean getting weaker—it means getting smarter about how you move. 
 
You’ll learn: 
Why everything you’ve been told about aging is a lie, and how you can be stronger, healthier, and more energized at any age. 
How to slow aging (and even reverse it) with mobility, muscle-building, and simple daily habits. 
The best exercises for overall health & longevity—and why Dr. Wright says most people focus on the wrong things. 
Why women are often misled about aging—and how to take control of your health before it’s too late. 
What doctors don’t tell you about joint pain, arthritis, and how to fix it. 

Dr. Wright will break down the exercise routine scientifically proven to change the way your body looks and feels, plus a powerful mindset shift that will completely change how you view aging. 

Whether you’re 25 or 65, this episode will give you a science-backed roadmap to staying strong, mobile, and independent for life.

Secrets from the massively popular Stanford business school course on interpersonal hygiene.

Carole Robin and David Bradford taught the most popular elective course at the Stanford Graduate School of Business for a combined total of 75 years. Officially, the name of the course is Interpersonal Dynamics, but everybody calls it “Touchy-Feely.” Together they have written the new book, Connect: Building Exceptional Relationships with Family, Friends, and Colleagues.

We dive into the six hallmarks of what they call “exceptional relationships,” how to be honest and vulnerable without overdoing it, why the questions “how am I feeling?” and “how are you feeling?” are central to improving our communication, the inevitability of risk when you set out to deepen a relationship, and why meditation is helpful in all of this.

This episode originally aired in 2021.

We discuss how IFS views the mind as a collection of parts, each shaped by different life experiences—both good and bad, including trauma. To demonstrate how IFS works, Dr. Schwartz guides Dr. Huberman and you, the listener, through an example IFS session. We also explore how IFS and body awareness can help break harmful thought and behavior patterns, promote emotional healing, and build healthier relationships.

Today, you’re getting a wake-up call that will forever change the way you see your phone, your attention, and your time. 

Mel is pulling back the curtain on the hidden game that Big Tech is playing with your brain—one designed to hijack your focus, drain your energy, and keep you scrolling so they can profit off of you. 

But here’s the good news: once you see the game for what it is, you can stop losing and start winning. 

In this episode, you’ll learn why you feel exhausted after scrolling, why you can’t stop checking your phone, and how social media is manipulating you in ways you don’t even realize. 

Mel breaks down the science of dopamine, motivation, and attention—and how simple, research-backed changes can help you reclaim control. 

Mel also shares her conversation with renowned psychiatrist Dr. Alok Kanojia, also known as Dr. K, who reveals the shocking truth about what your phone is doing to your brain—and how to undo the damage starting today. 

By the end, you’ll have the tools to take your power back, set boundaries with technology, and start using your phone as a tool rather than being the tool. 

If you’re tired of feeling distracted, overwhelmed, and drained, this episode is the wake-up call you need.

Chiara highlights how agents can dynamically blend both approaches, while Steven predicts specialized agents will dominate initially before trust in generic agents grows. The panel also examines how e-commerce platforms may resist but eventually collaborate with AI agents. Trust remains a key factor in adoption, with opportunities emerging for new agent-driven business models.
