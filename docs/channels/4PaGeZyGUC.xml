Sometimes a Landscape painting is anything but a painting of a landscape. 

This is a film about Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco, an artist who specialised in incredibly detailed landscapes, and was once a household name - but now is practically unknown outside the country of his birth, Mexico.

When thinking about Mexican nationalism and cultural identity, figures like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera often take centre stage. Their iconic works have become synonymous with Mexican art. However, Velasco‚Äôs landscapes, particularly The Valley of Mexico, are often overlooked in these discussions.

Male circumcision is done for religious, cultural or medical reasons.

In Africa, the WHO used male circumcision in the fight against AIDS. But more and more doctors say that the harm done by the procedure outweighs any medical benefits, and that this surgery is performed far too often.
Those affected are increasingly daring to go public, demanding that boys, too, be protected from circumcisions that are not medically necessary. Advocates say their right to physical integrity must be preserved. 
But few take it as far as Florian. He‚Äôs sure that his circumcision as a child wasn‚Äôt medically necessary. Moreover, his parents were not informed about alternative options. He‚Äôs taking his case to court.
The film explores the question of when circumcision actually makes  medical sense, and critically questions the ethics of this millennia-old practice.

This set the stage for the catastrophic LA fires in January 2025. Two years of heavy rainfall spurred rapid vegetation growth, only for eight months of extreme drought to transform that vegetation into a tinderbox. When high winds swept through, all it took was a spark for LA to ignite.

ABSTRACT
Why are companies quietly using languages like Elm, OCaml, and Haskell?

No development department gets in trouble for going with industry standard languages, but that also means there is sometimes space to gain a considerable advantage over your competetion through language selection.

Drawing from notable success stories like Jane Street, Standard Chartered, Corvus, and Vendr, we will evaluate typed functional languages from a business perspective: What are the concrete business advantages gained by the companies using typed functional languages? When are these advantages likely (and unlikely) to translate to other businesses? And how can a business responsibly evaluate if the same advantages are available in their particular case? [...]

#F1 #F1Sprint #ChineseGP]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jean-Yves Thibaudet: Tiny Desk Concert</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlv4wrfKl4Y</link><author>NPR Music</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jlv4wrfKl4Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:00:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A">NPR Music</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tom Huizenga | March 21, 2025
When Jean-Yves Thibaudet visited NPR to play a Tiny Desk, everything about him was stylish. His shoes were custom made for him by the late Vivienne Westwood, his jacket was by Simon Porte Jacquemus, his necklace, Cartier.

When he sat down to play, arguably only one thing seemed to be missing: a shiny, 9-foot grand piano. But Thibaudet, like many great pianists who have graced our office space, understands the vibe of our beloved little concert series. He knows that the point is not to be playing on the largest piano possible. Instead, he delighted in bringing music by Villa-Lobos, Brahms and Ravel to our diminutive ‚Äî but meticulously groomed ‚Äî upright. And the colors and textures he conjured from that trusty box of wood and wire was unforgettable.

Thibaudet begins with a firecracker of a piece from the early 20th century ‚Äî two-minutes of effervescence by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Watch the pianist‚Äôs fingers in a blur, stabbing hundreds of notes like a sewing machine. It was an encore favorite of the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Thibaudet explains.    

What follows could not be more different. The Intermezzo Op. 118, No. 2, is classic late Brahms, filled with muted, fall afternoon light and whispered inner voices. Thibaudet ends with a tribute to one of his idols, Maurice Ravel, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated far and wide. Turns out that one of the composer‚Äôs biggest hits, the Pavane for a Dead Princess, was not among his own favorites. And the evocative title was merely tacked on as a poetic afterthought. Still, the wide palette of coloring and shading Thibaudet offers is a masterclass in how to make an upright piano sound like a symphony orchestra. 

SET LIST
Heitor Villa-Lobos: ‚ÄúO polichinelo‚Äù (from A prole do beb√™ No. 1)
Johannes Brahms: Intermezzo in A major, Op. 118, No. 2

The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.

She had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: "Woman, Life, Freedom‚Äù.

Iranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.

For example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.

Dublin is particularly affected. The few properties that are left can only be rented at extremely high prices. Fewer and fewer people can afford to live in the city. 

Not only are rents increasing, so is homelessness. Ireland‚Äôs housing market has been a problem since the 2008 financial crisis.

DESCRIPTION
Sarah Wells and Anne Currie dive into ‚ÄúThe Cloud Native Attitude‚Äù and uncover why it‚Äôs more than just using cloud infrastructure. It‚Äôs about breaking bottlenecks, embracing rapid change, and aligning the entire organization.

Anne reflects on how Kubernetes has risen since the book‚Äôs first edition, but the core principles remain. They discuss why CI/CD is key, how cloud native supports sustainability, and why true transformation demands more than just a lift-and-shift. The conversation wraps up with practical advice on identifying real bottlenecks and securing buy-in for a successful cloud native journey.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today‚Äôs older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#DeskOfTheDay: &quot;girls can&apos;t play the guitar,&quot; Strapless</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7LURW_TpI</link><author>NPR Music</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Bo7LURW_TpI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:56:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A">NPR Music</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's #DeskOfTheDay is "girls can't play the guitar" by @Strapless_band  from Providence, RI.!

Cordae has called a few places home during his 27 years, but he's always repped the DMV as an emcee. "This is a hometown show for me, so I'm expecting a biased amount of love from y'all!" Home-court advantage never hurts at the Tiny Desk, but Cordae had a few more tricks up his sleeve. He rolled in deep with a host of musicians and singers, some from the D.C. area and all rocking vintage graphic t-shirts featuring artists that have inspired the rapper. Cordae's meticulous approach to music was evident, and the band was on point by the time soundcheck started.

Cordae has always shined as a masterful storyteller. On The Crossroads, he graduates from origin and neighborhood tales to the adjustment of newfound fame and fatherhood ‚Äî most of this set comes from that album. But he does take us back to his early days on "06 dreamin," a song about his mother's aspirations as a singer that samples one of her original recordings. In a rare and sweet Tiny Desk moment, he shares his big break and brings his mom, Jennifer Dunston, up to sing with him.
