The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.

To many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. 

The public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn’t see his family for months so as not to infect them.

When the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.

By now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aurélie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aurélie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.

As the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?

It is estimated that around 10 women and girls are killed every day by intimate partners or other family members. 

Another alarming statistic is the impunity rate of these crimes. Only 2% of cases end in a criminal sentence and only one in 10 victims dares to report their aggressor.

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.

Four women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan’s hard-won rights. 

The team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.

ABSTRACT
Several of the leading Continuous Delivery tool vendors have been under attack, including CircleCI, TeamCity and most recently Jenkins. These Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery tools are an important part of the supply chain, and supply chain safety. Supply chain attacks are particularly dangerous, as they may allow attackers to compromise otherwise trusted software at source.

In this episode, Dave Farley explores these recent attacks, and their consequences while describing some of the things that may help you to protect your means of production.

DESCRIPTION
Charles Humble interviews Dr. Gail Murphy about the challenges in software engineering today. They discuss how productivity isn’t just about lines of code but is more about focus and minimizing task-switching.

Gail also talks about the difficulty of managing the rapid evolution of system architectures, stressing the need for regular restructuring and refactoring to avoid issues like increased coupling and decreased performance. The conversation moves to open-source development, where Gail highlights how using open-source components can create complex, brittle dependencies, and the need for better communication within these ecosystems.

They wrap up by discussing the evolving role of technical leadership in navigating these challenges. [...]

When Megan Moroney first showed up for her Tiny Desk, decked out in a blue sequin dress and Uggs, she was fresh off winning best new artist at the Country Music Association Awards, an honor she earned for the affecting ways she blends classic country with earworm pop and confessional storytelling. The blue color scheme, also reflected on her guitar and nail polish, is a nod to the heartache and sadness found across 2024's Am I Okay?

The self-proclaimed Emo Cowgirl opens her Tiny Desk with "I'm Not Pretty" from her 2023 debut Lucky. Backed by pedal steel and sparkling harmonies, she sings about struggles with intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage and peaking in high school. Like all great country music, her songs reveal deeper and universal truths in life's smallest and messiest moments.

But Moroney's music is as much about resilience as it is grief. For this set, she also includes a version of "No Caller ID," which celebrates the friends who help you move on, as well as "Tennessee Orange," her 2022 breakout hit and ode to young love. She closes with the title cut to Am I Okay? "In my discography of sad songs," she tells the NPR Music office, "it's proof that a man was once making me happy." She quickly adds, "It's no longer true, but fun while it lasted!"

22-year-old Billie Carlton’s death caused shockwaves across the nation, adding fuel to a growing moral panic about sex, scandal and drugs.

Hosts of After Dark, Anthony and Maddy are joined by Virginia Berridge, Professor of History and Health Policy at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, to explore the path to drug criminalisation in postwar London following the death of Billie Carlton. Together, they uncover the extraordinary history of drugs in Soho - London’s most notorious neighbourhood in the 1920s.

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU’s border protection agency’s reputation. But now, it’s trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.

The message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? 
The new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He’s said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.

--

Two species of Demodex mites specifically inhabit human follicles. And not just some people’s— nearly everyone is thought to host mites. One person’s face might harbor hundreds or even thousands of individual mites. On any given day, these microscopic arachnids are probably eating, mating, and laying eggs inside your pores. So, is this… okay? M. Alejandra Perotti investigates.

That’s not new.

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

DESCRIPTION
Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion have unprecedented potential. Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.

With this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.

Learn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:
• The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between
• How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain
• The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture—and how to best interact with it
• How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code
