The only thing that helps is then restarting the process or the server. I am using a proxmox VM with Debian 12, installed AdGuard Home via the automated install (GitHub - AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome: Network-wide ads & trackers blocking DNS server), the VM was reinstalled clean twice but the problem persists. It is a naked Debian 12 without any other software installed. The vm has 4 vCPUs assigned and 4 GiB of RAM, qemu-guest-agent is installed properly. In the journalctl log, there is nothing to see at the time, AdGuard Home stops responding, the only thing thats remarkable is, that stopping the process fails with timeout:Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564208 [info] Received signal "terminated"Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564254 [info] stopping AdGuard HomeMar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564322 [info] webapi: stopping http serverMar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564422 [info] webapi: stopped http serverMar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564427 [info] service: stopping: waiting for cleanupMar 09 00:15:00 adguard systemd[1]: Stopping AdGuardHome.service - AdGuard Home: Network-level blocker...Mar 09 00:16:30 adguard systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: State 'stop-sigterm' timed out.

But a new clinical trial has repaired this damage in patients thanks to a transplant of stem cells from their healthy eyes.The cornea is the outer layer of the eye, which focuses light towards the retina. Since it’s on the frontline of potential hazards from the outside world, the cornea features a population of limbal epithelial stem cells, which repair minor damage to keep the surface smooth and functional.Unfortunately, injuries like thermal or chemical burns can damage the cornea beyond the capability of these resident stem cells. There’s not much else that can be done – even a cornea transplant won’t take hold if the damage is too severe.The new study, conducted by scientists at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, investigated a new treatment called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells (CALEC). This involves removing stem cells from a patient’s uninjured eye, growing their population in the lab for a few weeks, then surgically transplanting them into the injured eye.The phase 1/2 trial recruited 14 patients to undergo the procedure, and followed them for 18 months afterwards. Success was primarily judged by how effectively the treatment repaired the cornea’s surface, while a secondary test analyzed improvements to visual acuity.By the first checkup at three months, the corneas of seven (50%) of the participants had been completely restored. By the 12-month mark, that number had increased to 11 (79%) patients. Two other participants met the definition for partial success, so the team claims an overall success rate of 92% for CALEC.It’s worth noting that three participants did require a second transplant of stem cells, with one of them going on to reach the mark of complete success by the end of the study. In tests of visual acuity in the damaged eye, the majority of patients regained some sight, with some advancing from legally blind to low vision.No serious adverse effects that were attributed to the procedure were seen in the patients, in either the donor or recipient eyes. The researchers say that this success paves the way for further trials with larger cohorts and longer follow-ups, before CALEC is submitted for FDA approval.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Posthog/.cursorrules</title><link>https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/.cursorrules</link><author>simonpure</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:30:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My 16-month theanine self-experiment</title><link>https://dynomight.net/theanine/</link><author>dynm</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet theanine. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I liked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is there any way to change the color of code block text?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1j6xs3m/is_there_any_way_to_change_the_color_of_code/</link><author>/u/Melendrow</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 02:42:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Obsidian</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I'm using the Obuntu theme (Git hub page) and the theme changes the code block text to make it red, and I'm curious if there's any way I can change it.

Currently, the Wi-Fi MAC layer of the ESP32 is closed-source.
This project aims to change that: by reverse engineering the hardware registers and software, we can build a networking stack that is open-source up to the hardware, instead of having to use the proprietary MAC layer.This will improve security auditability, open up the possibility for features not supported in the proprietary implementation (for example, standards-compliant mesh networking), improve interoperability and make research into Wi-Fi networks with lots of nodes more affordable.esp32-open-mac (we know it's confusing that one reference implementation has the same name as the overarching project, but bear with us)
This is a reference implementation that demonstrates how the hardware works, written in C and Rust: the hardware abstraction and initialization is written in C; the MAC stack (parsing packets and deciding which packets to send when) is written in Rust.
This relies on two FreeRTOS tasks; one to handle the hardware, one to handle the MAC stack.Ferris-on-Air (FoA): this is a reference implementation in pure async Rust. It builds on Embassy and the patches in the esp-hal we submitted to add support for the Wi-Fi peripheral.If you want to help out with developing or want to contact us, feel free to join the Matrix room]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built an app to get daily wisdom from Mr. Worldwide</title><link>https://daale.club/</link><author>garyreckon</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 00:04:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GOD BLESS AMERICA EVERYONE</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1j6umun/god_bless_america_everyone/</link><author>/u/NirvanaHero404</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 23:57:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpt/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - ChatGPT</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Journey through Hogwarts But Miniature</title><link>https://v.redd.it/oqprru50wjne1</link><author>/u/Sad-Ambassador-9040</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 23:30:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpt/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - ChatGPT</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Forced air cooling upgrade for the closet lab</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1j6t43h/forced_air_cooling_upgrade_for_the_closet_lab/</link><author>/u/CStoEE</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 22:44:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I added a jumper duct to my coat closet lab.

It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. 

"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox," reports the Register.
 Axiom Space said: "The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity." 

Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: "Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency...." 

The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... "AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years." 
The article notes that HPE has also "sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers — commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers — over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions." (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) "At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program." 

Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to "reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis."

By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. 
The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup & disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.

For my example, I'll use my Xbox Core Wireless Controller. The expected behavior that happens on all other computers is as follows:Controller is put into pairing mode, LED begins to flash quickly.Controller becomes visible to computer, and is listed under devices that can be paired.I select the controller to pair it.Computer says pairing is successful. LED on controller stops flashing and holds solid.Controller functions perfectly.For my Pi, however, I get through the first 3, but even though the Pi says that pairing is successful, the controller continues to flash as though it has not been paired. On Batocera, this is particularly egregious because it will fill the screen with connected/disconnected messages, constantly going back and forth. And since the controller hasn't exited pairing mode, it shuts down a short time later.I've tried this on both Batocera and Pi OS with the same results. Both images and everything on them are 100% up-to-date. The Pi is getting a full 25W power supply. I am aware of the existence of adapter dongles, but I have seen people use bluetooth controllers with a Pi 5 without a dongle, no issues. I have searched around to no avail to find a dongle-less solution that isn't just sudo apt update.Any help would be greatly appreciated :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[FS][US-TX][DFW] Unifi switches and access pointsUS-16-XG, US-16-150W, US-24-POE, UAP-AC-Pro, UAP-AC-Lite, UAP-AC-LR, US-48, 10G DAC cables</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1j6qsdv/fsustxdfw_unifi_switches_and_access_pointsus16xg/</link><author>/u/rmtronix</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 20:57:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab Sales</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have the following Ubiquiti gear for sale.

A couple of times a week, I review the note and move the bullet points to their appropriate place in my vault.

We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>People with powerful or enterprise grade hardware in their home lab, what are you running that consumes so many resources?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1j6myd7/people_with_powerful_or_enterprise_grade_hardware/</link><author>/u/LinkDude80</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:05:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Homelab</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After three years of home lab on a single mini-PC (Proxmox, Plex, ADS-B, Paperless, Home Assistant, etc) I’m just now running into enough resource constraints to deploy a second node.

After hundreds of hours over months of searching I finally settled on around 80 opensource apps. What I realized though was that almost all the apps I went with were found through Reddit posts, google searches, or just random sources across the web.All the GitHub Awesome Lists I went through didn't even include a lot of the "best" and most popular OSS projects out there and were instead filled with smaller projects - a lot of which were abandoned.

It's initially available on Pixel devices running Android 15 but will be expanded to "all sufficiently robust Android phones" when Android 16 arrives later this year," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: Today, Linux is only available on the latest Pixel devices running Android 15. When Android 16 arrives later this year, it's expected that all sufficiently robust Android phones will be able to run Linux. Besides a Linux terminal, beta tests have already shown that you should be able to run desktop Linux programs from your phone -- games like Doom, for example. The Linux Terminal runs on top of a Debian Linux virtual machine. This enables you to access a shell interface directly on your Android device. And that just scratches the surface of Google's Linux Terminal. It's actually a do-it-all app that enables you to download, configure, and run Debian. Underneath Terminal runs the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). These are the APIs that enable Android devices to run other operating systems.
 
To try the Linux Terminal app, you must activate Developer Mode by navigating to Settings - About Phone and tapping the build number seven times. I guess Google wants to make sure you want to do this. Once Developer Mode is enabled, the app can be activated via Settings - System - Developer options - Linux development environment. The initial setup may take a while because it needs to download Debian. Typically this is a 500MB download. Once in place, it allows you to adjust disk space allocation, set port controls for network communication, and recover the virtual machine's storage partition. However, it currently lacks support for graphical user interface (GUI) applications. For that, we'll need to wait for Android 16.
 
According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, 'Google wants to turn Android into a proper desktop operating system, and in order to do that, it has to make it work better with traditional PC input methods and display options. Therefore, Google is now testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The DOJ still wants Google to sell off Chrome</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/</link><author>hydrolox</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:57:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The proposal, filed Friday afternoon, says that Google must “promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary to successfully complete the divestiture, to a buyer approved by the Plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to terms that the Court and Plaintiffs approve.” It also would require Google to stop paying partners for preferential treatment of its search engine.The DOJ also demands that Google provide prior notification of any new joint venture, collaboration, or partnership with any company that competes with Google in search or in search text ads. However, the company no longer has to divest its artificial intelligence investments, which was part of an initial set of recommendations issued by the plaintiffs last November. The company would still be required to give prior notification of future AI investments.“Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,” the DOJ statement accompanying the filing claims. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins.”The DOJ formally brought its case against Google back in 2020, the most significant tech antitrust case since the DOJ’s years-long battle against Microsoft in the 1990s. The lawsuit alleged that Google has used anticompetitive tactics to protect its search dominance and forge contracts that ensure it’s the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones. Because of its hold on search, the lawsuit claimed, Google can adjust the auction system through which it sells ads and increase prices for advertisers, and rake in more revenue from that.Google has argued that its overwhelming success in search—it has a nearly 90 percent share in the US market—stems from the company offering the best search technology. It also says consumers are easily able to change their default search engine, and that Google does face competition from Microsoft and others.“DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security,” said Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels in an emailed statement.Much of the ruling centered on the contracts Google has with device makers and browser partners, which use Google as their default search technology. According to Mehta’s ruling, around 70 percent of search queries in the US happen through portals in which Google is the default search engine. Google then shares revenues with those partners, paying out billions of dollars to them, which disincentivizes smaller search rivals who can’t compete with those contracts, Mehta said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Honest AI</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1j6gj0m/honest_ai/</link><author>/u/Fabulous_Bluebird931</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:52:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpt/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - ChatGPT</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discworld Rules</title><link>https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/discworld-rules</link><author>jger15</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:48:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chiang’s LawThis is no way for a high-agency technological species to live, and thankfully it doesn’t have to be.hyperstitional theory-fictionsNo, you have to tell different sorts of stories altogether.as an allegory for technology and society, The rest of humanity, thankfully, has more imaginative and generative models of reality to draw on. You just have to learn to look past the wizards, dragons, elves, and such. There is even a “Science of Discworld” meta-series to help with that.The irony is not subtle. It’s in-your-face. For instance, the core world-building premise is that of a literal “flat earth” disc-shaped planet, resting on the back of four elephants that stand on the back of a giant turtle swimming through space. But this parody of the cosmologies of antiquity is put through its paces with deadpan faux-scientific earnestness. There’s an entire novel about how there was once a fifth elephant, whose fossilized remains are the basis of the fossil fuel industry of Discworld.And it only gets sillier from there.I have a rule-of-thumb: The more seriously you take Discworld, the smarter you get about Roundworld.The silliness is a feature, not a bug. Our universe is a vast, crazy place, and we haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of the endless weirdness it harbors. As Douglas Adams noted, “If life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.” Discworld is about curing yourself of the allure of a “sense of proportion.” There is no surer of way of becoming detached from reality and addicted to some notion of manufactured normalcy.Revealingly, Roundworld isn’t even modeled in the Middle Earth cosmology, except via vaguely racist and lazy allusions (In Middle Earth, I’m presumably one of those turbaned men-from-the-east riding an Oliphaunt and uncritically allied with Sauron). If you double down on the LOTR brainrot, and add things like Ayn Rand and Rene Girard to the soup, you get a profoundly stupid vision of the world that it takes real genius to buy into. Which is what, as it happens, a lot of real geniuses (and I don’t mean this snarkily — Peter Thiel is a legit genius who happens to have bought into a really stupid vision of the world) have in fact done as of 2025, as they try to meme a revanchist Great Power world back into existence.I’ve thought about this a lot in the last few months, and I’ve concluded the whole program is in fact exactly as stupid as it sounds, and will fail in profoundly stupid ways, doing a lot of irreversible damage (Brexit was a small scale model of what’s in store for us here in the US). But to some extent I’ve made my peace with what’s coming, and have no desire to convince you that this is where things are headed. If you’ve bought into that, have fun being miserable in Middle Earth.Instead, I want to sketch out for you how you can truly learn to think in pluralist there-are-many-alternatives ways.The place to start is with the rules of Discworld.from WikipediaPeople who think they are Special and Chosen are dangerous and bad for the world.Wikipedia entrycarrier-bagDiscworld is essentially a kind place though, so the antagonists are usually just contained and neutralized, and sometimes even redeemed. They’re not vengefully made an example of by protagonists. That’s a Chosen One move. Discworlders are kinder, even if it costs them. That’s a point we’ll say more about.The Rincewind stories are one of four major sequences in the Discworld universe. These are:Sam VimesDeathI like this as acerbic commentary on the longevity fetish and Eternalism of the Tech Right. I have no issues with individuals simply making an extreme sport of literally trying to live as long as possible. Bryan Johnson is a friend and occasional client of mine, and Vitalik Buterin, whom I have interactions with through my protocols work, is also a longevity maven. At more regular-people level, friends of this newsletter like Sarah Constantin are into longevity. thar be ossified Asimovian spacer worldsas part of a Chosen One script I prefer a world run by ordinary mortals who have embraced both their ordinariness and mortality.While most core Discworld characters are either mediocre anti-heroes or parodied Chosen One antagonists, there is a big supporting cast of colorful characters who are neither, but not NPCs either. be at the mercy of the gods There is also an array of occasional antagonists who periodically show up with grand Thielean “determinate optimism” type plans, convinced they know better than average shmucks, and threatening the freedom of Discworld for its own good. These last named are perhaps the closest thing Discworld has to unredeemed and unredeemable villains. Discworld wiki[Elves] are not native to the Disc, but come from a "parasite universe", sometimes called Fairyland. This pocket dimension can latch onto different universes at certain times… …Elves have no proper imagination or real emotions, and therefore such things fascinate them. Because they cannot create they steal musicians and artists. Because they cannot have children (although they are capable of breeding with humans, resulting in offspring with superficially elvish characteristics - skinny, pointy ears, a tendency to giggle and burn easily in the sun - but fundamentally human traits i.e. empathy) they steal children from the Disc to be their toys. Because they cannot feel empathy they enjoy the suffering of others. Even if an elf is, for reasons of its own, trying to be nice, its lack of understanding of humans mean there's always something "off" about it.Mostly they get away with this, due to the illusion-creating glamour they cast. While elves are, as mentioned above, not musical, elfsong is perceived as beautiful by humans, and is highly hypnotic. Elves are generally seen as innately beautiful and stylish, but this is just another aspect of the glamour. Some of them are only vaguely humanoid.At one point, the elves migrate to Roundworld and cause havoc there, by killing the narrative vigor of history with their empty and superficial illusions, until Discworlders save the day. I like to pretend this actually happened.Everything satirized and parodied in Discworld, all the ironically deployed tropes of fantasy, are accounted for as the workings of narrativium. That means in-world, all the effects of narrativium are made fun of, but not treated as existential threats. Within the meta-story of Discworld, narrativium adds some of the coherence and discipline that the Auditors of Reality yearn for, but not in a deadening, joyless way. Narrativium is life-affirming narrative irony embodied and embraced.The essential property of Narrativium is that it ensures that the history of Discworld will unfold in satisfying ways that make it a good story. This property is most on display in the fifth major sequence of novels in the map: the Industrial Revolution sequence, which feature one of the most interesting characters, Moist Von Lipwig, who is Vetinari’s fixer, nudging technological progress along.The details of these developments usually feature absurd (and absurdly entertaining) twists on the corresponding Roundworld historical events, while largely staying true to the logic of Roundworld history. For example, film technology on Discworld relies on some faux-science built around small goblins who sit in the cameras painting really fast (magical, but in an inconsequential way).And it’s all very satisfying, in ways the corresponding histories on Roundworld are not. The story also feels a lot more forcefully inevitable and necessary, but not in a restrictive or totalizing way. It is intensified rather than revisionist Roundworld history. That’s what makes narrativium good to have around.This process is one of generative discovery and continuously improvised contingency. The rule that governs this evolutionary process on Discworld, in Pratchett’s own words, is “Our minds make stories, and stories make our minds.”This is the Pratchett version of “hyperstitional theory fiction” which applies with much greater force in Discworld, such that far more consequential things can be memed into existence. In the most extreme case, as we’ve seen, the gods of Discworld themselves are memed into existence by belief, like over-powered versions of the subjects of Roundworld cults of personality. Roundworld religions, thankfully, don’t have this kind of power to create Roundworld gods of equal substance, since unlike the retiring and lazy Discworld gods, we tend to imagine very interventionist and opinionated gods for ourselves.as part of an extended seriesnarratives tell archetypes how to evolve, archetypes tell narratives how to curve.Roundworld, sadly, does not have more than trace quantities of narrativium, which is why Roundworld histories are often so unsatisfying and so easily fall prey to Discworld elves, or humans possessed by them.what does Discworld want?The sentiment behind the aspiration is perhaps a mark of British culture at its best. The high conceit of Discworld is that the infinite game always prevails and cannot truly be derailed by even by the most powerful forces. The mediocre efforts of ordinary characters powered by narrativium is enough to keep the infinite game going.always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. The history of Roundworld in recent centuries has, at least empirically, exhibited such tendencies, but unlike the denizens of Discworld, we cannot trust in that being the intrinsic nature of our world. Certainly those currently in power are trying to prove it isn’t.greater generativity and complexity and more alternatives.Or to put it another way, Discworld has an astounding, unbreakable resistance to Chosen Ones at any scale except the scale of the world itself. Discworld is powered by the anthropic principle on steroids. It keeps discovering new ways in which its entire reality is special.This is one reason Discworld can afford to be such a kind world. As a world that is intrinsically pre-disposed to reject totalizing narratives and protect multiple possibilities in an ever-expanding garden of forking paths, reality is on the side of pluralism and against totalizing conceits.This is why, on Discworld, even the weakest, most mediocre protagonists, when going up against a powerful Chosen One who wants to capture and enslave reality, can afford to be gracious. Even when they are at the lowest, and cowering before a Chosen One who thinks he has won. Because thanks to the narrativium levels in the environment, the protagonists know they will win, and need never despair. The Discworld protagonist seems to know that though they must always scramble comically and improvise energetically to save it from the monstrous Chosen One of the Week, the arc of their moral universe bends in their favor. Discworld is a world that knows what it wants, and how to get it. With some nudging along by Vetinari, Death, and Time Monks, and a lot of reluctant anti-heroic adventuring by the likes of Rincewind, Vimes, Granny Weatherwax, and Moist von Lipwig. Narrativium helps those who help themselves. Unlike Discworld, our own Roundworld has no such specific disposition. The ideas that the arc of moral history on Roundworld bends towards justice, or that “reality” has a well-known liberal bias (a comforting premise of the late-lamented hyperstitional theory fiction of traditional American politics known as “normalcy”) that are popular with us are no more than thin, wishful fictions. Probably planted in our heads by the Discworld elves.Roundworld does not want anything in particular, and no future is necessary. As Discworld scientists have discovered on their trips here, life and civilization have evolved and been destroyed multiple times on Roundworld, in a meaningless process of fragile evolution.Because kindness is worth it for its own sake, even if Roundworld lacks the narrativium leverage to turn it into a world-protecting force.The idea that there are many alternatives is the second most politically loaded one I’ve ever put out, after the idea that with the right technological scaffolding, a proper reckoning with history is in fact possible and desirable, and not necessarily an exercise in bad-faith book-keeping of resentments and grievances. BloodcoinCivilizational HypercomplexityBut at least we’re exploring many alternatives for the moment and not locking into one. And at least the value of real attempts to reckon with history, of the sort I gesture at in the Bloodcoin talk, is becoming crystal clear, given the barrage of wild and transparently motivated confabulations we are now enduring. a noteIf you want peace, prepare for war. If you want war, prepare for peace.If you want the benefits of war without the costs of peace, lie through your teeth about everythingVetinari, incidentally, did not believe the popular first epigram; he thought the truth was more banal — If you want peace, prepare for peace, if you want war, prepare for war. But I think he would agree with my second thought. Whatever the causal pattern linking war and peace, it is clear that those possessed by elves (or Auditors of Reality) lie through their teeth about everything to justify doing whatever they please, as Chosen Ones.Should you live by Discworld rules of kindness and grace, when all that might get you is contempt and destruction? Or should you tell yourself stories that make your mind of sterner stuff? The Culture is a galactic-scale post-scarcity anarcho-capitalist mongrel utopia under the benevolent protection of superintelligent spaceships. The closest fully realized fictional universe to that meme about fully automated luxury gay space communism.The Culture’s AIs and drones have no compunctions about killing and destruction — this is no gentle Three Laws of Robotics Asimovian universe. In fact, the series opens in the aftermath of a bloody war between the Culture and a peer civilization.In the Culture, what is a natural property of reality in Discworld is enforced with extreme prejudice and violence. The entirety of the Culture is like an Assassin’s Guild, with the agents and minds of Special Circumstances acting collectively like a much more forceful Vetinari. While life inside the Culture is something like a high-abundance version of an Ursula Le Guin style peaceful anarchy, its actions in foreign space resemble those of the CIA and KGB at the height of the Cold War, rolled into one. Fomenting revolutions, deposing leaders, assassinations — the whole shebang.Should we play by Discworld Rules or Culture Rules in the coming years? Should we try to become strong before choosing to be kind, or should we choose kindness whether or not we happen to be strong or weak at any given time?I don’t know, but I like that I have at least two good alternatives to ponder. That is the power of not being tied to one narrative with no alternatives being admissible. I may never end up choosing, but I think either set of rules would be better than LOTR rules.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Other e-readers besides Kindle</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1j6g5u6/other_ereaders_besides_kindle/</link><author>/u/featheryHope</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:30:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Obsidian</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been reading mostly on Kindle Android and using the Kindle sync community plugin to pull in notes & highlights.

In short terms, every time you create a thing while writing you "open a bracket". It could be a place, an item, an historical event. This opened bracket should get eventually a closing one. The place ends being the local of the final battle, the item ends being something that it needed to diffuse the bomb, etc. I want to keep track of my brackets. Can you thing of ways to do that? I first thought of using a front matter content. "Date of creation" and "date of conclusion" but I don't know it's the best way of doing such thing.Can you think of alternatives?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Volkswagen reintroducing physical controls for vital functions</title><link>https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-reintroducing-physical-controls-vital-functions</link><author>zfg</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 07:25:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[All future Volkswagen models will feature physical controls for the most important functions, design chief Andreas Mindt has said.The German firm has been criticised over the past few years for moving many of the vital controls in its cars from physical buttons and dials to the infotainment touchscreen. Volkswagen also introduced haptic ‘sliders’ below the touchscreen for the heating and volume and it started using haptic panels instead of buttons for controls mounted on the steering wheel.More recently, the firm has reintroduced physical steering wheel buttons and Mindt said it is committed to reintroducing physical buttons, starting with the production version of the ID 2all concept that will arrive next year.“From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions – the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light – below the screen,” said Mindt. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this.“We will never, ever make this mistake any more. On the steering wheel, we will have physical buttons. No guessing any more. There's feedback, it's real, and people love this. Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.”Mindt said VW will continue to offer cars with touchscreens, in part due to new legal requirements that, as in the US, will require all cars to feature a reversing camera. “There are a lot of functions you have to deliver in certain areas, so the screen will be big and you will find a lot of HMI [human-machine interface] contents in the depths of the system,” he added. “But the five main things will always be on the first physical layer. That’s very important.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Open-Source DocumentAI with Ollama</title><link>https://rlama.dev/</link><author>Dontizi</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 02:12:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Open-source project.

The risk was found to be overhyped – a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale.Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.The rate of false positives, instances when the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to Surveillance</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/first-porn-now-skin-cream-age-verification-bills-are-out-control</link><author>hn_acker</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 18:34:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to SurveillanceThe Problem with Age Verification: No Solution Is Safeno method of age verification is both privacy-protective and entirely accurate]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
