They came together to call for equal opportunities, gender and sexual self-determination, as well as an end to gender-based violence. Berlin is one of only two German states that treat International Women's Day as an official public holiday.

Poland also hosted demonstrations for International Women's Day. Activists opened the country's first center where women can have abortions using pills. It's located directly opposite the parliament building. The predominantly Catholic country has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, but the frontrunner in this year's presidential election aims to change that.

Trudeau announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen. Election laws mandate a vote before October but one is expected sooner. Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are cancelling trips south and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in Parliamentary elections that are expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States. Carney navigated crises when he was the head of Canada’s central bank and when he became the first non-citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.Carney is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever of 1%, working with bankers to sustain lending through the crisis and, critically, letting the public know rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing.And it wasn’t just that he had good policies — he sold them to the public in a way everyone could understand. He was the first central banker to commit to keep them at a historic low for a definite time, a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow.Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January.The other top Liberal leadership candidate is former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.Three points turned the leadership race into a runaway for Carney. Freeland had a long association with the unpopular Trudeau. Carney worked hard to gather support from Liberal members of Parliament members. And Trump’s tariff fixation was also pivotal, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. “Liberal backbenchers feared losing their seats and knew that Carney was more electable as their leader than Freeland,” Wiseman said. The Liberal Party members will pick a new leader in a secret vote by about 140,000 members that will be announced on Sunday. The new leader is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote this month. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Carney’s calm demeanor and outstanding resume make him a reassuring figure to many Canadians at a time when Trump is going after their country’s economy and sovereignty.Béland said that style and profile stands in strong contrast to the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre, whom he called a true career politician who has embraced a populist rhetoric not unlike Trump's. Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who says he will to put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster and cut taxes. “That works with his base but that is not welcomed by other Canadians, especially considering what the U.S. president is now saying about, and doing to, their country,” Béland said. Poilievre urged Trump on Friday stop the attacks on Canada and “the monthly melodrama that is hurting our economies on both side of the border."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intensified Russian attacks: How important is it for Putin to claim victory in Kursk? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu-9tqMFPKY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Eu-9tqMFPKY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 21:33:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More than a dozen people have been killed in Ukraine, during heavy overnight attacks by Russia.

Fire engulfed a five-storey apartment building. As emergency services arrived, Russia launched another strike on the same area. Eleven civilians were killed, with five children among the 30 injured.Writing on social media, Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the “vile and inhuman intimidation tactic often used by the Russians”. Three people also died and seven injured in a drone attack in the city of Bohodukhiv, in the Kharkiv region.Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukrainian cities has intensified after a torrid week in which Trump has pulled the plug on intelligence sharing with Ukraine and halted the supply of US weapons.These hostile moves mean the alarm system that warns Ukrainian civilians of incoming enemy missiles is less effective. Asked if Putin was taking advantage of US aid pauses, Trump on Friday acknowledged Ukraine was experiencing a “tremendous pounding”.He suggested, however, that “anyone in Putin’s position” would do the same. Before a meeting on Tuesday between US and Ukrainian representatives in Saudi Arabia, Trump said he was “finding it easier” to deal with Moscow than with Kyiv.European leaders suggested the US president was complicit in the latest devastation.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said there had been “another tragic night in Ukraine”, with “more bombs, more aggression and more victims”. Without mentioning Trump directly, he said: “This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians.”The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the “relentless” Russian missiles demonstrated that Putin had no interest in peace. “We must step up our military support. Otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price,” she said.Zelenskyy has been seeking to repair relations with Trump after their acrimonious White House meeting last month. Ukraine’s president has sketched out a peace plan – beginning with a truce on land and sea – and said he is ready to sign a favourable minerals deal with the US.So far, however, Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine while making no demands of Russia. Zelenskyy said Saturday’s strike showed Moscow’s objectives had not changed. He called for an increase in sanctions against Russia to “collapse” its war economy.Russia’s latest strike transformed the centre of Dobropillia into a sprawling ruin. The apartment block was a gutted mess. There were burnt-out cars and vans and smouldering debris. Rescuers swept up glass and twisted pieces of metal. Video from the strike showed a terrifying explosion.Irina Kostenko, 59, spent the night cowering in her hallway with her husband. When she left the apartment building on Saturday, she saw a neighbour “lying dead on the ground, covered with a blanket”. “It was shocking, I don’t have the words to describe it,” she told the AFP news agency.Meanwhile, Russia has exploited the US intelligence and weapons freeze to launch a series of bold attacks. North Korean and Russian troops have broken through Ukraine’s defences in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian units have for seven months occupied a parcel of territory.There were unconfirmed reports on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had managed to stabilise the situation and avoid encirclement, at least for now. A hundred Russian soldiers crept through a gas pipeline in a raid on the Kyiv-held Russian town of Sudzha, Ukrainskaya Pravda newspaper reported.Ukraine’s hold on territory in Kursk is increasingly precarious. Soldiers told the Observer two supply roads with the Ukrainian city of Sumy were open, but came under constant attack from Russian drones and artillery.Serhiy Sternenko, a prominent Ukrainian activist, described the logistics situation there as “rapidly deteriorating and already critical”. “Logistics routes to Sudzha are under full enemy fire control,” he posted on X.According to Kremlin bloggers, Russian combat groups advanced several kilometres across the border into Ukraine’s Sumy region. Russia also said it had retaken three villages in neighbouring Kharkiv oblast.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Massive rallies in South Korea as Seoul divided over Yoon&apos;s impeachment</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9SnmNXvMA</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Oy9SnmNXvMA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:36:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Massive rallies in support and against South Korea's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol divided the heart of the country's capital on Saturday.

Sources told Expressen that this will affect several exercises currently in the "drawing board" phase that will be held in Sweden.  Since his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to pivot American security priorities away from Europe and focus on China and the Indo-Pacific Region. He shocked allies with recent moves including ending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, excluding European allies from peace talks held with Russia in Saudia Arabia, and has repeatedly pressuring NATO allies to increase their defense spending. In response, a rattled Europe has begun preparing itself for a world order in which the United States cannot be relied on. EU member states agreed to free up what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>South Korea&apos;s impeached President Yoon freed from prison but faces ongoing trials | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5wNOHNODPY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J5wNOHNODPY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:16:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[South Korea's impeached president has been released from prison.

A score of 100 percent would mean full equality with men. African women are a long way from that.
 
In 2023, African women scored just over 50 percent — so only halfway to complete gender equality across economic, social, and public leadership areas. It is a sobering statistic that shows only a slight improvement from 48.6 percent in 2019.
 
But there is some light in the darkness: Namibia, the highest-ranking country in the continent, scores 88 percent. The report calls it 'the African champion of gender equality'. Tiny Lesotho, a gender equality giant, scores 82 percent. Its constitution guarantees equal pay for women and men. And Rwanda scores almost 80 percent — The report says it has a 'strong political will for gender equality'. That might have something to do with the fact that 61 percent of Rwanda's elected representatives are women.
 
But elsewhere, the landscape is less promising. In regard to the extent to which men and women participate equally in decision-making in politics, government and business, things have improved slightly but that rate is so slow, it would take until 2063 for African women to achieve full equality.

Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) software is leading the car industry’s push to automation.Mr Musk is banking on autonomous driving being the next source of growth as Tesla’s sales decline amid a political backlash over his support for Donald Trump.The Tesla chief, who has frequently clashed with Sir Keir Starmer in recent months, has said that autonomy will be the “main driver” of value. Tesla shares have fallen by almost a third this year as it faces sales declines in many of its key markets.Tesla’s top lobbyist in Europe left the company in October, hitting out at the slow process that means the technology – introduced in the US in 2020 – may not make it to Europe until 2028.Minutes from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) – the body that decides new safety rules for vehicles – show that DfT officials raised concerns about plans to approve wide-ranging driver assistance systems.As originally drafted, the plans would have allowed vehicles to make manoeuvres such as lane changes, junction turns and stopping and starting at traffic lights while motorists had their hands off the wheel.However, the changes have now been watered down to restrict the systems to “highway” moves such as lane switching and to require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel.In September, UK officials proposed the restrictions, saying: “Introducing system-initiated manoeuvres is a significant step which entails a degree of unknown.“Whilst [a driver assistance system] may help in reducing collisions, it may also introduce new safety risks.”They said the technology should instead be introduced “in phases”.In January, officials in the UK, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands put out a request for further evidence on the safety of driver assistance systems, saying: “The technological advancements in these systems are promising, but there remain concerns about their impact on driver behaviour, situational awareness and overall safety.”The changes mean that only a basic version of systems such as Tesla’s FSD are likely to be deployed in the UK and Europe over the next year.Marc Van Impe, Tesla’s former head of safety policy, who had overseen discussions on the changes, left the company for Mr Musk’s SpaceX in October, saying that the slow process “impacts Europe’s competitiveness”.Tesla has sold “full self-driving capability” as a paid-for upgrade since 2016, and currently charges £6,800 for the feature in Britain, although it has no practical use.The company said last year it hoped to introduce full self-driving features in Europe during the first quarter of 2025, although Mr Musk recently conceded that was unlikely.“Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed,” he told investors in January, saying he was unsure whether Tesla would be able to release the system this year.The company could seek an exemption to the regulations. Drivers of Ford’s Mustang Mach-E are able to take their hands off the wheel on motorways in the UK after the company secured an exemption in 2023.Thousands of drivers in the US are using the FSD system and Mr Musk has said he hopes the cars will be able to drive “unsupervised” this year, a step to launching a robotaxi business.Last year, he unveiled a “cybercab” with no pedals, steering wheel or mirrors which Tesla hopes to start making in 2027.Despite Tesla branding the system as “full self-driving”, driver assistance technologies such as FSD are legally different from self-driving systems, where the liability would fall on the company behind the system, rather than the driver.A DfT spokesman said: “The UK has some of the safest roads in the world. With 88pc of all recorded road accidents currently involving human error, advanced driver assistant technology could play a crucial role in reducing accidents and saving lives.“Road safety is our absolute priority, and that’s why we’re working closely with other countries to ensure these new technologies are safe, while harnessing the potential of autonomous vehicle technology to create jobs, power growth and help us deliver our Plan for Change.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Now, with Trudeau set to step down, those disparities have widened further. Indigenous people, who make up about 5% of Canada's population, account for 34% of Canadians under long-term supervision orders.
 
One of them is Marvin Starblanket, a member of the Mistawasis First Nation who was released from prison two and a half years ago. Correctional Service of Canada rules still govern his life.

Soon after the aerial attacks, Trump said Vladimir Putin was “doing what anybody would do”.Overnight strikes in eastern Ukraine on Saturday killed at least 14 people and wounded dozen more, including five children.Wallace, who was the defence secretary when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, said on Saturday that Trump was diminishing the hope of Ukraine with his actions.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Hope is the most important thing in this type of conflict and, at the moment, Donald Trump is suffocating the hope that Putin can be either fought to a standstill or indeed brought to the table.”He added: “Hope is always the key for both morale and a military campaign. When this started three years ago, I remember gathering the military officials in my then department, and saying on day one, we have to give the Ukrainians hope.“If a Russian truck has a puncture, we need to let people know. If the Russians have a small defeat, we need to let the Ukrainian people know.”Wallace suggested that Ukraine could still win the war if it continued holding off Russian forces. He said: “If Ukraine continues to resist for 18 months, the Russian economy will collapse. Its inflation rate’s at 23%, it’s spending 40% of its money [on defence], it’s finding it incredibly hard to replace its equipment. It can use North Koreans like cannon fodder, but fundamentally, it is not in a good place.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Ukraine is not trying to invade Russia and go all the way to Moscow. Ukraine is trying to defend its sovereignty and its land and there is hope for them. If we were to all step up, either substitute what the Americans have taken away, or indeed show proper European resolve, and in that I include the United Kingdom, that we ain’t going anywhere.”Leaders in Europe have convened in the past week in response to Washington’s change in stance on the war. Keir Starmer said Europe is “at a crossroads in history” and confirmed that the UK and France would lead a “coalition of the willing” to help end the fighting.On Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that “the only imperial power that I see today in Europe is Russia” and called Vladimir Putin “an imperialist who seeks to rewrite history” after the Russian president appeared to compare him to Napoleon Bonaparte.Wallace said: “I’ve seen good leadership from both Keir Starmer and President Macron on this and they should both be congratulated.“What I’m hoping they’re all doing right now behind the scenes is working out what the Americans have switched off, and finding European sources, or even further afield, to replace it.”]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
