"One aspect of that is we need builders and it's part of the reason why earlier today we've brought back the level of the capital gains so that those who take those risks get the rewards."Temporarily waving the one-week employment insurance waiting period.Temporarily allowing businesses to defer corporate income-tax payments and GST and HST remittances.Deploying a new financing facility (the Large Enterprise Economic and National Security Facility).Implementing a "one window" approval process to speed up major projects. Doubling the Indigenous Loan Guarantee to $10 billion, unlocking access to capital for First Nations, Inuit and Métis.Providing more funding for regional development agencies.Removing any mobility restrictions for federally regulated professions. Carney said removing barriers to the free movement of workers, goods and services would increase the size of Canada's economy by $250 billion — equivalent to more than $6,000 for every Canadian.He said he is proud the federal government moved on a number of projects today, such as the Cedar LNG and LNG Canada in B.C. and Port of Churchill in northern Manitoba. "It's high time to build," Carney said. Carney told reporters he would maintain a carbon emissions cap, but that legislation isn't enough to reduce emissions, which is why, he said, he is "focused on action."  "One of the projects, I firmly believe this, of national significance is major investments in carbon capture and storage," he said. "We have the opportunity not just to get emissions down but very importantly to create an entirely new industry that will serve Canadians well but will create exports and jobs and opportunities for many decades."The Conservative Party later alleged Carney was lying about his support of Canada's oil and gas industry."If Carney was sincere, he would immediately commit to the full repeal of the Liberals' C-69, the 'No More Pipelines' Act, C-48, the West Coast Tanker Ban, and the production cap," the party said in a statement. "Instead he doubled down on capping Canadian energy production."Carney's announcement about a national development strategy is also reminiscent of Conservative campaign promises.Just yesterday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que., that he plans to create "shovel-ready zones" with pre-approved construction permits for major resource or energy projects if elected.In 2019, Conservative Andrew Scheer, leader of the Official Opposition at the time, pledged that if elected, his government would build a single coast-to-coast energy corridor to transport natural resources.Most premiers in agreement: FordIn a scrum with reporters following the meeting, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said most premiers agreed about eliminating trade barriers, with he and the federal government intending to clear all exemptions."Nova Scotia is clearing all exemptions. As we move across the country, eventually everyone is going to hop on," he said. "They'll have no choice but to hop on board. Not forced, but there will be so much pressure within their territory or their province."Ford repeated that all options remain on the table, including potentially increasing an energy tax on the U.S. despite Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's opposition to that approach. WATCH | Carney presents national strategy:"Ontario will decide that. No other jurisdiction," he said. "I don't worry about her oil and she doesn't have to worry about my energy."Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and B.C.'s David Eby attended virtually, as did Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey who is in Japan for a trade mission.Ford reiterated that he would work with anyone as long as it's in Ontario's best interest. New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt voiced support for Carney, saying in French that she is "very happy" to have him as prime minister while Canada is under tariff threats. "From what I've seen of Mr. Carney and the conversations we have had, his passion for Canada shines through, his intelligence shines through," she said. She said she has yet to meet with Poilievre and doesn't have a comparison point. Legault wants 'global negotiation'  Shortly after arriving for the meeting, Quebec Premier François Legault told reporters that he wants the next prime minister to ask Trump for a "global" negotiation of a trade agreement rather than one that is piecemeal."Right now, Mr. Trump doesn't respect the agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, especially on steel and aluminum. So it's important we renegotiate all the agreement," he said.He said premiers and the prime minister need to be careful about counter-tariffs and "eventual" counter-tariffs to maximize the negative impact on U.S. businesses but minimize the impact on Canadian ones. The Quebec premier said his province would be "open" to pipeline projects, due to Trump's threats, but there needs to be social acceptability.Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai acknowledged that, with increased focus on the North and the Arctic, it's important to hear the plans of all political parties for the region, especially in light of the rhetoric south of the border.Pillai said he wants to make sure the prime minister is aware that it is a "special moment in time for us" and that his visit to Iqaluit, the first domestic trip of his leadership of Canada, was "important and set a tone.""Other people are focusing on the North and we sure need to do the same," Pillai said. "In the first week, personally, I'm very impressed with what I've seen."Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok agreed, saying it was great to see Carney underline "how important the North is and how much incredible of an opportunity we have to provide the country with an opportunity to diversify."Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew emphasized the need for a "solid plan for Canada's economy" because the country is "fighting a trade war on two fronts.""Trump tariffs certainly attract so much attention, but in Manitoba and in Western Canada, the tariffs from the People's Republic of China on canola and pork are having a major impact already," Kinew said.With files from CBC's Olivia Stefanovich, Lisa Mayor, Meagan Fitzpatrick, Kate McKenna, Raffy Boudjikanian]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are Anti-Musk Attacks Affecting Tesla, Elon?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_eCgA1gN5M</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/X_eCgA1gN5M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 23:15:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg's Max Chafkin shares his thoughts on what to make of Tesla's stock down almost 50% from its December peak and various anti-Musk attacks happening & whether or not Elon Musk is able to turn things around.

But I can tell you if we did, we're very well-equipped to handle it," he said.He also rejected reports that his adviser Elon Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China - a rare suggestion that his far-reaching role in the administration will face limits."Elon has businesses in China," he said. "And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that."The president confirmed he would be speaking to China's president Xi Jinping about tariffs. Mr Trump also said there was flexibility on his controversial economic measure.It comes as Mr Trump expressed enthusiasm for possibly becoming a member of the Commonwealth.Sharing an article on his Truth Social network about plans to allegedly make the USA the next associate member, the President wrote: "I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!"'Our allies are calling constantly'The plane's design remains a closely-held secret, but would likely include stealth, advanced sensors, and cutting-edge engines.The initial contract to proceed with production on the jets is worth an estimated $20bn (£15.5bn).Enable CookiesAllow Cookies OnceMr Trump said the jets will be built over several years and "it's something nobody has ever seen before"."Our allies are calling constantly," Trump said, adding foreign sales could be an option. "They want to buy them also."After saying the US would "tone down" the new jets by 10% for any sales to allies, Trump said: "[It] probably makes sense, because someday, maybe they're not our allies."Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the programme as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7tr (£1.01tr) over its lifespan.'I'll pay out of my own pocket'Meanwhile, Mr Trump said he will pay NASA astronauts  overtime pay after their trip to the International Space Station lasted nine months longer than planned.A reporter at the news conference said the pair are not entitled to overtime pay, prompting Mr Trump to say: "If I have to, I'll pay it out of my own pocket."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Youth uprisings in Turkey: What is driving students&apos; outrage over Istanbul mayor&apos;s arrest? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnbe2VdW2FY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cnbe2VdW2FY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:20:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DW's Julia Hahn speaks to protesters on the ground in Istanbul after the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

Airport officials say "some flights" will resume tonight, with full operation beginning Saturday morning. Passengers are being told not to travel to the airport until their airlines give them the green light to do so. Europe's busiest airport was closed on Thursday night by a power outage caused by a fire at an electrical substation. The blaze is being investigated by counter-terror police, but they have said there are no indications of foul play.  The head of British Airways says it will be a major logisitical challenge for airlines to resume their flight schedules, as aircraft and crews may not be in place to fly when Heathrow reopens.

Years of rapid glacier retreat mean many are unlikely to survive the 21st century. With glaciers shrinking, this event is less of a celebration, and more of a reckoning. Glaciers and mountain ice caps store about 70% of global freshwater resources. In recent years, glacier ice has receded at a record rate. The loss ranges from 2% in the Antarctic to almost 40% in Central Europe. 

DW caught up with well-traveled photographer Sean Gallup, whose pictures over the past nine years show the stark transformation in the landscape.

Sounds good to me!" Trump wrote in response to the report. has reached out to the Commonwealth for comment via email Friday afternoon.The Commonwealth is primarily comprised of former British colonies or dependencies, born out of the breakup of the British Empire in the mid-20th century. Joining such a group could be seen as a different tact to Trump's other messages on groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations (U.N.), which he has been skeptical of.According to the king is expected to make the offer to make the U.S. the 57th member of the Commonwealth at a time when America's relationship with the European Union (EU) has been strained over Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia.The offer is being seen as a way to bolster the U.S. and United Kingdom's so-called "special relationship", despite America having famously split from British rule in the 1700s. The two countries have frequently worked together on foreign policy in the 20th and 21st centuries.While joining the Commonwealth would largely be symbolic, as the group does not affect governance of its member nations, the move could be used to help avoid the heightened tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump has promised, according to .Trump has shown his support for the British royal family for many years and visited Buckingham Palace as part of a state visit during his first term in the White House. The idea to join the Commonwealth was first floated during that 2017-2021 term.The king invited Trump back to the U.K. for another visit in a letter hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on his trip to the White House. At the meeting, Trump described King Charles III as "a beautiful man."King Charles III in a statement on Commonwealth Day on March 10: "In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship...The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today."While it's not clear if the U.S. would definitely join the Commonwealth, neighbors Canada are part of the group of nations, and at a time of heightened cross-border tensions, being part of the same collective could help ease matters.Update 3/21/25, 12:56 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why is strengthening Europe crucial? | Berlin Briefing Podcast</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFJZMdn8Po</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YSFJZMdn8Po?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can Germany and France unite to strengthen Western democracies?

But Mexico has fallen behind in its water payments due to drought conditions in the arid north of the country.US farmers and lawmakers complain that the neighboring country has waited until the end of each cycle in the past and has come up short in the latest period.A year ago the last sugar mill in southern Texas shut down, blaming a lack of water deliveries from Mexico.After 18 months of negotiations, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement in November, days after Trump’s election, to improve deliveries.Hailed then by the Biden administration, the understanding calls for Mexico to work with the United States to deliver water in a more timely way, including earlier in each five-year cycle.Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Thursday before the state department announcement that the water issue was “being dealt with” through the two countries’ boundary and water commission.“There’s been less water. That’s part of the problem,” she told reporters.Tijuana, a sprawling city on the border with the US state of California that has become a hub for manufacturing, depends on the Colorado River for about 90% of its water and has suffered waste from creaky infrastructure.The Colorado River, also a major water source for Los Angeles and Las Vegas, has seen its water levels shrink due to drought and heavy agricultural consumption in the south-western United States, with around half of its water going to raise beef and dairy cattle.In southern Texas, farmers have voiced fear for the future of cotton, citrus and other farming products without more regular water deliveries from across the border in Mexico.Brooke Rollins, the US agriculture secretary, on Wednesday announced $280m in relief funds for Rio Grande valley farmers.“Texas farmers are in crisis because of Mexico’s noncompliance,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on X, praising the state department’s water decision.“I will work with the Trump administration to pressure Mexico into complying and to get water to Texas farmers.”The water dispute comes as Trump takes a tough approach to Latin American countries, especially on migration.Trump on returning to office has vowed to end arrivals of undocumented migrants, who largely come from Central America and Venezuela but transit through Mexico.Trump deployed troops to the border and announced painful tariffs on Mexico, although he has since put them on hold until 2 April.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Israel&apos;s high court freezes Netanyahu&apos;s dismissal of Shin Bet chief | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM4vJmapsso</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aM4vJmapsso?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:07:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Israel's Supreme Court has put a temporary halt on the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar.

Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in Bar long ago, while Bar himself had previously hinted he might resign after taking responsibility for intelligence failures over the October 7 Hamas terror attacks.

Prince William asked whether there was still a stigma when it comes to talking about mental health problems in the armed forces. "It's going in the right direction," welfare officer Amy-Jane Hale replied.While touring the facilities, the prince managed to try his hand at pool and table football. That quickly became a game between his team Aston Villa and a supporter of their rivals Birmingham City.On Thursday, hundreds of local Estonians waited in the cold to meet the prince in Tallinn, lining the railings to shake his hand or to take a selfie. He was warmly welcomed to this small, tech-savvy country, which increasingly relies upon its allies.Estonia has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, sharing a border with Russia and having been under Soviet rule in the past. All around the capital there are Ukrainian flags flying alongside the Estonian blue, black and white tricolour.Many Ukrainian families have taken refuge in Estonia. During a visit to a school in Tallinn for Ukrainian child refugees, Prince William praised Ukraine's strength. "The Ukrainian resilience is everywhere," Prince William told the students. "You have a very good spirit, very good souls, it's very important."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gathering at Stonehenge to celebrate the spring equinox | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwmUFI2rdpA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MwmUFI2rdpA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 12:45:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dozens gathered at Stonehenge in southern England to watch the sunrise and celebrate the spring equinox

On his first day back in office, Trump issued an order stating that the government would recognize only two sexes: male and female.A new section has been added under Denmark's visa rules for entry into the United States. It states that when applying for a U.S. visa, there are only two gender options available, male or female.If your passport has the gender designation X, or if you have changed your gender, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises contacting the American embassy before traveling for guidance on how to proceed.The change was made after LGBT+ Denmark contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting an update to the travel advice, per RadioIIII.Meanwhile in Finland, the advisory notes that if the gender on an applicant's passport differs from the gender confirmed at birth, U.S. authorities may deny entry. It's recommended to check the entry requirements with U.S. authorities in advance.Additionally, Finnish passports do not include an "X" gender marker. If a dual citizen holds a passport with an "X" marker, it's advisable to verify entry conditions with U.S. authorities beforehand, according to the new guidance.It comes after Trump also signed an executive order outlining steps to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, a policy currently facing legal challenges.
