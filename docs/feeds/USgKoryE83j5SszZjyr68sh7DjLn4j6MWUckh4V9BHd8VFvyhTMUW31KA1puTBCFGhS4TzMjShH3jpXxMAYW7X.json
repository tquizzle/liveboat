Absolutely loving it so will be buying it when my trial gets closer to running out. </p> <p>Prior to this I used ProxMox and had my HomeAssist running in VM. I’d never played around with containers, it was next on the list to learn on the Mac Mini, but then I got the PowerEdge. </p> <p>I know I need to start my HA setup over as I can’t import a VM backup into a container, and have already got most of my devices connected. But I’ve got stuck on my Sonoff Zigbee USB</p> <p>I’ve found the device ID and some instructions for either CLI or compiling the container with the USB device link, but I can’t see where to make those changes in UNRAID. I’ve tried running the CLI command under the console but it throws back as invalid. </p> <p>This is the guide I was following, is this still valid?</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee-config-docker-access-to-usb-stick/226567\">https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee-config-docker-access-to-usb-stick/226567</a></p> <p>Thanks all.
