Unraid or Linux distro only. I have an unused basic unraid license around, I could also use that, even if it seems overkill.</li> <li>No need for dockers or app on this, just a storage (maybe I would use a RAID1 just for a bit more data security - I know RAID is not a backup, but this is the 3rd backup of my important data i would have)</li> <li>I have some 4TB disks around, so I do not have to buy them.</li> </ul> <p>I thought of a three solutions, but I am open to more of them:</p> <p>1) Buy something like a Ugreen DXP2800, 2 bay prebuilt NAS but where I can install Linux or boot unraid. But it is not cheap (around 300 euros), but it has modern hardware (potentially good even if not needed now), low power consumption.</p> <p>2) Reuse the HP Microserver, but leaving it off if not in use (idle power is around 40/50w, and fan is noisy), and buy a cheap/used Raspberry PI to leave it on 24/7 to have the possibility to wake on lan the HP. Or also something else that just sits there in the network (but securely) and could send the magic packet. In case the storage is needed for my friend use, he can just power the system up using the power button.</p> <p>3) Buy a Raspberry PI/mini pc and a 2bay USB Hard Drive enclosure. But I see different opinions for reliability of these enclosures, and of course more cost as I have to buy everything.</p> <p>What would you suggest?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Abracadibra\"> /u/Abracadibra </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i0br5f/need_opinion_best_solution_for_offsite_backup/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i0br5f/need_opinion_best_solution_for_offsite_backup/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Best Beginner Unraid/Hardware Guide?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i082mg/best_beginner_unraidhardware_guide/","date":1736750391,"author":"/u/Jasonwj322a","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I want to build a Unraid NAS after coming from Synology.
