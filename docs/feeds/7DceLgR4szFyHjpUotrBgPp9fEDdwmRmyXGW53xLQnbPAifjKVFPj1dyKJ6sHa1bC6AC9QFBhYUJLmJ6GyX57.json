He has several old computers laying around as a sort of “homelab” thing. Any idea what he might have wanted that for? I worry he’s going to open his present and have no memory of why he originally wanted this thing. It would be nice if I could give him cool ideas in that moment—but I literally have no idea.</p> <p>Can anyone help? What stuff does a BIOS USB programmer usually gets techy guys excited about? </p> <p>EDIT: He initially added it to his wishlist just to have it with the hope to eventually have a reason to use it and justify its purchase. However, he had not thought of how it could help us reprogram/flash the school provided laptop that had restrictions so that was helpful! He’s still looking forward to any other opportunities, like the other comments, to come up.
