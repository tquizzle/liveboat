CrowdSec is a new product for me, but it seems to work along the lines of pfSense or OpenSense, which I am familiar with. Currently trying to ingest all info I can about CrowdSec.</p> <p>So, I guess lesson learned. Firewalls and protection are priority installs even if it&#39;s a test VPS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wild_Magician_4508\"> /u/Wild_Magician_4508 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hmxok8/update_fail2ban_working_overtime/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hmxok8/update_fail2ban_working_overtime/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"BrickTracker - A self-hosted web app for tracking your LEGO collection, missing pieces, and more!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hmx314/bricktracker_a_selfhosted_web_app_for_tracking/","date":1735244590,"author":"/u/public_fred","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m excited to share BrickTracker, a project born out of frustration with existing LEGO tracking solutions. After reaching 350+ sets in my collection and now helping my son manage his own LEGO journey, I found that Brickset, Rebrickable, BaseBrick, Peeron, and Bricklink all fell short when it came to tracking sets and especially missing pieces across multiple copies of the same set.</p> <h1>Why I Built This</h1> <p>I keep all my sets inventoried in separate containers, and I wanted a simple way to track which sets are complete and which have missing pieces. When you&#39;re managing hundreds of sets and pieces occasionally go missing (as they do!), it becomes really challenging to keep track of everything with existing tools.</p> <h1>What can it do?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Track multiple copies of the same set</strong> - Each set gets a unique ID, so you can track different missing pieces across duplicate sets</li> <li><strong>Manage missing pieces</strong> - Keep track of what&#39;s missing across your entire collection</li> <li><strong>View your complete inventory</strong> - See all parts and minifigures across your sets</li> <li><strong>Smart image handling</strong> - Images are downloaded once and stored locally, so you&#39;re not constantly hitting Rebrickable&#39;s API</li> <li><strong>Instructions management</strong> - Add PDF instructions for easy access</li> <li><strong>Wishlist support</strong> - Keep track of sets you want to add to your collection</li> </ul> <h1>Screenshots</h1> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/koLAhiWe94.png/raw\">Main interface with set overview</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/MeXaYuVI44.png/raw\">Parts inventory</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/YEPEKOsE50.png/raw\">Missing pieces tracker</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/RuWoduFU08.png/raw\">Minifigure collection</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/hACAbArO44.png/raw\">Wishlist</a></li> </ul> <h1>Tech</h1> <p>It&#39;s built with Python3, Flask and SQLite, runs in Docker, and only requires a Rebrickable API key to get started. All the code is available on my <a href=\"https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\">Gitea</a> instance, and setup is pretty straightforward with Docker Compose.</p> <h1>Note</h1> <p>This has been a hobby project that&#39;s grown over time, so don&#39;t expect enterprise-grade code! It&#39;s built to solve real problems I&#39;ve had managing my LEGO collection, and I figured others might find it useful too.</p> <h1>Try it out!</h1> <p>You can find the project here: <a href=\"https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\">https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker</a> If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback and suggestions!</p> <p>Once set up, it runs locally and only calls Rebrickable when adding new sets.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/public_fred\"> /u/public_fred </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hmx314/bricktracker_a_selfhosted_web_app_for_tracking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hmx314/bricktracker_a_selfhosted_web_app_for_tracking/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Immich exposed to the internet?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hmwniw/immich_exposed_to_the_internet/","date":1735243402,"author":"/u/AhmedBarayez","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, i finally decided that i should host it and i absolutely love it!
