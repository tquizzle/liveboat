Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience.

To examine God’s judgment is to probe God’s character and perhaps assess God’s existence. If God does not exist, God’s judgment may expose it.

Our world, with its vast evils, the ‘best possible world’? It seems absurd. Yet some do claim that ultimately our world will be the best possible world, because the sum total of all the good, primarily generated by human free will and divine providence, will overpower all the obvious evils. Perhaps the calculus should include the entire cosmos?\n\nSubscribe to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen: https://shorturl.at/mtJP4\n\nAlvin Carl Plantinga is an American analytic philosopher who works primarily in the fields of philosophy of religion, epistemology, and logic.

He received his Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.\n\nUnleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.\n\n// Abstract\nIndexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.\n\nThe latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications.

Before <em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nDomino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua \"Alex\" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.\n\n// Abstract\nGiven the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.\n\n// Bio\nGuanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training.

The low-hanging use cases have largely been picked off. The next frontier will be AI coworkers who sit alongside knowledge workers, doing work side by side. At the infrastructure level, one of the most important primitives invented by man - the data center, is being fundamentally rethought in this new wave.\n\n// Bio\nAditya Naganath joined Kleiner Perkins’ investment team in 2022 with a focus on artificial intelligence, enterprise software applications, infrastructure and security. Prior to joining Kleiner Perkins, Aditya was a product manager at Google focusing on growth initiatives for the next billion users team. He previously was a technical lead at Palantir Technologies and formerly held software engineering roles at Twitter and Nextdoor, where he was a Kleiner Perkins fellow. Aditya earned a patent during his time at Twitter for a technical analytics product he co-created.\n\nOriginally from Mumbai India, Aditya graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and an MBA from Stanford University. Outside of work, you can find him playing guitar with a hard rock band, competing in chess or on the squash courts, and fostering puppies. He is also an avid poker player.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nFaith's Hymn by Beautiful Chorus: ⁠<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1bDv6grQB5ohVFI8UDGvKK?si=4b00752eaa96413b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">⁠https://open.spotify.com/track/1bDv6grQB5ohVFI8UDGvKK?si=4b00752eaa96413b⁠</a>⁠ Substack: ⁠<a href=\"https://adityanaganath.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">⁠https://adityanaganath.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile⁠</a>⁠<br />With thanks to the High Signal Podcast by Delphina: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/HighSignalPodcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/HighSignalPodcast</a><br />Building the Future of AI in Software Development // Varun Mohan // MLOps Podcast #195 - ⁠<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1DJKq8StuTo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">⁠https://youtu.be/1DJKq8StuTo⁠</a>⁠<br />Do Re MI for Training Metrics: Start at the Beginning // Todd Underwood // AIQCON - ⁠<a href=\"https://youtu.be/DxyOlRdCofo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">⁠https://youtu.be/DxyOlRdCofo</a>\n\n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">@mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Aditya on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-naganath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-naganath/</a></p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/95652552/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-11%2F391388417-44100-2-7174d356c87e7.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"WipEout with Dominic Szablewski","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/12/11/wipeout-with-dominic-szablewski/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wipeout-with-dominic-szablewski","date":1733911214,"author":"SEDaily","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p>WipEout is a futuristic racing game that was originally released in 1995 for the PlayStation.
