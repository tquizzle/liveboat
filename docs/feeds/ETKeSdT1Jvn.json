I also discuss topics like phantom limb pain, recovering from traumatic brain injury and the crucial role inflammation plays in the healing process. \n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes.

I explain how many of the positive effects of exercise on brain function occur through the action of specific neurochemicals that increase alertness.\n\nI also cover how to best time exercise and which specific types of exercise to include in your weekly routine to maximize benefits for your brain. Additionally, I explain how certain types of exercise trigger the release of a hormone from your bones called osteocalcin, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.\n\nThe positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.\n\nFind show notes with articles, resources and more: https://go.hubermanlab.com/MNDX54b\n\nPre-order Andrew's upcoming book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nDavid: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinui.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*More Huberman Lab*\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Merch: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Exercise, Brain Health & Performance; Protocols Book\n00:04:03 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Helix Sleep\n00:06:55 Brain Health, Cardiovascular & Resistance Training\n00:11:51 Exercise & Positive Impact on Brain Performance; Arousal\n00:18:20 Learning & Arousal\n00:23:18 Sponsors: AG1 & David\n00:26:01 Exercise & Acute Learning\n00:29:16 Tool: High-Intensity Training & Cognitive Flexibility; Over-Training\n00:33:32 Long-Term Brain Health; Tool: Exercise “Snacks”, Cognitive Performance\n00:36:57 Exercise, Brain & Body Energy, Adrenaline, Norepinephrine\n00:44:08 Adrenal “Burnout”?; Exercise to Increase Energy, Adrenaline\n00:48:20 Tool: Core, Compound Movements; Mind-Body Connection\n00:53:58 Sponsor: Function\n00:55:45 Bones, Osteocalcin, BDNF & Hippocampus; Tool: Jump Training\n01:01:30 Exercise, Fuel, Multifactorial Pathways; BDNF & Activity\n01:05:06 Lactate, Astrocytes & Brain Function; VEGF & Brain Health\n01:11:17 Tools: Zone 2, High-Intensity Training, Time Under Tension Training\n01:19:54 Sponsor: Maui Nui\n01:21:37 Tools: Time Under Tension; Explosive Jumping, Eccentric Control Training\n01:25:30 Injury & Exercise, Illness\n01:28:09 Sleep; Injury, Sleep-Deprivation & Exercise\n01:33:51 SuperAgers, Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex, Grit & Persistence\n01:42:04 Tool: Embrace Challenges; Deliberate Cold Exposure, Rope Flow\n01:47:39 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Exercise \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/J2oqi41dCNc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How to Achieve Any Goal You Have in 6 Simple Steps","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxJjAuG3qkQ","date":1736157642,"author":"Mel Robbins","unread":true,"content":"Order my new book, The Let Them Theory 👉 https://bit.ly/let-them 👈 It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

For days the Romans were relentlessly stalked through the woods and pounced on by their pursuers. All told, up to 20,000 Romans were killed in the chaos, and only a handful were able to escape.
