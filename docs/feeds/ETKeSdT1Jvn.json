Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience.
