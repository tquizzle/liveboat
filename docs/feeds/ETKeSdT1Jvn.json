Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience. He has a proven track record of leading successful AI projects and building machine learning models from design to production across various domains, which have impacted millions of customers and have significantly improved business metrics, leading to millions of dollars of impact. He is currently an AI Lead at Intuit where he is one of the architects and developers of their Generative AI platform, which is serving Generative AI experiences for more than 100 million customers around the world.\n\nJineet is also a guest lecturer at Stanford University as part of their building LLM Applications class.

This never-enough-ness can lead to an ambient level of self-loathing that can be incredibly destructive. That's where \"radical self-love\" comes in.\n\nOur guest today is Sonya Renee Taylor. She is the author of three books, including The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love. She is the Founder and Radical Executive Officer of The Body is Not An Apology. She has come to this work as a result of her own personal pain, as a Black woman inhabiting a body that she says does not conform to societal norms. \n\nIn this conversation, we talk about defining radical self-love (and why she believes it's our natural state), tools for cultivating radical self-love, and the connection between being OK with yourself and the larger society. \nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/spmRMjwJdBQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // Robert Caulk // #279","url":"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Unleashing-Unconstrained-News-Knowledge-Graphs-to-Combat-Misinformation--Robert-Caulk--279-e2sis0d","date":1734712634,"author":"Demetrios Brinkmann","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<ituneshack><p><em></em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><em>Robert Caulk</em></a> is responsible for directing software development, enabling research, coordinating company projects, quality control, proposing external collaborations, and securing funding.

He received his Ph.D. from Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.\n\nUnleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.\n\n// Abstract\nIndexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.\n\nThe latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications. He is currently overseeing the structuring of hundreds of thousands of news articles per day in order to build the best news retrieval API in the world: https://asknews.app. \n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://emergentmethods.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://emergentmethods.ai</a></p>\n<p>News Retrieval API: <a href=\"https://asknews.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://asknews.app</a>\n \n--------------- ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">@mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Rob on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/</a></p>\n<p>\nTimestamps:\n[00:00] Rob's preferred coffee\n[00:05] Takeaways\n[00:55] Please like, share, leave a review, and subscribe to our MLOps channels!\n[01:00] Join our Local Organizer Carousel!\n[02:15] Knowledge Graphs and ontology\n[07:43] Ontology vs Noun Approach\n[12:46] Ephemeral tools for efficiency\n[17:26] Oracle to PostgreSQL migration\n[22:20] MEM Graph life cycle\n[29:14] Knowledge Graph Investigation Insights\n[33:37] Fine-tuning and distillation of LLMs\n[39:28] DAG workflow and quality control\n[46:23] Crawling nodes with Phi 3 Llama\n[50:05] AI pricing risks and strategies\n[56:14] Data labeling and poisoning\n[58:34] API costs vs News latency\n[1:02:10] Product focus and value\n[1:04:52] Ensuring reliable information\n[1:11:01] Podcast transcripts as News\n[1:13:08] Ontology trade-offs explained\n[1:15:00] Wrap up</p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/96087501/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-20%2F391880580-44100-2-d57545176debf.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"If You're Struggling with Low Self-Esteem, Watch This! | Mel Robbins","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GrJ1bqbSaY","date":1734712200,"author":"Mel Robbins","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Order my new book, The Let Them Theory üëâ https://bit.ly/let-them üëà It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

I explain science-supported protocols to boost alertness and improve attention, including techniques like visual focus and goal accountability. I also discuss how sleep, along with practices such as non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) and naps, support the brain to enhance learning. \n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes.
