Preferably local to NYC, but the gpu and HP bundle will be available for shipping with buyer covering postage with a prepaid label.</p> <p>Faulty Untested Dell Optiplex 7070 bundle ($70, roughly street price of everything minus the keyboard mouse and chassis/mobo/psu based on eBay sold price -30%): - Includes Dell Optiplex 7070 - i5-9500 (non-T, misremembered model from pc listing) (original) - will include both a 8gb 2400 Kingston and 2x4gb 2133 Crucial DDR4 sticks (all non-original, can’t find original stick) - 256gb sata m.2 2230 Sk Hynix (original) - e-waste keyboard and mouse that came with the Optiplex - if no one takes it within about a month or so, I will be ordering atx to dell adapters to test it to make sure that only the psu is dead. The parts I ordered will be added to the price, and the eventual buyer will get to keep them too</p> <p>GTX 1050Ti ($50): - well used as a monitor out for a thinkserver for a bit of time, but generally sat unused since early this year. No external power needed, so great as additional display outs</p> <p>HP bundle ($10): - Flex IO V1 DP card - 6 pin to 3 sata and 1 slimline sata</p> <p>Faulty APC Back-UPS NS 1250 ($5 just to cover transportation, if pickup then free): - This was the ups that killed the psu on the Optiplex, you can hear what sounds like plastic rattling inside when you shake it. - it may have also placed unnecessary strain on one of the lead acid, causing it excessive wear (battery tester reports 70ish% health in about 4 months of use) - there is a video of someone fixing a UPS from this era of APC UPS <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aBDjliSfCB0?si=LcDe6GfHnWKuPS4f\">here</a> - includes the short intermediary connection cable for anyone who wants to take a crack at fixing it - no battery included but if you want to take the 70ish% health battery, I still haven’t taken it to recycling yet</p> <p>Timestamps for everything: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/oa0mg8qmsuke3aiglqyc8/AMsvhyafEeXGF7u9Ug-ZVDM?rlkey=rc3p28udtu63m2qgw7wdv38dt&amp;st=6o7f6qa2&amp;dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/oa0mg8qmsuke3aiglqyc8/AMsvhyafEeXGF7u9Ug-ZVDM?rlkey=rc3p28udtu63m2qgw7wdv38dt&amp;st=6o7f6qa2&amp;dl=0</a></p> <p>Thank you for taking a look at the listing and happy holidays everyone</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Effective_Pitch_2974\"> /u/Effective_Pitch_2974 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1hn5wmv/fsusnyc_faulty_untested_optiplex_7070_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1hn5wmv/fsusnyc_faulty_untested_optiplex_7070_with/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"[FS][US-WI] PSP 3001s, Dell 2-in-1 Laptops, HP Laptops, Dell Optiplex SFFs, Dell Optiplex Minis, HP EliteDesk SFFs, 16GB ECC DDR4 RDIMMs","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1hn4c36/fsuswi_psp_3001s_dell_2in1_laptops_hp_laptops/","date":1735265361,"author":"/u/navywill88","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Reposting some items with a smaller list, and readjusted prices.
