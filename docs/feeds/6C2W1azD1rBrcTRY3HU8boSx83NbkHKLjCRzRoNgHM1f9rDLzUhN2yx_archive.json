Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience. He has a proven track record of leading successful AI projects and building machine learning models from design to production across various domains, which have impacted millions of customers and have significantly improved business metrics, leading to millions of dollars of impact. He is currently an AI Lead at Intuit where he is one of the architects and developers of their Generative AI platform, which is serving Generative AI experiences for more than 100 million customers around the world.\n\nJineet is also a guest lecturer at Stanford University as part of their building LLM Applications class.

Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications.

Before <em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nDomino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua \"Alex\" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.\n\n// Abstract\nGiven the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.\n\n// Bio\nGuanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft.
