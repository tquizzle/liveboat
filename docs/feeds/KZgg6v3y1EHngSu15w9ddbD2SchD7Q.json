They use it to plan their day, decide what to eat, and to decide how to respond to other people&#39;s text messages. However, it&#39;s gotten so bad to the point where she admitted to me that she spent half a day, in bed, talking to ChatGPT about her love horoscope using a &quot;template&quot; she found on Tiktok.</p> <p>The other day, she asked me for advice on whether or not she should give out her personal Instagram to people she will be networking with as part of her job. I told her it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea and gave my reasons for it. Then she goes &quot;You know what, I&#39;ll just ask ChatGPT when I get home later to see if it&#39;s a good idea.&quot; At that moment, I realized she trusted ChatGPT more than me.

However, I think for her it&#39;s gotten to the point where she cannot survive without ChatGPT.</p> <p>Edit: To clarify, I told her that giving out her personal, private instagram to potential clients she might work with is probably not a smart move. She said she felt pressured to do so because she saw others around her doing it. I understand it&#39;s her business whether or not she wants to, but like I said she asked for my advice. If it was a personal IG used for networking or for &quot;connecting&quot; with others, I would have said go for it. I would consider her a pretty private person, which is why I said what I said.

A comprehensive documentation will be added later this week. You can find help as well as contribute ideas in our discord at <a href=\"http://make.md/community\">http://make.md/community</a></p> <p>In addition to 1.0, one of the highly requested feedback was that the flow block and styler should be a standalone plug-in. Soon, these features will be available in a new plug-in called Basics. These will no longer depend on <a href=\"http://make.md\">make.md</a> so you can use those without having to install the organization and personalization features.

At the moment, I add the sources to Paperpile in a &quot;potential sources&quot; folder, then create the note in Obsidian using the Citation plugin with the tag &quot;Potential.&quot; I also add a callout at the top with a link to the original source where I found the potential one. </p> <p>&gt; For example, if I read <em>Breaking the Social Media Prism</em> by Chris Bail and he references Eli Pariser&#39;s <em>Filter Bubble</em> I create an empty note for Pariser&#39;s book with a callout that is \\@bail2020-SocialPrism and the reason why I might want to read it.</p> <p>The goal isn&#39;t to get a never-ending to read list, though.

Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? \n\nIf generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? \n\nIf a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? \n\nToday, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor.

It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.).
