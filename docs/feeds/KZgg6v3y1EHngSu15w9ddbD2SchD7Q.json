Anything left is tracked but not considered for future months.</p> </blockquote> <p>This approach has helped me stay in control of my money without the usual complexity found in financial tools that force you to budget every penny.</p> <p>For years, I relied on spreadsheets to do this, but as things got more complicated (multi-currency accounts, investments, custom rules, etc.), I wanted something more practical and powerful.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried them all, FireflyIII, Actual, Maybe, even paid options like Mobills and I couldn’t find anything that clicked with me — so I built WYGIWYH.</p> <h3>Why WYGIWYH?</h3> <p>The app is based on a few core ideas:</p> <ul> <li>Simplicity – Money management shouldn’t feel like extra work.</li> <li>No budgets – This isn’t a guilt-tracking app. It’s about understanding where your money goes, not bound by strict budget categories.</li> <li>Living month-to-month – Encourages using what you earn now, while protecting savings for future goals. It’s ideal for people who value clarity and flexibility over spreadsheets and overly structured finance apps.</li> </ul> <h3>Features</h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>Multi-currency support</strong>: Track multiple currencies for income, expenses, and savings without jumping through hoops.

Or also something else that just sits there in the network (but securely) and could send the magic packet. In case the storage is needed for my friend use, he can just power the system up using the power button.</p> <p>3) Buy a Raspberry PI/mini pc and a 2bay USB Hard Drive enclosure.

You can see how I rearranged the rack in the third photo before getting it. I had reserved space for it, but then I added the mini cluster.</li> <li><strong>Beelink Sei12 Max x3:</strong> These boxes contain 500 GB and 1 TB NVMe drives with 64 GB of RAM and 2.5 GbE ports.</li> <li><strong>PiKVM V4 mini:</strong> This is connected to the four Beelink boxes via an ezcoo KVM. </li> <li><strong>Synology Disk Station 1821+</strong> I have five 20 TB and three 4 TB drives in the Synology version of RAID 6. I intend to upgrade the 4 TB drives as space becomes necessary. I recently replaced the first five drives, increasing the available storage from 22 TB to 65 TB! This device is performing exceptionally well. It also runs Plex and some backups, including an incremental backup of a shared family Google Drive containing numerous tape and film videos from my mother-in-law’s childhood.</li> <li>The bottom section primarily serves as smart home hubs. <ul> <li>It has an Echo Dot (muted and speaker disabled) for Amazon-only integrations (I can communicate with it using text-to-speech and control a few devices).</li> <li>A Rachio sprinkler timer hub.</li> <li>A Hue Bridge.</li> <li>A Lutron Bridge for light switches.</li> <li>A Lutron Bridge for window shades.

Oracle \"will file their Answer, and we'll start discovery to show how 'JavaScript' is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle.\" Deno's social media posts show a schedule of various court dates that extend through July of 2026, so \"The dispute between Oracle and Deno Land could go on for quite a while,\" reports InfoWorld:\nDeno Land co-founder Ryan Dahl, creator of both the Deno and Node.js runtimes, said a formal answer from Oracle is expected before February 3, unless Oracle extends the deadline again. \"After that, we will begin the process of discovery, which is where the real legal work begins. It will be interesting to see how Oracle argues against our claims &mdash; genericide, fraud on the USPTO, and non-use of the mark.\" \n\nThe legal process begins with a discovery conference by March 5, with discovery closing by September 1, followed by pretrial disclosure from October 16 to December 15. An optional request for an oral hearing is due by July 8, 2026. \n\nOracle took ownership of JavaScript's trademark in 2009 when it purchased Sun Microsystems, InfoWorld notes. \n\nBut \"Oracle does not control (and has never controlled) any aspect of the specification or how the phrase 'JavaScript' can be used by others,\" argues an official petition filed by Deno Land Inc. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:\nToday, millions of companies, universities, academics, and programmers, including Petitioner, use \"JavaScript\" daily without any involvement with Oracle. The phrase \"JavaScript\" does not belong to one corporation. It belongs to the public. JavaScript is the generic name for one of the bedrock languages of modern programming, and, therefore, the Registered Mark must be canceled. \n\nAn open letter to Oracle discussing the genericness of the phrase \"JavaScript,\" published at https://javascript.tm/, was signed by 14,000+ individuals at the time of this Petition to Cancel, including notable figures such as Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and the current editors of the JavaScript specification, Michael Ficarra and Shu-yu Guo. There is broad industry and public consensus that the term \"JavaScript\" is generic. \n\nThe seven-page petition goes into great detail, reports InfoWorld. \"Deno Land also accused Oracle of committing fraud in its trademark renewal efforts in 2019 by submitting screen captures of the website of JavaScript runtime Node.js, even though Node.js was not affiliated with Oracle.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Oracle+Won't+Withdraw+'JavaScript'+Trademark%2C+Says+Deno.++Legal+Skirmish+Continues%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F0323229%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F0323229%2Foracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0323229/oracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"[FS] Portable Monitor Lot","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/1i093ou/fs_portable_monitor_lot/","date":1736754925,"author":"/u/SouthernPieceBarbie","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Monitors Available: (3 left) Raspberry Pi Screen 10.1 Inch Touchscreen Monitor 1024 x 600 $40/each, or All 4 for $150 plus s/h</p> <p>{SOLD}(1) 7 Inch IPS LCD Touch Screen Display Panel 1024×600 $30 plus s/h</p> <p>{SOLD} (2) KYY Portable Monitor 15.6inch 1080P FHD USB-C, HDMI Computer Display HDR IPS &amp; Case Cover $35 each, or both for $60 plus s/h</p> <p>Or All 5 monitors for $175 &amp; plus $22 shipping (usps large flat rate box).</p> <p>Time stamp: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/cDTRbYn\">https://imgur.com/a/cDTRbYn</a></p> <p>KYY are sold.</p> <p>Payments via PayPal Only.

I'm the president and founder of a small non-profit called Reclaim The Records that identifies historical and genealogical materials and data sets held by government agencies, archives, and libraries -- and then returns them to the public domain, for free public use.<p>Back in September 2017, our organization made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) asking for a copy of a database they maintain called \"BIRLS\", which stands for the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem. While it's not exactly an index of every single post-Civil-War veteran of every branch of the US military, it's possibly the closest thing that exists to it.<p>BIRLS is a database that indexes all the known-to-the-VA-in-or-after-the-1970s *<i>veterans' benefits claims files*</i>, also called C-Files or sometimes XC-Files. Older veterans' claims files have been moved to the National Archives (NARA), such as the famous Civil War pension files. But 95% of the later benefits claim files, from the late nineteenth century up to today, are still held at the VA, in their warehouses, and still haven't been sent to NARA.<p>And even if you know these files exist, the VA really doesn't make it easy to get them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) group within the VA only seems to accept FOIA requests for copies of C-Files by fax (!) and also seems to have made up a whole new rule whereby you have to have an actual wet ink signature on your FOIA request, not just a typed letter.<p>Well, seven years and one very successful FOIA lawsuit in SDNY against the VA later, we at Reclaim The Records are very proud to announce the acquisition and first-ever free public release of the BIRLS database, AND that we built a new website to make the data freely and easily searchable AND that we even built a free FOIA-by-FAX-API system (with a signature widget, to get around the dumb new not-FOIA rules!) built into our website's search results, that makes it much, much easier for people to finally get these files out of the VA warehouses and into your mailbox. :-)<p>We also added the ability to do searches through the data for soundalike names, abbreviated names, common nicknames, wildcards, searches by date of birth or death, or ranges of birth and death years, or search by SSN, or by branch(es) of services, or by gender...<p>For a lot more information about our FOIA lawsuit against the VA for the database, including copies of our court papers and the SDNY judge's order:<p><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/reclaimtherecords/the-birls-database-goes-online-with-eighteen-million-us-veteran-records-and-free-foia-by-fax-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mailchi.mp/reclaimtherecords/the-birls-database-goes...</a><p>As for the tech stuff, actually building the website, the search engine, and its FOIAing capability...well, it has been a pretty fun project to build.<p>The BIRLS dataset was eventually provided to us by the VA (several years after we originally asked for it...) as a large zip file which, when decompressed via the command line, yielded the hilarious file name of *<i>Redacted_Full.csv*</i>. I then loaded the cleaned CSV data into a MySQL database, and then used a modified version of the Apache Solr search engine to index the data, so that it could become searchable by soundalike names (using Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching), nicknames (using Solr's synonyms feature), partial names (using wildcards), with dates converted to ISO 8601 format to enable both exact date and date range searches, and various other search criteria.<p>The front-end of the website is built with Nuxt and hosted on Digital Ocean's App Platform, with backups of the FOIA request data on the cloud storage service Wasabi. The fax interface for submitting FOIA requests is powered by the Notifyre API. We use Mailchimp to send e-mail newsletters, and their product Mandrill for programmatic e-mail sending. We use Sentry for error monitoring, Better Stack for server logging, and TinyBird to collect FOIA submission analytics.<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048</a></p>\n<p>Points: 105</p>\n<p># Comments: 63</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"What Dashboard should I use?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1i04u09/what_dashboard_should_i_use/","date":1736738632,"author":"/u/noobntech","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Im on unriad and I want a nice little dashboard where I can see everything going on on my server.

But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want...\" \n\nHe's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as \"a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro.\"\n\nPowered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. \"We're going to make this a mainstream product,\" Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players &mdash; including Intel and AMD &mdash; in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? \n\nLinux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, \"Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work.\" Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.\n \nThe article strays into speculation, when it adds \"maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks....\" \n\n\"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Will+Nvidia+Spark+a+New+Generation+of+Linux+PCs%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F006249%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F006249%2Fwill-nvidia-spark-a-new-generation-of-linux-pcs%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/006249/will-nvidia-spark-a-new-generation-of-linux-pcs?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: Doom (1993) in a PDF","url":"https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf","date":1736729443,"author":"vk6","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>I made a Doom source port that runs within a PDF file.<p>I was inspired by the recent HN post about Tetris in a PDF (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645218\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645218</a>) and I wondered if I could get Doom to run using a similar method.<p>It turns out that old versions of Emscripten can compile C to asm.js code that will happily run inside the limited JS runtime of the PDF engine. I used the doomgeneric (<a href=\"https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric\">https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric</a>) fork of the original Doom source, as that made writing the IO fairly easy. All I had to do was implement a framebuffer and keyboard inputs.<p>Unlike previous interactive PDF demos, the output for DoomPDF is achieved by creating a text field for each row of pixels in the screen, then setting their contents to various ASCII characters.
