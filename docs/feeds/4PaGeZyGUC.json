The name can be roughly translated as \"cold place.\" The film tells the story of three women: the farmer Hanna, the postwoman Maria and the biologist Nelya.\n\nIn the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, the three protagonists must grapple with their social reality - and loneliness. Very few young people live here, but the elderly women are deeply rooted to their village and its surroundings. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.\n\nIn a tiny kitchen, Hanna shares her feelings of loneliness with the filmmakers, who she says remind her of her deceased sons. At the village post office, post woman Maria has neither stamps nor heating, but customers are warmed with liquor and songs. Somewhere in the woods and caves, biologist Nelya looks for the animal droppings that are a treasure to her. The film portrays an unknown place at the heart of Europe, where people make a daily choice - stay or leave?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!\n\nIs humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?\n\nNext, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity‚Äôs urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. What happens to a photon‚Äôs energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe‚Äôs edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck‚Äôs constant would do to the universe. \n\nWas human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity‚Äôs ultimate motivator?\n\nCould alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made \"Matrix\"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?\n\nFinally, we explore humanity‚Äôs potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their \"Matrix\"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Chuck and Gary‚Äôs Burning Questions\n01:43 - Are We Going to Merge with Machine?\n06:41 - Redshifting to Infinity\n07:59 - If You Could Change Physics\n12:28 - Could We Have Gone to the Moon in 1700? \n21:45 - AI & Energy\n24:51 - How We Use Electrons as a Wave\n28:41 - Are The Aliens Trapped in the Matrix?\n33:19 - Does Physics Prevent Us From Living Forever? \n36:07 - Communicating with Aliens\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century.

They‚Äôre concerned by the issue of animal welfare. But a primary motive is the ecological impact of industrial livestock farming.\n\nIndustrial livestock farming is responsible for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It also requires huge amounts of land and water and is thought to be contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. This is why more and more scientists and entrepreneurs are conducting research on alternatives to conventional meat production.\n\nIn California, Joshua Tetrick is working on a method of growing meat in a bioreactor. He multiplies the muscle cells of chickens in huge tanks and cultivates them with plant-based nutrients. The resulting cell pulp is molded into fibrous meat with the help of a plant scaffold. A kilo still costs many hundreds of dollars. But Joshua Tetrick hopes that production can be scaled up to a globally relevant level. After all, with ‚ÄòGood Meat‚Äô he was one of the first two companies in the USA to receive a license for cultured meat.\n\nAt the University of California, Alison Van Eenennaam is trying to make meat production more efficient.  Using the gene editing tool CRISPR she‚Äôs altered the genetic make-up of a cow so that its offspring are exclusively male. This is a great advantage, as male calves grow faster and consume fewer resources than female calves to produce the same amount of meat - thereby reducing the carbon footprint of livestock farming. \n\nFor Pasi Vainikka from ‚ÄòSolar Foods‚Äô in Helsinki, these are all just intermediate steps on the way to a truly sustainable future food: he‚Äôs cultivating a whole new category of food in gigantic fermenters: Bacteria that are fed with CO2 and hydrogen and blended to create a product called ‚ÄòSolein‚Äô. A flavorless, protein-rich basic ingredient that can replace eggs and milk in practically all foods.\n\nScience journalist Ingolf Baur meets some of the researchers and entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to industrial livestock farming around the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the last decade of my career however, I have been focusing much more on experience design - and engaging people and communities away from technology. I have been studying how to engage people and draw them into a community or conversation - curating every detail across multiple touchpoints including what people see, hear, smell, taste‚Äìand above else‚Äìfeel.\n\nExperience design is critical to designing digital experiences and innovative new products. But it can also be used to explore better workplace policies, better experiences for employees, and even shape creative career paths.\n\nTogether, we‚Äôll explore how experience designers are able to explore new ways of addressing the problems their people face.

In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. \n\nDespite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. \n\n2024 had much of the world voting for change.

What is important, and what can go? The better storage options become, the more difficult it is to answer this question.\n\nWe humans like to preserve everything, whether we‚Äôve collected or created it. Be it sourdough starters, books or blood samples. We want to preserve objects, memories and even microorganisms. \n\nKarl de Smedt is the only sourdough librarian in the world. In St. Vith, Belgium, he keeps 144 sourdough starters from all over the globe, some of which are over 100 years old. Through his collection, he preserves the unique wild yeasts and microorganisms that create each sourdough. \n\nThe German National Library in Leipzig and Frankfurt preserves copies of all books, records and media published in or about Germany since 1913. There are 34 million physical media on the shelves. Digitization can solve the space problem, but also has its pitfalls. For example: data has to be constantly copied, as hard disks can become unusable.\n\nProf. Robert Grass from ETH Zurich is developing a particularly promising storage medium: DNA storage. It is extremely powerful, can be stored for over 1,000 years and can always be read. Data is converted into the DNA code and stored as artificial DNA.\n\nBioBank Dresden stores tumor samples, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid for research purposes. Evidence from criminal offenses is stored in the evidence room of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt am Main. This allows crimes to be re-analyzed using modern techniques and solved decades later.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Some of these ‚Äúmosts‚Äù are genuine testaments to human strength, endurance, creativity, and spirit, while others, are not so much.\n\nTo read more about historic 'mosts', go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/whoa-historical-mosts-/melissa-sartore\n\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/8o4PEJ3bxIY?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Christmas songs but its by rappers | Christmas Special | CHILLAF","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLaVxOA6rqU","date":1735137929,"author":"CHILLAF","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"SUB FOR MORE HOLIDAY SPECIALS!!!!!\nclick for more chill! https://linktr.ee/CHILLAF\nTRACKLIST BELOW!!!!\n\nSpectre Kendricks Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lQalWIp6tE\n\nCookin Soul MF DOOM Xmas https://youtu.be/EwzBjBHfDIs?si=Ry6Uv8iIzMVzAETf\n\nCookin Soul West Coast Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yudw589WC1Y\n\nToasty Digital Kanye Xmas https://youtu.be/7aqDawjezsI?si=XgPacYBuFkkm1urH\n\nToasty Digital Cancel Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C8eLL2QDyU\n\nCookin Soul Xmas in the Bay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikLdXPV6tKg\n\nCookin Soul Biggie Xmas https://youtu.be/b61WyPilXDg?si=67RHQwaEiQGvSoVI\n\nCookin Soul Tribe Called Quest Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45ZFjiABLwI\n\nCookin Soul Wutang Xmas https://youtu.be/7WRNpalBzhA?si=xEDM2DyN4B5cYAbC","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tLaVxOA6rqU?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Building a Domain Specific GenAI Chatbot with Serverless ‚Ä¢ Eric Johnson ‚Ä¢ GOTO 2024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxcZaiPsyo","date":1735131643,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttps://gotochgo.com\n\nEric Johnson - Principal Developer Advocate for Serverless at AWS\n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/edjgeek.bsky.social\nhttps://twitter.com/edjgeek\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/singledigit\nhttps://serverlessland.com\n\nLinks\nhttps://github.com/aws-samples/domain-specific-genai-chatbot-with-serverless\n\nABSTRACT\nNavigating the complexities of Generative AI (GenAI) is made simpler with serverless technologies and API-driven approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs).

Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.\n\nSwitching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy.

Workers endure starvation wages, and toxic materials in the jewelry endanger customers' health. This film uncovers the origins and production of these items.\n\nChinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu supply the world with trendy jewelry - chunky chains, sparkling earrings, and gold bracelets. Some 6,000 new lines are added every day to the Shein range alone. But behind the glossy fa√ßade lies a harsh reality. In the factories where these pieces are produced, grueling 60-hour workweeks are the norm, encapsulated in China‚Äôs infamous \"9-9-6‚Äù culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While the jewelry is dirt cheap, the workers bear the cost. The risks aren‚Äôt limited to factory conditions; the products themselves often endanger customers. Testing frequently reveals toxic heavy metals and harmful chemicals. Scientists featured in the film unpack the health implications, shedding light on the hidden dangers of this booming industry.\n\nTwo German family businesses, Bijou Brigitte and the Beeline Group, are making significant sales across Europe. Their sustainability reports offer vague promises and little transparency about supply chains, leaving customers in the dark about where and how their trendy jewelry is produced. The film crew traces the steps of the supply chain all the way to China to find out more.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

More than 30,000 people have been freed from its prisons, but a further 100,000 remain missing. Families are desperately searching for their loved ones - including Hind Gharz al Deen, whose son Hussam is missing.\n\nHussam disappeared eight years ago. Together with her younger son Ahmad, Hind visits hospitals, morgues and the notorious Sednaya prison to look for him. The family is one of thousands in Syria clinging to the hope of finding their loved ones alive. In one hospital, photos of recovered bodies cover a wall. Many of the victims are horribly disfigured - a further reason why the search is agonizing for family members.\n\nFor Ahmad, looking for his older brother in Sednaya prison is particularly distressing. He was imprisoned there himself after being arrested in 2018. The horrors he suffered still haunt him: the brutal conditions and the cruel torture. Ahmad recounts his experiences on December 8th, the day he and his fellow inmates were freed. Hind and Ahmad find no trace of Hussam, but they continue to search.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It only has 3,500 inhabitants, but it‚Äôs a geopolitical heavyweight. A border battalion with 600 elite soldiers makes its military presence felt.\n\nThe two 19-year-old recruits David Bratland and Jesper Bruseth are doing their military service in Kirkenes with the ‚ÄòJegerbataljonen GSV‚Äô. The training program for border fighters, around 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, is tough. In winter, temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius are not uncommon here. Added to that, just a few hours of daylight. During orienteering on skis, the recruits don‚Äôt just hone their physical fitness, but also their ability to take responsibility for their own actions. Their task: to monitor the almost 200-kilometer-long border with Russia and - in the event of war - to defend it. Recently, the soldiers have also received heavy weapons training for anti-aircraft and anti-tank defense.\n\nNorway also demonstrates its claim to power and territory by promoting culture on behalf of the West. While David and Jesper cross the snow-covered expanses of the Norwegian tundra on skis, the Russian-born curator of the Barents Spektakel, Yevgeny Goman, is confronted with completely different challenges a few kilometers away on frozen Lake F√∂rstevatne. The central element of the opening show of the art festival - a giant flying dragon - simply won't take off. But, in the end, the opening show the following evening turns out to be a great spectacle against hopelessness.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
