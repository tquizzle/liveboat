Male circumcision is done for religious, cultural or medical reasons.\n\nIn Africa, the WHO used male circumcision in the fight against AIDS. But more and more doctors say that the harm done by the procedure outweighs any medical benefits, and that this surgery is performed far too often.\nThose affected are increasingly daring to go public, demanding that boys, too, be protected from circumcisions that are not medically necessary. Advocates say their right to physical integrity must be preserved. \nBut few take it as far as Florian. He‚Äôs sure that his circumcision as a child wasn‚Äôt medically necessary. Moreover, his parents were not informed about alternative options. He‚Äôs taking his case to court.\nThe film explores the question of when circumcision actually makes  medical sense, and critically questions the ethics of this millennia-old practice.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #circumcision\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

His shoes were custom made for him by the late Vivienne Westwood, his jacket was by Simon Porte Jacquemus, his necklace, Cartier.\n\nWhen he sat down to play, arguably only one thing seemed to be missing: a shiny, 9-foot grand piano. But Thibaudet, like many great pianists who have graced our office space, understands the vibe of our beloved little concert series. He knows that the point is not to be playing on the largest piano possible. Instead, he delighted in bringing music by Villa-Lobos, Brahms and Ravel to our diminutive ‚Äî but meticulously groomed ‚Äî upright. And the colors and textures he conjured from that trusty box of wood and wire was unforgettable.\n\nThibaudet begins with a firecracker of a piece from the early 20th century ‚Äî two-minutes of effervescence by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Watch the pianist‚Äôs fingers in a blur, stabbing hundreds of notes like a sewing machine. It was an encore favorite of the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Thibaudet explains.    \n\nWhat follows could not be more different. The Intermezzo Op. 118, No. 2, is classic late Brahms, filled with muted, fall afternoon light and whispered inner voices. Thibaudet ends with a tribute to one of his idols, Maurice Ravel, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated far and wide. Turns out that one of the composer‚Äôs biggest hits, the Pavane for a Dead Princess, was not among his own favorites. And the evocative title was merely tacked on as a poetic afterthought. Still, the wide palette of coloring and shading Thibaudet offers is a masterclass in how to make an upright piano sound like a symphony orchestra. \n\nSET LIST\nHeitor Villa-Lobos: ‚ÄúO polichinelo‚Äù (from A prole do beb√™ No. 1)\nJohannes Brahms: Intermezzo in A major, Op. 118, No. 2\nMaurice Ravel: Pavane pour une infante d√©funte\n\nMUSICIANS\nJean-Yves Thibaudet: piano\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Tom Huizenga\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Andie Heuther\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Alant√© Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #jeanyvesthibaudet</article>","contentLength":2472,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/jlv4wrfKl4Y?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sprint Qualifying Highlights | 2025 Chinese Grand Prix","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imMbPxcL8NY","date":1742547074,"author":"FORMULA 1","guid":449,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Catch up on qualifying for our first Sprint of the 2025 season, featuring some big surprises in all three stages.\n\nFor more F1¬Æ videos, visit https://www.Formula1.com\n\nFollow F1¬Æ:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/F1\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Formula1/\nhttps://www.twitter.com/F1\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/formula1\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@f1\n\n#F1</article>","contentLength":335,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/imMbPxcL8NY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why BP Learned to Love Oil Again","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EEzLHVpOYg","date":1742544000,"author":"Bloomberg Originals","guid":14,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Following environmental catastrophe, corporate missteps and plain bad luck, BP lags its peers.

The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom‚Äù.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Ireland‚Äôs housing market has been a problem since the 2008 financial crisis.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>","contentLength":556,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/BBn0RHBCALU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Cloud Native Attitude ‚Ä¢ Anne Currie & Sarah Wells ‚Ä¢ GOTO 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y77wBeYwhfw","date":1742475685,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":348,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub\nhttp://gotopia.tech/bookclub\n\nRead the full transcription of the interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/episodes/365\n\nAnne Currie - Co-Author of \"The Cloud Native Attitude\" &amp; \"Building Green Software\" @anneelizabethcurrie \nSarah Wells - Independent Consultant &amp; Author &amp; Author of \"Enabling Microservice Success\"\n\nRESOURCES\nAnne\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/annecurrie.bsky.social\nhttps://www.strategically.green\n\nSarah\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/sarahjwells.bsky.social\nhttps://www.sarahwells.dev\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/sarahjwells1\n\nLinks\nhttps://youtu.be/Ez8cqoSRVsA\nhttps://youtu.be/0ISWoTtproY\nhttps://youtu.be/zdI126LzaZQ\nhttps://youtu.be/BRFYQstye_U\nhttps://youtu.be/dzvTlhPXvfE\nhttps://youtu.be/as7ALBoNZqY\nhttps://youtu.be/8fi7uSYlOdc\nhttps://youtu.be/esaoQPIIiTo\nhttps://youtu.be/hczM0n_0toY\nhttps://youtu.be/HKS5sKsIkkc\nhttps://youtu.be/2iLx3XBeUBo\nhttps://youtu.be/OIH9pHmM7dY\nhttps://youtu.be/MbaPtzSuQII\nhttps://youtu.be/UUt7SuG3nW4\nhttps://youtu.be/5zY5_iTGIsU\nhttps://youtu.be/pEsqnHEF2wY\nhttps://youtu.be/sKACrX3llJM\nhttps://youtu.be/Nr3i2r-ffnc\nhttps://youtu.be/HGhW0s7SYaM\nhttps://youtu.be/hBxV3Cr0lXY\nhttps://youtu.be/0GpN_vEUGLk\nhttps://youtu.be/A-XPOsu9Ka8\nhttps://youtu.be/GybLDN4Zofs\nhttps://youtu.be/po712VIZZ7M\n\nDESCRIPTION\nSarah Wells and Anne Currie dive into ‚ÄúThe Cloud Native Attitude‚Äù and uncover why it‚Äôs more than just using cloud infrastructure. It‚Äôs about breaking bottlenecks, embracing rapid change, and aligning the entire organization.\n\nAnne reflects on how Kubernetes has risen since the book‚Äôs first edition, but the core principles remain.

He rolled in deep with a host of musicians and singers, some from the D.C. area and all rocking vintage graphic t-shirts featuring artists that have inspired the rapper. Cordae's meticulous approach to music was evident, and the band was on point by the time soundcheck started.\n\nCordae has always shined as a masterful storyteller. On The Crossroads, he graduates from origin and neighborhood tales to the adjustment of newfound fame and fatherhood ‚Äî most of this set comes from that album.
