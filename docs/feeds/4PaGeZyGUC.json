The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.\n\nTo many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. \n\nThe public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn‚Äôt see his family for months so as not to infect them.\n\nWhen the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nBy now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aur√©lie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aur√©lie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.\n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #coronavirus #pandemic \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.\n\nFour women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan‚Äôs hard-won rights. \n\nThe team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #afghanistan #womenrights \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They discuss how productivity isn‚Äôt just about lines of code but is more about focus and minimizing task-switching.\n\nGail also talks about the difficulty of managing the rapid evolution of system architectures, stressing the need for regular restructuring and refactoring to avoid issues like increased coupling and decreased performance. The conversation moves to open-source development, where Gail highlights how using open-source components can create complex, brittle dependencies, and the need for better communication within these ecosystems.\n\nThey wrap up by discussing the evolving role of technical leadership in navigating these challenges.

The blue color scheme, also reflected on her guitar and nail polish, is a nod to the heartache and sadness found across 2024's Am I Okay?\n\nThe self-proclaimed Emo Cowgirl opens her Tiny Desk with \"I'm Not Pretty\" from her 2023 debut Lucky. Backed by pedal steel and sparkling harmonies, she sings about struggles with intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage and peaking in high school. Like all great country music, her songs reveal deeper and universal truths in life's smallest and messiest moments.\n\nBut Moroney's music is as much about resilience as it is grief. For this set, she also includes a version of \"No Caller ID,\" which celebrates the friends who help you move on, as well as \"Tennessee Orange,\" her 2022 breakout hit and ode to young love. She closes with the title cut to Am I Okay? \"In my discography of sad songs,\" she tells the NPR Music office, \"it's proof that a man was once making me happy.\" She quickly adds, \"It's no longer true, but fun while it lasted!\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"I'm Not Pretty\"\n\"No Caller ID\"\n\"Tennessee Orange\"\n\"Am I Okay?\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMegan Moroney: vocals, guitar\nRiley Lowery: guitar, background vocals\nJohn Barker: guitar\nEric Pritchard: drums\nAlex Shernit: bass, background vocals\nJustin Schipper: pedal steel\nAmie Miriello: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Robin Hilton\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #meganmoroney</article>","contentLength":2094,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/jtRXy0mGtTs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"If You're Doing Well, but Your Tired, Listen to This.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YzhuK4qO08","date":1741339803,"author":"Jocko Podcast","guid":409,"unread":true,"content":"<article>From Jocko Underground 137.\nJoin Jocko Underground: https://www.jockounderground.com/subscribe\n\nI'm crushing life, but I'm always tired.

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU‚Äôs border protection agency‚Äôs reputation. But now, it‚Äôs trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.\n\nThe message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? \nThe new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He‚Äôs said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #frontex #humanrights #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

That‚Äôs not new.\n\nSupport our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOn the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump‚Äôs order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges ‚Äî but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it‚Äôs uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it‚Äôs very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today‚Äôs concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They‚Äôre actually not.\n\n00:00 A rule\n2:23 Jus soli\n3:13 Dred Scott\n4:46 The 14th Amendment\n8:02 Wong Kim Ark\n10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nGarrett Epps‚Äôs law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you‚Äôll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1607&amp;context=aulr\n\nThe Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf\n\nSome original documents we use in the piece:\n\nTrump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02007.pdf\n\nThe Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf\n\nThe Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson‚Äôs letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/veto-message-438\n\nCongress‚Äôs debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/congress-39-session-1-part-1.pdf\n\nThe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000/pdf/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000.pdf\n\nThe Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep169/usrep169649/usrep169649.pdf\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.\n\nWith this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.\n\nLearn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:\n‚Ä¢ The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between\n‚Ä¢ How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain\n‚Ä¢ The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture‚Äîand how to best interact with it\n‚Ä¢ How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code\n\n* Book description: ¬© O'Reilly:\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prompt-engineering-for/9781098153427\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:27 Key aspects of Prompt Engineering &amp; its definition\n08:22 Misconceptions about Prompt Engineering\n10:21 Practical applications &amp; tools\n13:43 5 principles of prompting\n26:27 Balancing creativity &amp; specificity in AI models\n32:42 RAG: The power of iterative steps, query planning &amp; routing in AI systems\n42:59 Understanding agentic systems: Beyond prompt-based AI\n51:56 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nJames Phoenix &amp; Mike Taylor ‚Ä¢ Prompt Engineering for Generative AI ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43cFDqO\nPhil Winder ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement Learning ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nKelleher &amp; Tierney ‚Ä¢ Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, G√∂rner &amp; Gillard ‚Ä¢ Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PromptEngineering #Prompting #GenerativeAI #RAG #RetrievalAugmentedGeneration #DAG #DirectAcyclicGraphs #ChatGPT #ReinforcementLearning #DSPyOptimizers #GenAI #AIUseCase #ArtificialIntelligence #ML #DataScience #JamesPhoenix #MikeTaylor #PhilWinder #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
