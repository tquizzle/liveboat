The genre was born in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 1970s when calypso artist Lord Shorty (who later chose the name Ras Shorty I) added traditional Indian percussion instruments and rhythms to calypso music ‚Äî itself a fusion that incorporates elements of African, Venezuelan, French and American music.\n\nA proud Trinidadian, Montano's contribution to soca has earned him awards and recognition since his youth. His career began in earnest when he was 7 years old, and by the time he was 10, he'd shared the stage with Calypsonian pioneers and icons, most notably performing at Madison Square Garden with Mighty Sparrow, Lord Kitchener and The Mighty Shadow.\n\nIndeed, Montano's Tiny Desk Concert was representative of his 40-plus-year career and, to the delight of those in attendance, included some of his biggest hits: \"One More Time,\" \"Famalay,\" \"Like Ah Boss\" and \"Soca Kingdom.\"\n\nGuests who attended Montano's performance came ready to f√™te! They jumped, they wined and they waved the flags of their respective Caribbean islands up high, singing along word for word. Being a Barbados-born, Saint Lucian-bred gyal, seeing and feeling the spirit of unity inherent to the cultural sound ingrained in my DNA ‚Äî and foundational to my upbringing ‚Äî represented at Tiny Desk made me beam with pride. If this is your first exposure to soca music, I suggest you stretch and loosen up your waistline before pushing play on this one, because there is no sitting still when soca fills the room.\n\nSET LIST\n\"One More Time\"\n\"Dance With You\"\n\"Fast Wine\"\n\"Like Ah Boss\"\n\"Famalay\"\n\"Soca Kingdom\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMachel Montano: vocals\nDwain Antrobus: keys\nDuane Williams: effects\nBayete Williams: keys\nDamien Neblett: bass\nMelvin Alick: drums\nKyle Peters: guitar\nModupe Onilu: percussion\nRhys Thompson: percussion\nEtienne Charles: trumpet, fl√ºgelhorn\nLamar Robinson: background vocals\nMichael Chandler: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Nikki Birch\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Alant√© Serene, Mitra I.

Despite the rat plague and the typhoon risk. In New York City, too, there were simple dwellings for servants on rooftops - long before penthouses and rooftop bars came along.\n\nLike thousands of other people in Hong Kong, Cheng Chung Au lives in an illegally constructed ‚Äòcage flat‚Äô on the roof of a high-rise building. Over the decades, he‚Äôs come to terms with the rats and the typhoons. He and his wife couldn‚Äôt afford a regular flat and the waiting lists for social housing are long.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, there was also a ‚Äòcity above the city‚Äô in New York - for servants and workers. Then these very same spaces were developed into exclusive penthouse flats and rooftop bars. In the 1920s, plans for the Rockefeller Centre complex in Midtown Manhattan included rooftop gardens that were envisioned as a public park, with bridges to other buildings. The Great Depression prevented the project‚Äôs realization. \n\nToday, apartments on the upper levels of New York's mega-high-rise buildings are on the markets for hundreds of millions of dollars. In the future, newly constructed buildings with roof surfaces in the US metropolis will have to be greened or fitted with solar panels. Greenery can prevent sewers from overflowing during heavy rainfall. And the insulating effect of soil and vegetation saves cooling and heating energy. For activist Anastasia Cole Plakias, whose Brooklyn Grange is one of the largest rooftop farms in the US, the potential of green roofs is far from exhausted. \n\nRooftops are extreme zones: A refuge for people looking for a home, and a testing ground for the city of the future.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Martin introduces the #SOLID #DesignPrincipals as cornerstones for the construction of software that amenable to change.\n\nPart of a larger set of design principals1, the SOLID principals are closely associated with object oriented languages like C++, Java, C#, and more recently Ruby. And although they span different eras, all these languages share the same class structured, inheritance based foundations.\n\n#Go is one of a set of new languages that eschew inheritance, instead preferring the mantra of composition. Does this mean that Go programs do not follow the SOLID design principals, or even that Go is not an object oriented language?\n\nIn this talk I will explore the five core SOLID design patterns, discuss their applicability to Go programmers, and explain that while Go programs are not inheritance or class based, they adhere strongly to Martin‚Äôs principals. The audience will learn how well structured Go applications naturally follow the SOLID principals, leading to code which is loosely coupled, highly reusable, and inherently maintainable.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nTeiva Harsanyi ‚Ä¢ 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3P0R4cQ\nWilliam Kennedy, Brian Ketelsen & Erik St. Martin ‚Ä¢ Go in Action ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4iy8Npv\nMichael Stack ‚Ä¢ Event-Driven Architecture in Golang ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3G5e8ST\nJon Bodner ‚Ä¢ Learning Go ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41GOxvJ\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Golang #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #KenScambler #SoftwareDevelopment #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson, joined by co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly, dives into the mysterious world of hypnosis with clinical psychiatrist David Spiegel. What is hypnosis? Is it about losing control‚Äîor gaining it?\n\nWe explore the human mind and consciousness, asking if there‚Äôs a ‚Äúuser manual‚Äù for our brains. How does hypnosis work? Dr. Spiegel explains how our salience network, which processes external stimuli, can be ‚Äúturned down,‚Äù allowing us to engage deeply with our inner thoughts. Could this altered state offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?\n\nSome are more hypnotizable than others‚Äîwhy? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic‚Äîtargeted and potent, especially for managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well as for good? \n\nFrom recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis reveals its potential‚Äîand limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize medicine. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: David Spiegel\n03:15 - What is Hypnosis? \n06:55 - Is Everyone Hypnotizable? \n12:33 - The Default Mode Network\n14:20 - Hypnosis for Memory Recovery\n21:22 - Self Hypnosis v.

Toshiko Tanaka, then six years old, had survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. She hoped that this \"peace constitution‚Äù would prevent wars in the future. But now, Japan is arming itself again.\n\nAfter 1945, Japan was the only country in the world to commit itself to renouncing war in its constitution. But in the face of increasing dangers, the island nation has now announced a rearmament program. By the end of this decade, Japan could become the third strongest military power in the world. The pacifism born of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has given way to fear of aggressive neighbors like China, Russia and North Korea.\nUnder conservative governments and in view of the increasing withdrawal of the once-protective USA, the Japanese armed forces have acquired weapons systems. These include amphibious vehicles, US F-35 fighter jets and two aircraft carriers. There is enough plutonium from civilian use in the country to produce up to a thousand nuclear warheads. Missile systems are also available.\nAsia is the key to the future. This documentary shows a new side of Japan and provides insight into the military changes that are taking place there - far from the war in Ukraine. Toshiko Tanaka, one of the last hibakusha, as the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings are called, fears war once more. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #japan \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Rita was born in Togo in 1991 and was raised by her grandparents. For a long time, she thought they were her parents. Hers was a happy childhood - but it ended abruptly.\n\nAt the age of nine, she‚Äòs told that her biological mother lives in Munich and from now on, she must live with her.  Rita travels to Germany alone, where she receives a rather cold reception from her supposed mother. When Rita is abused by an acquaintance of her mother's, she‚Äôs too afraid to say anything.\n\nWith the help of her friends and a teacher, Rita finally moves into a child protection centre. Rita's suspicion that this woman is not her mother at all becomes more and more entrenched. A relative confesses to her that she is in fact her aunt and that her real mother lives in Togo. \n\nRita bounces back from the shock and at the age of 17, she begins a course in restaurant management. Everything seems to be going well, but the traumas of her childhood soon catch up with her. After several unsuccessful suicide attempts, Rita realizes: to get answers to her questions, she needs to travel to Togo. There, she uncovers layer upon layer of lies.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

As Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. \n\nThe US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. \n\nFluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains ‚Äî and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.  \n\nSources and further reading:\n\nThe new meta-analysis along with an editorial by Bruce Lanphear and Steven Levy can be found here: \nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control has more information on the history of community water fluoridation: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/timeline-for-community-water-fluoridation/index.html#:~:text=1956,over%20the%20next%20few%20decades\n\nUndark science magazine covered the communities in the US that have groundwater levels of fluoride that are higher than the World Health Organization maximum: \nhttps://undark.org/2024/05/06/tap-water-high-dose-of-fluoride/\n\nUndark‚Äôs podcast team made an episode where they interviewed two scientists on either side of the fluoride safety debate: \nhttps://undark.org/2024/12/23/podcast-fluoride-toxic-low-levels/\n\nHere is the Calgary study we mention: \nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542152/\n\nHere is the National Toxicology Program‚Äôs monograph that preceded the meta-analysis: \nhttps://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/ntp/ohat/oeccaaho/mgraph/occchemo_final20190300_508.pdf\n\nA similar study to the Calgary one found that water fluoride was beneficial in Juneau, Alaska\nhttps://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2019/02/happened-juneau-took-fluoride-drinking-water.cshtml","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2XkV-AMhBvo?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Software Architecture for Tomorrow: Expert Talk ‚Ä¢ Sam Newman & Julian Wood","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbbkOXcgDGQ","date":1736505255,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"content":"This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted.\nhttps://gotopia.tech\n\nRead the full transcription of this interview here\n (https://gotopia.tech/articles/334) \nSam Newman - Microservices Expert & Author of \"Monolith to Microservices\" & \"Building Resilient Distributed Systems\"\nJulian Wood - Serverless Developer Advocate at AWS\n\nRESOURCES\nSam\nhttps://twitter.com/samnewman\nhttps://hachyderm.io/@samnewman\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/samnewman\nhttp://samnewman.io\nhttp://samnewman.io/blog\nhttps://github.com/snewman\n\nJulian\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/julianwood.com\nhttps://twitter.com/julian_wood\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/julianrwood\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJulian Wood and Sam Newman delve into the complexities of software architecture, focusing on critical concepts such as microservices, asynchronous communication, and the importance of architectural decision-making.\nSam emphasizes the need for clear definitions in computing, particularly around terms like asynchronicity, advocating for an understanding of communication styles‚Äîevent-driven versus request-response‚Äîas pivotal for effective system design. They discuss the value of architectural decision records (ADRs) as tools for fostering collaboration and documenting trade-offs in decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, the conversation highlights the evolving role of AI in software development, stressing that while AI can assist in understanding and maintaining existing codebases, the human element of critical thinking remains essential in navigating the complexities of modern software systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Building Resilient Distributed Systems ‚Ä¢ https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-resilient-distributed/9781098163532\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Monolith to Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Building Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3dMPbOs\nRonnie Mitra & Irakli Nadareishvili ‚Ä¢ Microservices: Up and Running‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL\nMitra, Nadareishvili, McLarty & Amundsen ‚Ä¢ Microservice Architecture ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3fVNAb0\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

In Northern cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, they found strength and security in a range of Muslim organizations, from the India-based Ahmadiyya movement to the homegrown Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam. In this film, host Malika Bilal (Senior Presenter, Al Jazeera English) tells the story of these early Black American Muslim communities through a woman named Florence Watts, who moved to the bustling South Side of Chicago around 1910, where she found work as a cook and a maid. \n\nDrawing on the work of Sylvia Chan-Malik, (author of Being Muslim: A Cultural History of Women of Color in American Islam,) Malika discovers how Florence was drawn to the teachings of the Ahmadiyya missionary, Mufti Mohammad Sadiq. In 1923, she joined one of the first multi-racial Muslim communities in the country. That same year, Florence was featured in the Ahmadiyya magazine Moslem Sunrise, her image captured in one of the earliest known photographs of a group of Muslim women taken in the United States. Through Florence‚Äôs story, Malika discovers how these Muslim groups helped working-class Black Americans resist the confines of race in the United States and feel part of a global community of believers. They in turn helped to create a legacy of Islam that has been embraced by African Americans since.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

If the gut is doing poorly, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation -- or depression.

They speak openly about what is sometimes a taboo subject.\n\nJana Eberhart has a stressful everyday life. The student works as a model and is a passionate about sports. In fact, she‚Äôs about to take part in an Ironman competition. Can a change in diet strengthen her gut so that she can perform better? Sports and nutrition consultant Dr. Jens Freese accompanies Jana on her project over an extended period of time. What impact will dietary changes and other interventions have? \n\nFor actor and fitness influencer Philipp Stehler, careful management of the gut is essential. He lives with ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal inflammation condition. This disease almost cost him his life. His large intestine had to be surgically removed.

And while doing so, innocent lives are also being taken - leaving the authorities deeply alarmed.\n\nThey fear that conditions are starting to mirror those in the neighboring Netherlands, where a high-profile investigative journalist was murdered by hired guns, and judges and prosecutors have received death threats. Nor do the gangs responsible shy from intimidating politicians and the royal family. Struggling to find attorneys willing to defend key witnesses, European authorities have had to recruit lawyers from abroad. In an organized crime business worth billions of euros, anyone who stands in the way runs the risk of being targeted by the cartels. This global war rages on in Europe and is increasingly stretching the German state to its limits. The makers of this film accompanied the country's interior minister and senior law enforcement officials on their visit to South America to expand international cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking. They also talked to criminal lawyers, toxicologists and police investigators in this ever escalating conflict. Are the cocaine wars winnable, or is it already too late?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The Bachs included some 75 active musicians over a 200-year span, including superstar Johann Sebastian. The Kanneh-Mason household, from England, is just getting started, but boasts seven siblings, each classically trained, with a few having launched major careers, including the eldest, Isata, who brings three of her favorite pieces to our trusty Tiny Desk upright piano.\n\nIn her early years, Kanneh-Mason, like many budding pianists, practiced the easier works by Chopin. And, like visiting an old friend, she keeps returning to the so-called poet of the piano, but in this performance she plays the difficult and rambunctious finale to Chopin‚Äôs Third Piano Sonata. With cascades of chords, rippling arpeggios and romantic sweep, just getting to all of the notes is a major feat.\n\nAs a second course, Kanneh-Mason offers contrasting music by Franz Liszt, the ne plus ultra of Romantic era piano virtuosos, whose serene side gets the spotlight in the Consolation No. 3 ‚Äî dressed in diaphanous curlicues and lacy ornamentation.  \n\nKanneh-Mason closes with an arrangement of ‚ÄúSometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child‚Äù by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, a Black British composer who died young in 1912. Coleridge-Taylor holds a special place in the heart of Kanneh-Mason and her family because his father hailed from Sierra Leone, the birthplace of Kanneh-Mason‚Äôs mother.\n\n‚ÄúGrowing up, I never really saw any Black composers within the classical music field,‚Äù Kanneh-Mason explains. Now, with her career rising, she‚Äôs extending their legacy.\n\n\nSET LIST\nFr√©d√©ric Chopin: Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor - IV.
