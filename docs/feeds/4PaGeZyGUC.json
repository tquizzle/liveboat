What is important, and what can go? The better storage options become, the more difficult it is to answer this question.\n\nWe humans like to preserve everything, whether we’ve collected or created it. Be it sourdough starters, books or blood samples. We want to preserve objects, memories and even microorganisms. \n\nKarl de Smedt is the only sourdough librarian in the world. In St. Vith, Belgium, he keeps 144 sourdough starters from all over the globe, some of which are over 100 years old. Through his collection, he preserves the unique wild yeasts and microorganisms that create each sourdough. \n\nThe German National Library in Leipzig and Frankfurt preserves copies of all books, records and media published in or about Germany since 1913. There are 34 million physical media on the shelves. Digitization can solve the space problem, but also has its pitfalls. For example: data has to be constantly copied, as hard disks can become unusable.\n\nProf. Robert Grass from ETH Zurich is developing a particularly promising storage medium: DNA storage. It is extremely powerful, can be stored for over 1,000 years and can always be read. Data is converted into the DNA code and stored as artificial DNA.\n\nBioBank Dresden stores tumor samples, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid for research purposes. Evidence from criminal offenses is stored in the evidence room of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt am Main. This allows crimes to be re-analyzed using modern techniques and solved decades later.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice discuss the UAP hearings, unexplained cosmic phenomena, dark matter, and more with astrophysicist and NASA UAP chair David Spergel.\n\nDavid reveals what it’s like to investigate UFOs scientifically, explaining why most sightings turn out to be lens flares or misidentified objects— but also why the 1% of unexplained events still intrigue researchers. Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.\n\nSwitching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy. Learn how groundbreaking tools like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and collaborations with ESA’s Euclid mission aim to answer fundamental questions about the universe.  We discuss computational astrophysics and the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. From UFOs to cutting-edge astrophysics, this episode offers a clear-eyed look at the mysteries of the universe.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: David Spergel\n01:45 - How Much is Unexplained? \n9:07 - The UAP Hearings\n13:51 - Would NASA Keep the Aliens Secret?\n18:28 - Conspiracy & Eyewitness Testimony\n31:19 - Dark Matter & The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope\n40:07 - Star Evolution & Computational Astrophysics\n44:56 - Dark Matter & Dark Energy\n48:39 - Gravitational Waves at the Begining of the Universe\n53:04 - A Cosmic Perspective\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Workers endure starvation wages, and toxic materials in the jewelry endanger customers' health. This film uncovers the origins and production of these items.\n\nChinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu supply the world with trendy jewelry - chunky chains, sparkling earrings, and gold bracelets. Some 6,000 new lines are added every day to the Shein range alone. But behind the glossy façade lies a harsh reality. In the factories where these pieces are produced, grueling 60-hour workweeks are the norm, encapsulated in China’s infamous \"9-9-6” culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While the jewelry is dirt cheap, the workers bear the cost. The risks aren’t limited to factory conditions; the products themselves often endanger customers. Testing frequently reveals toxic heavy metals and harmful chemicals. Scientists featured in the film unpack the health implications, shedding light on the hidden dangers of this booming industry.\n\nTwo German family businesses, Bijou Brigitte and the Beeline Group, are making significant sales across Europe. Their sustainability reports offer vague promises and little transparency about supply chains, leaving customers in the dark about where and how their trendy jewelry is produced. The film crew traces the steps of the supply chain all the way to China to find out more.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

More than 30,000 people have been freed from its prisons, but a further 100,000 remain missing. Families are desperately searching for their loved ones - including Hind Gharz al Deen, whose son Hussam is missing.\n\nHussam disappeared eight years ago. Together with her younger son Ahmad, Hind visits hospitals, morgues and the notorious Sednaya prison to look for him. The family is one of thousands in Syria clinging to the hope of finding their loved ones alive. In one hospital, photos of recovered bodies cover a wall. Many of the victims are horribly disfigured - a further reason why the search is agonizing for family members.\n\nFor Ahmad, looking for his older brother in Sednaya prison is particularly distressing. He was imprisoned there himself after being arrested in 2018. The horrors he suffered still haunt him: the brutal conditions and the cruel torture. Ahmad recounts his experiences on December 8th, the day he and his fellow inmates were freed. Hind and Ahmad find no trace of Hussam, but they continue to search.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It only has 3,500 inhabitants, but it’s a geopolitical heavyweight. A border battalion with 600 elite soldiers makes its military presence felt.\n\nThe two 19-year-old recruits David Bratland and Jesper Bruseth are doing their military service in Kirkenes with the ‘Jegerbataljonen GSV’. The training program for border fighters, around 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, is tough. In winter, temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius are not uncommon here. Added to that, just a few hours of daylight. During orienteering on skis, the recruits don’t just hone their physical fitness, but also their ability to take responsibility for their own actions. Their task: to monitor the almost 200-kilometer-long border with Russia and - in the event of war - to defend it. Recently, the soldiers have also received heavy weapons training for anti-aircraft and anti-tank defense.\n\nNorway also demonstrates its claim to power and territory by promoting culture on behalf of the West. While David and Jesper cross the snow-covered expanses of the Norwegian tundra on skis, the Russian-born curator of the Barents Spektakel, Yevgeny Goman, is confronted with completely different challenges a few kilometers away on frozen Lake Förstevatne. The central element of the opening show of the art festival - a giant flying dragon - simply won't take off. But, in the end, the opening show the following evening turns out to be a great spectacle against hopelessness.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She presented a tiny piece of 1,300-year-old papyrus with an inscription: \"Jesus said to them: my wife...I dwell with her.”\n\nDespite its authenticity, the parchment was not recognized by religious authorities. However, two years later, in 2014, a new text was discovered in the British Library in London. It was a bombshell. This text tells of a marital relationship between Jesus and his 'wife,' Mary Magdalene. Could these revelations indicate that the couple had children? \n  \nThis documentary uses animation to bring clues to life, while taking a new scientific look at the question of whether or not Jesus might have had children. The film examines apocryphal relics -- from recently discovered tombs to ancient parchments. It analyzes inscriptions and the results of scientific tests. The aim is to shed light on one of the oldest mysteries in the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Many teams who become more confident in progress, or getting work done, often embrace the more ambiguous question of product, or “Are we meeting the needs of our customers”, with some customers buying, by paying for subscriptions, and others buying in, by showing (and glowing about) their use of the system.\n\nIn this session, I’ll share experiences helping companies adopt a customer and product / services approach. From small digital product companies to large enterprises who are IT focused, I will present an approach for moving to or augmenting an existing move towards impact driven work.\n\nTopics that will be covered include:\n• mapping teams to #products and services\n• early #ProductDiscovery\n• blending product discovery and #ProductDelivery\n• and if there is enough time, ideas for doing these things at scale.\n\nIf we run out of time, there is always the hallways, where some of the best conversations take place.

Antonio studies at Stanford and comes from a low-income family background. He’s been elected to the local council, where he gives a voice to his neighborhood and his community. Ofelia is one of a group of young residents. During the coronavirus pandemic, the three activists started to push back against what they describe as \"capitalist colonization.” They continue to campaign for those who’ve missed out on the economic miracle of the tech industry that’s sprouted up around them.\n\nWith their activism and creative methods of resistance, the residents of East Palo Alto inspire others to think about the world of tomorrow. They also show that it’s possible to stand up to the Internet giants.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.

Cyberbullies engage in a series of campaigns intended to provoke an intense emotional reaction from the victim. The film explores some of their most perfidious methods.\n\nTens of thousands of people have an Internet-based hobby. A cruel game that plays on online anonymity and looks something like this: Cyberbullies home in on victims through social media channels and begin goading them into online emotional outbursts. And clock up each one of these outbursts as a triumph.\n\nThe group profiled in the film has a hierarchical structure and calls itself the NWO, an abbreviation for \"New World Order” or also \"Nie Wieder Online”, or \"Never Again Online”. Members meet on the communication platform Discord, allocate their tasks and brag about their activities online. Some hack accounts to access personal data, others order pizzas or packages en masse in the name of the victims.\n\n*[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

That George Washington owned enslaved people who were Muslim? And that a Muslim diplomat broke his Ramadan fast in the White House in 1805? These are some of the facts that Aymann Ismail (staff writer, Slate Magazine) discovers as he explores the role that Muslims played in the imagination of America’s founding generation. Aymann’s journey takes him from George Washington’s Mount Vernon to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello but begins in the Library of Congress. Here he sees two books that symbolize the promise and contradictions of the early Republic; Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’an and an autobiography written by an enslaved African Muslim, Omar Ibn Said, who was brought to the United States during Jefferson’s presidency.  Through these books, Ayman discovers how some Muslims were included in the founders’ vision of religious freedom in the nascent Republic, while other Muslims were denied all their rights, because of their race and legal status. \n\nThe film features interviews with Keith Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress,) Denise A. Spellberg (author of Thomas Jefferson’s Qur’an: Islam and the Founders), and Jeffrey Einboden (author of Jefferson’s Muslim Fugitives: The Lost Story of Enslaved Africans, their Arabic Letters, and an American President). \n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric.

Andrew discusses psychological safety as vital for empowering teams to innovate while maintaining accountability, advocating for experimentation and collective ownership of evolving codebases. Together, they underline the importance of balancing creativity and structure to build resilient, adaptive systems that thrive in complexity.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:40 From blog to book\n06:00 Evolving architectural decision-making\n11:35 Decentralized decision-making\n22:57 The transformative power of writing\n26:58 Balancing decision-making & accountability in software architecture\n32:04 Harnessing reframing & bias awareness for better decisions\n38:02 Psychological safety & accountability in decentralized decision-making\n42:26 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nDonald G.
