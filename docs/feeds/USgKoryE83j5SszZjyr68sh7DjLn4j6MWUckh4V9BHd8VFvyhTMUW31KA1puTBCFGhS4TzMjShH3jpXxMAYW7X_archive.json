New here.</p> <p>I&#39;ve got 2 RPi&#39;s - one running HA and another as a media server. I&#39;m looking to upgrade this for my families needs (mainly for storage), and decided to go down the DIY unRAID route now that I have a bit of time. I looked through other similar posts, but I&#39;m not much of a tinkerer (never built a server before), and I could do with a sanity check.</p> <p><strong>Needs</strong></p> <p>- Home automations<br/> - Media server (possibly serving 5 concurrent devices)<br/> - Security system surveillance</p> <p><a href=\"https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/DW2L9C\">This is my WIP build</a>. I&#39;m aiming for affordable, but good enough to scale. I feel like I&#39;ve gone way over that, but I&#39;m not sure how I can cut down the cost without a) smaller storage, or b) a board without a spare M.2 slot (which, as I understand it, would make scaling a lot harder).</p> <p>Grateful for any advice, thank you very much in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/picopau_\"> /u/picopau_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1hofryx/building_my_first_server_need_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1hofryx/building_my_first_server_need_help/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Why use Plex with Unraid","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1hoek24/why_use_plex_with_unraid/","date":1735417876,"author":"/u/konaabyss","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>New to the community and has a question as I canâ€™t choose between Jellyfin or Plex. </p> <p>Why are you, a Unraid member, utilizing Plex over Jellyfin?
