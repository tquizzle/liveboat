The only thing that helps is then restarting the process or the server. I am using a proxmox VM with Debian 12, installed AdGuard Home via the automated install (<a href=\"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#getting-started\">GitHub - AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome: Network-wide ads &amp; trackers blocking DNS server</a>), the VM was reinstalled clean twice but the problem persists. It is a naked Debian 12 without any other software installed. The vm has 4 vCPUs assigned and 4 GiB of RAM, qemu-guest-agent is installed properly. </p><p>In the journalctl log, there is nothing to see at the time, AdGuard Home stops responding, the only thing thats remarkable is, that stopping the process fails with timeout:</p><p><code>Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564208 [info] Received signal \"terminated\"</code><code>Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564254 [info] stopping AdGuard Home</code><code>Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564322 [info] webapi: stopping http server</code><code>Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564422 [info] webapi: stopped http server</code><code>Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard AdGuardHome[761]: 2025/03/09 00:15:00.564427 [info] service: stopping: waiting for cleanup</code><code>Mar 09 00:15:00 adguard systemd[1]: Stopping AdGuardHome.service - AdGuard Home: Network-level blocker...</code><code>Mar 09 00:16:30 adguard systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: State 'stop-sigterm' timed out.
