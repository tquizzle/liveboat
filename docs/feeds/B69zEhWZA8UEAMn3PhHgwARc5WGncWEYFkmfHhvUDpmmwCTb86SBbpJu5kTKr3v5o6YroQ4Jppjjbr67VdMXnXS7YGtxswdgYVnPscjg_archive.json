In this episode with Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, we’re going to talk about how to tune into the value of disruption, and learn how to sit with the chaos. \n\nZenju Earthlyn Manuel is an ordained Zen priest, holds a Ph.D., and worked for decades as a social science researcher and development director for non-profit organizations. She is also a prolific author.\n\nIn this conversation we’ll explore: what to do with the unknown and not having any answers; the power of a “sip of silence” (her term); what she means by the phrase “death as a doorway to tenderness;” how she defines tenderness - a word that can easily get bogged down in sloppy sentimentality; and what she meant when she wrote “I'm not advocating love as an answer to all of the ills of the world. Then again, it is just that simple to be love.”\n\nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/K3VN-0pAMOQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Make This The Best Year Of Your Life | Vinny Ferraro","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI9bIdQF8A","date":1735237778,"author":"Ten Percent Happier","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Contemplating your own death can feel like a massive bummer at first, but there’s good news: how you react to that inescapable fact really matters. \n\nVinny Ferraro has practiced insight meditation (vipassanā) since the mid-90s.

This never-enough-ness can lead to an ambient level of self-loathing that can be incredibly destructive. That's where \"radical self-love\" comes in.\n\nOur guest today is Sonya Renee Taylor. She is the author of three books, including The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love. She is the Founder and Radical Executive Officer of The Body is Not An Apology. She has come to this work as a result of her own personal pain, as a Black woman inhabiting a body that she says does not conform to societal norms. \n\nIn this conversation, we talk about defining radical self-love (and why she believes it's our natural state), tools for cultivating radical self-love, and the connection between being OK with yourself and the larger society. \nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/spmRMjwJdBQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Do Life Better | Dan Harris and DJ Cashmere","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpw4iiFWXqE","date":1734688806,"author":"Ten Percent Happier","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Dan and Executive Producer, DJ Cashmere, pull back the curtain on what we do, how we do it—and what’s coming next.\n\nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Mpw4iiFWXqE?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"3 Tips for Holiday Stress #tenpercenthappier #anxiety #holiday","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS3OGu9zxo","date":1734616251,"author":"Ten Percent Happier","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Learn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/4RS3OGu9zxo?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"For me its elevators and airplanes.
