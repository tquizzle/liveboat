A score of 100 percent would mean full equality with men. African women are a long way from that.\n \nIn 2023, African women scored just over 50 percent — so only halfway to complete gender equality across economic, social, and public leadership areas. It is a sobering statistic that shows only a slight improvement from 48.6 percent in 2019.\n \nBut there is some light in the darkness: Namibia, the highest-ranking country in the continent, scores 88 percent. The report calls it 'the African champion of gender equality'. Tiny Lesotho, a gender equality giant, scores 82 percent. Its constitution guarantees equal pay for women and men. And Rwanda scores almost 80 percent — The report says it has a 'strong political will for gender equality'. That might have something to do with the fact that 61 percent of Rwanda's elected representatives are women.\n \nBut elsewhere, the landscape is less promising. In regard to the extent to which men and women participate equally in decision-making in politics, government and business, things have improved slightly but that rate is so slow, it would take until 2063 for African women to achieve full equality.\n\nFrom: DW News Africa with Michael Okwu, 6 March 2025\n\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>","contentLength":1782,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/XLy_QmrKJgU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"After Russian strikes on Kharkiv: US and Ukraine to hold talks in Saudia Arabia | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6kbTgVoISw","date":1741439520,"author":"DW News","guid":490,"unread":true,"content":"<article>America's top diplomat Marco Rubio says US president Donald Trump is determined to end the war in Ukraine 'as soon as possible'.
