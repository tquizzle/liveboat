The tower is the exact same system as in the first photo One ups is in the photo and working. Second one will be on the tower system and on all the networking stuff once I get batteries. Both are 1500va </p> <p>I ended up upgrading to a 2.5gbe link between everything and eventually 10g fiber between all of the systems. Gonna be adding a centralized storage system for both proxmox nodes which is what I want fiber for to make it worth it.</p> <p>I couldn&#39;t have gotten this far without my brothers help and with finding insane deals on both of those Dell servers.</p> <p>Happy new years yall</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/turbocharged5652\"> /u/turbocharged5652 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hongzs\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hongzs/1_year_laterslightly_nicer_but_still_in_progress/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Couldn’t find a Dual M710Q Mount I liked so designed and printed one.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1holmkk/couldnt_find_a_dual_m710q_mount_i_liked_so/","date":1735438333,"author":"/u/IamStubbyTech","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1holmkk/couldnt_find_a_dual_m710q_mount_i_liked_so/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/20j2ysy55p9e1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6189800103f47a69ecb17f50a285d0bac09e91\" alt=\"Couldn’t find a Dual M710Q Mount I liked so designed and printed one. \" title=\"Couldn’t find a Dual M710Q Mount I liked so designed and printed one. \" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Was looking for a good way to mount 2x M710Qs in rack without having to use a shelf and couldn’t find one I liked.

I just want to show off. These guys are a part of me - MacBook Pro mid-2010 and Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Raspberry is an energo-effective k3s cluster control plane, and laptop is a heart of my setup - its a k3s worker node with GitHub Actions runner and NFS, i use for system and data backups. I dont buy anything, i only build everything out of things i have. Raspberry struggles to run k3s, so i have 32GB USB plugged in for swap. Usually it takes 2-3 attempts to successfully initialize cluster. Everything is connected to my router, which is connected through 5GHz wifi to the main router - it gives internet to my hardware and connects them all. Btw, raspberry was successfully overclocked from 1.2 to 1.6GHz, and got 30-35% performance improvement. Laptop is locked at 1.6GHz instead of stock 2.4GHz, to prevent thermal throttling. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HyperWinX\"> /u/HyperWinX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/61h3pa729m9e1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1ho96ul/my_lil_home_setup/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
