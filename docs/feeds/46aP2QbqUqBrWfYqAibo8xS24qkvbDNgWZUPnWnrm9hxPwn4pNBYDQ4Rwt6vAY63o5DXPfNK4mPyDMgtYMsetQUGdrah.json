It&#39;s a pretty simple workflow for taking notes. I have a topic I want to take notes on, lets say cell membranes and I (try) to take atomic notes which are all linked together but also back to the cell membrane. So you can look at each individual part but also at the big picture, which is cell membranes. How do you work in obsidian? What is your workflow? What are some pros and cons?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpWyinDUQxc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpWyinDUQxc</a> -&gt; This is a video of me just taking notes on cell membranes.
