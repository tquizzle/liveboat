He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  \n\nWe explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.  \n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VTBQQ2V\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/Eywd4Ly\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Shop: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Bernardo Huberman*\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-huberman-39b40823 \nX: https://x.com/bhuberman \nThe Laws of the Web (book): https://amzlink.to/az0I0G65K03ya \nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b_GVwg0AAAAJ \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo-Huberman \nCableLabs: https://www.cablelabs.com/blog/author/bhuberman \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Bernardo Huberman\n00:02:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:05:08 Early School, Science Interest, Argentina; Soccer\n00:12:29 Physics, Childhood Teacher, Family\n00:20:48 Music; Dictatorship; Humanistic Education\n00:29:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 US Graduate School \n00:39:27 Counterculture, Peer Pressure; Graduation, Job Search\n00:49:19 Xerox, Personal Computers; Risk-Takers, Tachyon\n00:54:49 Sponsors: LMNT & ExpressVPN\n00:57:33 Relativity Theory, Quantum Mechanics\n01:05:53 Chaos Theory, Fractals, Butterfly Effect\n01:17:21 Scientists, Positive Contributions & Flaws\n01:26:19 Sponsor: Mateína\n01:27:45 Enjoyment of Life, Meditation; Goal Pursuit \n01:35:44 Changing Fields, Computers\n01:43:24 Mentors, Students; Restlessness, Curiosity\n01:47:41 Industry, Academia, Graduate Degrees\n01:54:02 Podcast, Interviewing; Mistakes, Working with Others\n02:05:48 Quantum Internet, Unbreakable Code\n02:09:48 Physics & Neuroscience; AI\n02:15:06 Analog vs. Digital Life, Thinking about Future\n02:21:38 Worry, Meditation\n02:24:22 Beliefs, God; Spiritual Experiences, Randomness\n02:33:53 Thinking about Past; Nostalgia\n02:39:19 Politically Incorrect; Libertarians; Cryogenics; Enjoying Life\n02:46:30 Joyful; Pushing to Limits; Worry & Enjoyment, Living with Elegance\n02:55:57 Etiquette, Clothing\n03:04:11 Retirement, Money, Travel\n03:12:00 Future Plans; Joyful Life\n03:13:33 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Curiosity #Science \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tR73Ny4Dt9s?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Understand and Use Dreams to Learn and Forget | Huberman Lab Essentials","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF32FvBH4gI","date":1734008452,"author":"Andrew Huberman","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain the important role that sleep and dreams have in learning, regulating emotions, and recovering from trauma.\n\nI discuss how dreams during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep contribute to emotional learning and the processing of traumatic experiences.

However, the data show that while venting strengthens social bonds, it also makes both the complainer and the listener more unhappy and amplifies negative emotions for both parties. Essentially, venting is counterproductive if your goal is to feel better.\n\nThis is interesting, considering that nearly all of us are prone to venting to some degree.\n\nNote: The data on journaling (covered in this and a previous Huberman Lab episode) strongly suggest that processing bad experiences doesn’t do much to relieve the associated negative emotions. There’s something intriguing about the differences between journaling to oneself and complaining or venting to others.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/1SXDXdngX2M?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Morgan Housel: Understand & Apply the Psychology of Money to Gain Greater Happiness","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5W74QC3v2I","date":1733144479,"author":"Andrew Huberman","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"In this episode, my guest is Morgan Housel, an expert in private wealth generation and management and author of the bestselling book The Psychology of Money. We discuss how desiring, pursuing, saving, and spending money impact our psychology and perception of wealth. We explore why people tend to either overspend or oversave and examine the most common mistakes made in the pursuit of financial freedom. Additionally, we discuss how to best use money — and one’s relationship with it — as a tool to create psychological security, freedom, and a deeper sense of life purpose.\n\nWe also delve into the impact of purchases, social media, and wealth signaling on our internal reward circuits, the dangers of using money as a gauge of career progress or self-worth, and the healthiest psychological stances to adopt while building wealth at any level. By the end of the episode, listeners will have gained numerous practical tools for making smarter financial decisions and should have a clearer understanding of the role money plays in their psychology, happiness, and life.\n\nRead the full show notes for this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/xNY9PwA\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/yny2Ghe\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nWealthfront**: https://wealthfront.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman \n\n**This experience may not be representative of the experience of other clients of Wealthfront, and there is no guarantee that all clients will have similar experiences.
