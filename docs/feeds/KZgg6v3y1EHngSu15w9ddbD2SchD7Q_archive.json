After reaching 350+ sets in my collection and now helping my son manage his own LEGO journey, I found that Brickset, Rebrickable, BaseBrick, Peeron, and Bricklink all fell short when it came to tracking sets and especially missing pieces across multiple copies of the same set.</p> <h1>Why I Built This</h1> <p>I keep all my sets inventoried in separate containers, and I wanted a simple way to track which sets are complete and which have missing pieces. When you&#39;re managing hundreds of sets and pieces occasionally go missing (as they do!), it becomes really challenging to keep track of everything with existing tools.</p> <h1>What can it do?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Track multiple copies of the same set</strong> - Each set gets a unique ID, so you can track different missing pieces across duplicate sets</li> <li><strong>Manage missing pieces</strong> - Keep track of what&#39;s missing across your entire collection</li> <li><strong>View your complete inventory</strong> - See all parts and minifigures across your sets</li> <li><strong>Smart image handling</strong> - Images are downloaded once and stored locally, so you&#39;re not constantly hitting Rebrickable&#39;s API</li> <li><strong>Instructions management</strong> - Add PDF instructions for easy access</li> <li><strong>Wishlist support</strong> - Keep track of sets you want to add to your collection</li> </ul> <h1>Screenshots</h1> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/koLAhiWe94.png/raw\">Main interface with set overview</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/MeXaYuVI44.png/raw\">Parts inventory</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/YEPEKOsE50.png/raw\">Missing pieces tracker</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/RuWoduFU08.png/raw\">Minifigure collection</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://xbackbone.baerentsen.space/LaMU8/hACAbArO44.png/raw\">Wishlist</a></li> </ul> <h1>Tech</h1> <p>It&#39;s built with Python3, Flask and SQLite, runs in Docker, and only requires a Rebrickable API key to get started. All the code is available on my <a href=\"https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\">Gitea</a> instance, and setup is pretty straightforward with Docker Compose.</p> <h1>Note</h1> <p>This has been a hobby project that&#39;s grown over time, so don&#39;t expect enterprise-grade code! It&#39;s built to solve real problems I&#39;ve had managing my LEGO collection, and I figured others might find it useful too.</p> <h1>Try it out!</h1> <p>You can find the project here: <a href=\"https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker\">https://gitea.baerentsen.space/FrederikBaerentsen/BrickTracker</a> If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask.

The crashes occurred on different chargers (one 5V/3A, one stronger), on different SD cards. The SD cards are quite dated, could this be the reason? Or the chargers (even though they should technically be working according to the documentation)? Most of the posts about this error that I&#39;ve found are talking about some dated Raspberries, which have probably died, this one is new so I&#39;d expect it to work 100% of the time not just *most* of the time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ComprehensiveWay7547\"> /u/ComprehensiveWay7547 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hmlvt0/occasional_sdram_failures/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hmlvt0/occasional_sdram_failures/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Raspberry pi camera closer/shutter (is there one out there?)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hmluwt/raspberry_pi_camera_closershutter_is_there_one/","date":1735209433,"author":"/u/SpiderUnderUrBed","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am talking about, if there is any extension to the raspberry pi camera, I have a camera module 3, which has a shutter to block images and videos, I prefer that over unplugging the wire that connects the camera to the pi, because its difficult to open my case and its a bit risky when on so I have to turn it off.

They use it to plan their day, decide what to eat, and to decide how to respond to other people&#39;s text messages. However, it&#39;s gotten so bad to the point where she admitted to me that she spent half a day, in bed, talking to ChatGPT about her love horoscope using a &quot;template&quot; she found on Tiktok.</p> <p>The other day, she asked me for advice on whether or not she should give out her personal Instagram to people she will be networking with as part of her job. I told her it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea and gave my reasons for it. Then she goes &quot;You know what, I&#39;ll just ask ChatGPT when I get home later to see if it&#39;s a good idea.&quot; At that moment, I realized she trusted ChatGPT more than me. We&#39;ve been friends for more than 11 years.</p> <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand ChatGPT is a very useful tool. I use it for school work and to help me study efficiently. However, I think for her it&#39;s gotten to the point where she cannot survive without ChatGPT.</p> <p>Edit: To clarify, I told her that giving out her personal, private instagram to potential clients she might work with is probably not a smart move. She said she felt pressured to do so because she saw others around her doing it. I understand it&#39;s her business whether or not she wants to, but like I said she asked for my advice. If it was a personal IG used for networking or for &quot;connecting&quot; with others, I would have said go for it. I would consider her a pretty private person, which is why I said what I said.

Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? \n\nIf generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? \n\nIf a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? \n\nToday, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor.
