Here's the pitch:<p><i>Anki AI Utils</i> is a suite of AI-powered tools designed to automatically improve cards you find challenging. Whether you're studying medicine, languages, or any complex subject, these tools can:<p>- <i>Explain</i> difficult concepts with clear, ChatGPT-generated explanations.<p>- <i>Illustrate</i> key ideas using Dall-E or Stable Diffusion-generated images.<p>- <i>Create mnemonics</i> tailored to your memory style, including support for the Major System.<p>- <i>Reformulate</i> poorly worded cards for clarity and better retention.<p><i>Key Features:</i><p>- <i>Adaptive Learning:</i> Uses semantic similarity to match cards with relevant examples.<p>- <i>Personalized Memory Hooks:</i> Builds on your existing mnemonics for stronger recall.<p>- <i>Automation Ready:</i> Run scripts daily to enhance cards you struggled with.<p>- <i>Universal Compatibility:</i> Works across all Anki clients (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS).<p><i>Example:</i><p>For a flashcard about febrile seizures, Anki AI Utils can:<p>- Generate a <i>Dall-E illustration</i> of a toddler holding a teacup next to a fireplace.<p>- Create <i>mnemonics</i> like \"A child stumbles near the fire, dances symmetrically, has one strike, and fewer than three fires.\"<p>- Provide an <i>explanation</i> of why febrile seizures occur and their diagnostic criteria.<p><i>Call for Contributors:</i><p>This project is battle-tested but needs help to become a polished Anki addon.

I just want to show off. These guys are a part of me - MacBook Pro mid-2010 and Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Raspberry is an energo-effective k3s cluster control plane, and laptop is a heart of my setup - its a k3s worker node with GitHub Actions runner and NFS, i use for system and data backups. I dont buy anything, i only build everything out of things i have. Raspberry struggles to run k3s, so i have 32GB USB plugged in for swap. Usually it takes 2-3 attempts to successfully initialize cluster. Everything is connected to my router, which is connected through 5GHz wifi to the main router - it gives internet to my hardware and connects them all. Btw, raspberry was successfully overclocked from 1.2 to 1.6GHz, and got 30-35% performance improvement. Laptop is locked at 1.6GHz instead of stock 2.4GHz, to prevent thermal throttling. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HyperWinX\"> /u/HyperWinX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/61h3pa729m9e1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1ho96ul/my_lil_home_setup/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Encryption","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1ho8s15/encryption/","date":1735402172,"author":"/u/datahoarderguy70","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>How many people encrypt their entire server, as in their array?

RomM is a beautiful self-hosted ROM manager that allows you to browse your collection and play older games in your browser. We&#39;ve seen tremendous growth this year, and it&#39;s all thanks to our amazing community of collaborators, beta testers and users, here and across other platforms. From the bottom of our hearts, for your unwavering support, we thank you. ❤️</p> <h2>Major milestones</h2> <p>In <strong>February</strong>, we added support for save, state and screenshot files, embedded <a href=\"https://emulatorjs.org\">EmulatorJS</a> to play retro games in the browser, and re-licensed under AGPLv3.</p> <p>In <strong>March</strong>, we reorganized as The RomM Project, centralized our repositories under a single owner organization, released the first version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/rommapp/playnite-plugin\">Playnite plugin</a>, and hit <strong>1K stars</strong> on Github. ⭐</p> <p>In <strong>April</strong>, we added <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com\">MobyGames</a> as a metadata source, rebuilt the upload dialog and reworked the scan page, offering different (re)scan speeds and levels.</p> <p>In <strong>May</strong>, we launched the <a href=\"https://romm.app\">romm.app</a> website, added support for system BIOS/firmware files, added sharable and private notes for games, and significantly improved library load times.</p> <p>In <strong>July</strong>, we completed a major overhaul of the UI, added creation of custom game collections/lists, set custom cover art from <a href=\"https://www.steamgriddb.com/\">SteamGridDB</a>, and welcomed the third member to our team. 🤝</p> <p>In <strong>August</strong>, we added support for <a href=\"https://tinfoil.io/\">Tinfoil for Switch</a>, embedded <a href=\"https://ruffle.rs/\">RuffleRS</a> to play flash games in the browser, and launched our <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/romm\">Open Collective page</a>.</p> <p>In <strong>September</strong>, we took some much-needed time off to recharge. 🏖️</p> <p>In <strong>November</strong>, we added individual tracking of progress, completions, and ratings, enabled the container to run offline, started calculating hashes for games, and welcomed our fourth team member. 🤝</p> <p>So far in <strong>December</strong>, we&#39;ve announced our upcoming Q&amp;A, launched our demo site, and hit <strong>2.5K stars</strong> on Github. ⭐</p> <h2>New year, new roadmap</h2> <p>So what&#39;s next for RomM? Our latest alpha release includes the first iteration of <a href=\"https://github.com/rommapp/romm/wiki/OIDC-Setup-With-Authentik\">authentication with OpenID/OIDC</a>, and is designed to support popular providers such as Authentik and Authelia.</p> <p>In the short term, we plan to support ROM-adjacent files in the library, like DLC, romhacks, patches, and more. We&#39;re also wrapping up an integration with RetroAchivements, and a major refactor of our backend, which paves the way for improved matching with TOSEC, No-Intro, and .DAT files, using precomputed hashes.</p> <p>In the long term, we plan to continue working on the most requested features, and tackling the highest priority items in our backlog. Rest assured that the dream of two-way device game &amp; save file sync is alive and well!</p> <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this post. From everyone on the team, happy holidays!</p> <p>P.S.: If you&#39;d like to submit questions to the Q&amp;A, please do so using <a href=\"https://forms.gle/9kVMcJDFXeUnvf5X7\">this form</a> by <strong>January 10th, 2025.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/arcaneasada_romm\"> /u/arcaneasada_romm </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ho8hff/romms_2024_yearinreview/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ho8hff/romms_2024_yearinreview/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Guide to Export as PDF book","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1ho84ql/guide_to_export_as_pdf_book/","date":1735400356,"author":"/u/ZyChin-Wiz","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1ho84ql/guide_to_export_as_pdf_book/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IsiyEMYZ5Z6RhDmp9uKuP8lCz2N4YhzAudaLGs4PC7I.jpg\" alt=\"Guide to Export as PDF book\" title=\"Guide to Export as PDF book\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time trying to export my note as a well formatted PDF but there seems to be no straightforward answer so here&#39;s a guide for anyone who needs it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/97sl63dyzl9e1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b9d485bd541fc8d2bcf25831dc55a00ce9093d\">https://preview.redd.it/97sl63dyzl9e1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b9d485bd541fc8d2bcf25831dc55a00ce9093d</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8ovrn1dyzl9e1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed8c9770b4090659a50e0bff753c58170a933039\">Sample output</a></p> <ol> <li><p>Optional: Install Better Export PDF and Automatic Table of Contents plugins from Settings &gt; Community Plugins &gt; Browse.

Simple to the point where all setup is done by editing the html source file and there is only one freeform \"weight\" textbox per exercise to manipulate. Data is autosaved as it is entered. It never nags or judges you except by showing the last date you entered data in for that day-of-the-week's exercises. The only quality-of-life feature is a super-simple rest period timer in the footer.<p>It has no external dependencies and only uses browser local storage. There is no possibility of monetizing it.<p>I was on the fence about sharing since it is such a small and simple project, but decided I would share here in case anyone is looking to make a fresh start in the new year and finds the philosophy appealing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526769\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526769</a></p>\n<p>Points: 121</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Plasticlist Report – Data on plastic chemicals in Bay Area foods","url":"https://www.plasticlist.org/report","date":1735330544,"author":"jeff18","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.plasticlist.org/report\">https://www.plasticlist.org/report</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42525633\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42525633</a></p>\n<p>Points: 597</p>\n<p># Comments: 180</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: I made a web app to bring children's drawings to life","url":"https://doodledreams.cc/","date":1735325415,"author":"vikmex","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Hey HN!<p>I used to spend hours drawing all kind of things as a kid.
