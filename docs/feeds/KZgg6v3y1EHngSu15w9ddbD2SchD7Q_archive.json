He was 76.</p><p>\n\tThe Texas-born Foreman became Heavyweight Champion of the World, and segued into a TV staple and pop culture icon. He was swept up in the swirl of decade-defining events surrounding Muhammad Ali as well as Joe Frazier and other high-wattage pugilists of the 1970s. In the 1990s, Foreman took advantage of the availablity of low-cost TV time to launch his Foreman Grill home grill product through a series of  infomercials that he hosted. </p><p>\n\tForeman famously had a close call in the ring in 1977 that drove him to quit boxing and declare himself a born-again Christian. He became an ordained minister in 1978 and began preaching in his hometown of Houston. He shocked the sports world when he returned to boxing in 1987 and wound up reclaiming his Heavyweight Champion title in 1994. Foreman retired from the sweet science for good in 1997.\n\n\t</p><p>\n\tIn addition to his business ventures, Foreman led Houston’s Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, where he preached four times a week.\n\n\n</p><p>\n\tIn recent years, Foreman had been involved with numerous documentary projects about his life, boxing and the era of his greatest fame. He was also the subject of the 2023 biopic “Big George Foreman,” from director George Tillman Jr. Khris Davis played Foreman in the Mandalay Pictures drama that focused on his improbable return to the ring in the 1980s and ’90s.</p><p>\n\tForeman’s family confirmed his death in an Instagram post on Friday.</p><p>\n\tBorn Jan. 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in extreme poverity in the east Texas city of Marshall, about 40 miles west of Shreveport, La. He first gained national fame after winning an Olympic gold medal in boxing at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City.</p><p>\n\t“Foreman often bullied younger children and didn’t like getting up early for school. Foreman became a mugger and brawler on the hard streets of Houston’s Fifth Ward by age 15,” according to <a href=\"https://www.georgeforeman.com/pages/biography\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Foreman’s official website.</strong></a></p><p>\n\tHe was eventually steered into boxing through the Lone Star state’s Lyndon B. Johnson Job Corps program. Foreman gained stature in the late 1960s and ultimately secured the Heavyweight Championship in January 1973 by defeating Frazier with six knockouts in a bout held in Kingston, Jamaica. The event also had the distinction of being the first boxing broadcast to air on the then-fledgling pay TV service HBO.\n\n\t</p><p>\n\tThe following year, Foreman faced a resurgent Ali in the event that received worldwide attention as the “Rumble in the Jungle,” held in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ali pummelled Foreman in the ring and dominated him on the PR front as well. Foreman went on to went his next five fights by knockout.</p><p>\n\tAfter his triumph of becoming the world’s oldest Heavyweight Champion, Foreman became a boldface name staple on TV, from daytime talk shows to “The Tonight Show” and “Late Night With David Letterman.” He was known for his folksy charm and for having a sprawling family of children and grandchildren. And his low-cost cooking device that allowed for easy indoor grilling — the George Foreman Lean Mean Grilling Machine — became a retail and direct response sales juggernaut starting in the early 1990s.</p><p>\n\tForeman also starred in the short-lived 1993 ABC family comedy “George,” playing a retired boxer who runs an after-school program for troubled students. He hosted NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” in 1994.</p><p>\n\tForeman had cameos and small roles in a host of TV shows and movies over the years, playing himself or a similar character, including “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,” “The Fighter,” “The Masked Singer,” “The Larry Sanders Show,” “Home Improvement” and “King of the Hill.”</p>","contentLength":3824,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43442917"},{"title":"How does mover work with VMs and what's the best way to back VMs up?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/1jgyqiw/how_does_mover_work_with_vms_and_whats_the_best/","date":1742611805,"author":"/u/Proper-Novel4527","guid":683,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I created a Windows VM on my cache drive a while ago, and I booted up a game to test something out, and it gave me a warning stating that the game was running off of an HDD and it was highly recommended to run it on an SSD instead.

You have not done so.</em></p><p><em> I have seen Monster Cable take untenable IP positions in various different scenarios in the past, and am generally familiar with what seems to be Monster Cable’s </em><em>modus operandi in these matters.  I therefore think that it is important that, before closing, I make you aware of a few points.</em></p><p><em> After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1985, I spent nineteen years in litigation practice, with a focus upon federal litigation involving large damages and complex issues.  My first seven years were spent primarily on the defense side, where <strong>I developed an intense frustration with insurance carriers who would settle meritless claims for nuisance value when the better long-term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle.</strong> In plaintiffs’ practice, likewise, I was always a strong advocate of standing upon principle and taking cases all the way to judgment, even when substantial offers of settlement were on the table.  I am “uncompromising” in the most literal sense of the word.  If Monster Cable proceeds with litigation against me I will pursue the same merits-driven approach; I do not compromise with bullies and <strong>I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds.</strong> As for signing a licensing agreement for intellectual property which I have not infringed: that will not happen, under any circumstances, whether it makes economic sense or not.</em></p><p><em> I say this because my observation has been that Monster Cable typically operates in a hit-and-run fashion.  Your client threatens litigation, expecting the victim to panic and plead for mercy; and what follows is a quickie negotiation session that ends with payment and a licensing agreement.  Your client then uses this collection of licensing agreements to convince others under similar threat to accede to its demands.  Let me be clear about this: <strong>there are only two ways for you to get anything out of me.  You will either need to (1) convince me that I have infringed, or (2) obtain a final judgment to that effect from a court of competent jurisdiction. </strong>It may be that my inability to see the pragmatic value of settling frivolous claims is a deep character flaw, and I am sure a few of the insurance carriers for whom I have done work have seen it that way; but it is how I have done business for the last quarter-century and you are not going to change my mind.  If you sue me, the case will go to judgment, and I will hold the court’s attention upon the merits of your claims–or, to speak more precisely, the absence of merit from your claims–from start to finish. <strong>Not only am I unintimidated by litigation; I sometimes rather miss it.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>I can relate to Denke’s final comment quoted above ….

It also contains a large\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkdata/units.txt\">data file</a> of physical quantities,\n   freeing you from having to look them up, and freeing you to make\n   effortless calculations without getting bogged down in the mechanics.\n  </p><p>\n   Perhaps you'll get the best idea of what Frink can do if you skip down to\n   the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#SampleCalculations\">Sample Calculations</a> further on this\n   document.  Come back up to the top when you're done.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink was named after one of my personal heroes, and great scientists of\n   our time, the brilliant Professor John Frink.  Professor Frink noted,\n   decades ago:\n  </p><blockquote><p><i>\"I predict that within 100 years, computers will be twice as powerful,\n     ten  times larger, and so expensive that only the five\n     richest kings of Europe will own them.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>\n   For those with a short attention span like me, here are some of the\n   features of Frink.\n  </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#HowFrinkIsDifferent\">Tracks units of measure</a> (feet,\n    meters, tons, dollars, watts, etc.) through all calculations and allows\n    you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them effortlessly, and makes\n    sure the answer comes out correct, even if you mix units like gallons and\n    liters.\n\n   </li><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#NumericTypes\">Arbitrary-precision math</a>, including huge\n    integers and floating-point numbers, rational numbers (that is, fractions\n    like 1/3 are kept without loss of precision,) complex numbers, and\n    intervals.\n\n   </li><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#DateTimeHandling\">Date/time math</a> (add offsets to dates,\n    find out intervals between times,) timezone conversions, and\n    user-modifiable date formats.\n\n   </li><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#TextTranslation\">Translates</a> between several human\n    languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,\n    Korean, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Swedish, and Arabic.\n\n   </li><li>Supports <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#UnicodeInFrink\">Unicode</a> throughout, allowing\n    processing of almost all of the world's languages.\n\n   </li><li>Supports <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IntervalArithmetic\">Interval Arithmetic</a> (also\n    known as ) in calculations, allowing you to\n    automagically calculate error bounds and uncertainties in all of your\n    calculations.\n\n   </li><li>Installs itself on your system in seconds using <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#JavaWebStart\">Java Web Start</a> and automatically keeps itself\n    updated when new versions of Frink are released.\n\n   </li><li>User interface has a <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ProgrammingMode\">Programming Mode</a>\n    which allows you to write, edit, save, and run extremely powerful programs\n    even on a handheld device.\n\n   </li><li>Frink has a simple but powerful system for drawing <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Graphics\">graphics</a> which are resizable, support transparency\n    and anti-aliasing, and can be printed or written to image files.  Graphics\n    can also have exact lengths, so that a 3-centimeter line is three\n    centimeters long when printed.\n\n   </li></ul><p>\n   Frink follows a rapid release schedule and is updated often.  That\n   doesn't mean that old programs will be invalidated, but that new, useful\n   features and optimizations are added all the time.\n  </p><p>\n   Keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/whatsnew.html\">What's New</a>\n   page to see new features and keep abreast of its developments.\n  </p><p>\n   While that page is the most detailed and constantly-updated source of\n   information about changes in Frink, I also announce new features on\n   Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frinklang\">@frinklang</a>.  And if\n   you want to follow Alan's personal ramblings for some reason, those are at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aeliasen\">@aeliasen</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   You can read (and watch using RealPlayer) my presentation <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/LL4.html\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Frink -- A Language for Understanding the\n   Physical World</i></a> that I gave on Frink at the Lightweight Languages 4\n   conference at MIT.  This discusses some of the design decisions of Frink,\n   how it has evolved, implementation details, and future directions for the\n   language.\n  </p><p>\n   If you have a frames-enabled browser, and you don't see a Frink sidebar to\n   the left, you can also <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkframe.html\">click here to try Frink in\n    a sidebar</a> as you read this.  (The sidebar mode doesn't give as many\n   hints, though.)\n  </p><p> On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,\n   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and\n   double-clicking the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frink.jar\"></a> file.  For more\n   startup options, see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#DownloadingFrink\">Downloading Frink</a>\n   section.\n  </p><p>\n   Another method of installation requires Java Web Start, which is installed\n   with most versions of Java.  Using Java Web Start  used to\n   be a great way to run Frink if you don't need to run programs from the\n   command-line.  (But you  still write and run programs from the\n   GUI using Java Web Start!)  If you do want to run programs from the\n   command-line, see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#DownloadingFrink\">Downloading Frink</a>\n   section below.  Java Web Start will allow you to automatically get the\n   latest version of Frink and will update Frink automatically when new\n   versions are available.\n  </p><ol><li>If you  have a recent version of Java, you can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://java.com/\">get it from Sun.</a>\n    (Link opens in new window.)\n     \n   </li><li>  Most major browsers have now disallowed Java plugins to\n    run in the browser.  However, if you have a Java Virtual Machine\n    installed, you probably still have Java Web Start installed, which you\n    need to invoke from the command-line with the command\n    .  In Fedora, you can make sure this is installed by\n    installing the  package from your package manager,\n     as root, typing  and then\n    one of the commands below.  In Debian-like environments, you may install\n    this by installing the  package,  as\n    root, typing <code>apt-get install icedtea-netx</code> and then one of the\n    commands below.\n\n   </li><li> If you're using Java version 7u51 or later, they\n    silently and incompatibly decided to change default security settings so\n    you'll need to open the Java Control Panel to allow Frink to run.\n    Otherwise you will see a dialog that says something like \"Application\n    blocked by security settings\" or \"Your security settings have blocked a\n    self-signed application from running.\"  (This silent change was made after\n    12+ years of the aforementioned method working fine.)\n    <p>\n     The best way to allow Frink to run is to follow the instructions <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/upcoming_exception_site_list_in\" target=\"_blank\">listed here</a> and add \n     to the exceptions list in step 7.\n     \n     </p><p> As always, Java's instructions and installer are\n     terrible, and the Java Control panel on Windows may actually be under\n     your Start menu as  | , or\n     under your Windows Control Panel, or if you start your Control Panel and\n     don't see it, Java's control panel will be hidden under \"32-bit Control\n     Panel.\"  And sometimes you'll have multiple versions of Java installed\n     and the one that gets started isn't the latest version. I had\n      of problems until I manually uninstalled  the\n     versions of Java on the Windows machine, reinstalled the latest version,\n     and uninstalled Frink and reinstalled it.  Sorry about that.  Windows and\n     Java integration is terrible.  (The  package for\n     Fedora and other installations contains a vastly better implementation of\n     Java Web Start.)\n\n   </p></li><li>Click one of the options below to install Frink: (see the screenshots below):\n    <ul><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frink.jnlp\">Swing Interface</a>\n      Prettier.  Requires Java 1.5.0 or later.\n      <p> If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,\n       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:\n      </p><p><code>javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frink.jnlp</code></p></li><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frinkwithlibs.jnlp\">Swing Interface with standard\n       libraries</a>.  This is a version of Frink that contains a variety of <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/frinklibs.fsp\">standard libraries</a> and useful programs.\n      It's a larger download, but the standard libraries change somewhat\n      infrequently and should only get downloaded when changes are made.\n\n      <p> If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,\n       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:\n      </p><p><code>javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frinkwithlibs.jnlp</code></p></li><li><a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frinkawt.jnlp\">AWT Interface</a> -\n      Not as pretty as the Swing mode, but will run on older JVMs.\n      <p> If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,\n       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:\n      </p><p><code>javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frinkawt.jnlp</code></p></li></ul></li></ol><p>\n   If you've read those <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://frinklang.org/faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings\">security notes</a>, and understood\n   what the security messages are telling you, and the warnings are still too\n   scary, (and you don't want to send me the $400 per year it would cost me to\n   remove at least one of them,) and you'd rather download a limited version\n   of Frink that runs in the most restrictive security sandbox (breaking some\n   features), then <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frinklimited.jnlp\">click here to install\n   a limited version of Frink.</a> Again, please read those <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://frinklang.org/faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings\">security notes</a> to see what\n   features will be unavailable if you choose this option.  You can always get\n   the full version of Frink later if you need those features.\n  </p><p>\n   If someone wants to send me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign \"Code\n   Signing Cerificate\", I'll sign it just for you.  It won't work any\n   differently.)\n  </p><p>\n   If you have an old version of Java Web Start, Frink will probably show up\n   in the \"Downloaded Applications\" section of the Java Web Start panel which\n   isn't immediately visible.  Use the  menu option to select\n   the Downloaded Applications tab.  It will also let you create a Frink\n   shortcut on your desktop or in your start menu.  The defaults in Java Web\n   Start before version 1.4.2 are set oddly so that the  time\n   you run Frink, it will ask you if you want to make a shortcut.\n  </p><p>\n   If you're using Linux, and Sun's Java release, only Java version 1.5 beta\n   and later will install shortcuts onto your desktop and start menu.  Highly\n   recommended.\n  </p><p>\n   The Swing version allows mixed fonts and colors.  Due to some performance\n   bugs in Sun's Swing implementation (like large paragraphs taking several\n   minutes to paint every time you resize or scroll,) it can be problematic.\n   As of 2008-08-25, the capabilities of the Swing and AWT interfaces are\n   about the same.\n  </p><p>\n   The AWT user interface has several modes.  The two-line conversion mode and\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ProgrammingMode\">programming mode</a> are shown below.  Small\n   devices usually can't run Swing, but all Java platforms should be able to\n   run AWT.\n  </p><p>\n   If your web browser supports Java 1.3.1 or later, try the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/FrinkApplet.html\">Java Applet-based interface</a>.  It looks and\n   works just like the GUI above, but it requires you to be connected to the\n   internet and must download for each session.\n\n   Your browser must support Java 1.3.1 or later, or you will need to get <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://java.com/\">download a newer version of Java\n    from Sun.</a>  It is extremely highly recommended that you have Java 1.5.0\n   update 2 or later.  This has been tested with Internet Explorer, Netscape\n   4.x, Netscape 6+, Mozilla (Windows and Linux), and Opera.\n  </p><p>\n   If you don't have a recent version of Java, you can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://java.com/\">get it from Sun.</a> (Link opens in\n   new window.)\n  </p><p>\n   (The certificate is just signed by me, so you'll get a warning.\n   Network access is necessary to use the network portions of Frink... like\n   currency calculations, translations, etc.  If you deny network access, the\n   non-network parts of Frink will work just fine.  If someone wants to send\n   me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign \"Code Signing Cerificate\", I'll\n   sign it just for you.  It won't work any differently.)\n  </p><p>\n   If the applet doesn't work for you, try the\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/frink.fsp\">web interface.</a>\n   It should allow you to use the latest version of the Frink engine.  It is\n   now powered by <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fspdocs.html\">Frink Server Pages</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   In this web interface, you can enter any Frink expression in the \"From:\"\n   box.  If you also enter a value in the \"To:\" box, it is treated as the\n   right-hand side of a conversion expression (that is, to the right of the\n   conversion operator  )\n  </p><p>\n   Thus, to convert 10 meters to feet, you can enter\n    in the \"From\" box and\n    in the \"To\" box, or, equivalently, type\n    in the\n   \"From\" box and leave the \"To\" box empty.  It does exactly the same thing.\n  </p><p> On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,\n   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and\n   double-clicking the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frink.jar\"></a> file.\n  </p><p>\n   If you're just using Frink for interactive calculations, or are happy using\n   the built-in programming mode and you're not writing running programs from\n   the command-line, see the \n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#JavaWebStart\">Java Web Start</a> section above.\n  </p><p>\n   (If you're looking for an installer for handheld devices, like Android, see\n   the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#SmallDevices\">Small Devices</a> section below.)\n  </p><p>\n   If you want to write full Frink programs  run them from\n   the commmand-line, you will need to get your own copy of Frink, and\n   have a Java 1.1 or later runtime environment on your machine,\n   1.4.2+ is recommended as it's less buggy.  The date calculations in\n   anything before Java 1.3 are rather bad,) you may download the\n   latest executable  file.  (Note that this changes\n   almost daily as I do more work, so download often.)\n  </p><p>\n   Otherwise, here are the steps to downloading Frink:\n  </p><ul><li>\n    If you don't have a recent version of Java, you can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://java.com/\">get it from Sun.</a> (Link opens in\n    new window.)\n\n   </li><li>(Double-clicking the file you just downloaded might start Frink in GUI\n    mode, depending on your operating system.  If that's not enough, read on.)\n\n   </li><li>\n    See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#RunningFrink\">Running Frink</a> section below for\n    directions for starting full Frink programs, running from the\n    command-line, etc. \n  </li></ul><p> On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,\n   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and\n   double-clicking the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/frink.jar\"></a> file.\n  </p><p>If you want to run Frink in command-line mode, here are a couple of\n   sample scripts you can use to start Frink.  <em>You will need to edit them\n    to match the paths on your system!</em></p><p>\n   (Note that the Linux/Unix shell script above has the option to run with\n   the  program, which gives you the ability to use the\n   up/down arrows to repeat and edit calculations, and even perform unit and\n   function completion!  See the instructions inside that file for configuring\n   rlwrap, and downloading the optional associated\n   files:   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/unitnames.txt\">unitnames.txt</a> and <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkjar/functionnames.txt\">functionnames.txt</a>)\n  </p><p>\n   In the samples below, you may need to replace  or\n    with the full path to your Java Virtual Machine,\n   whatever that may be.  Note that  is a Windows-only\n   command that simply starts Java without opening a console window.  You'll\n   probably replace this with  on other platforms.\n  </p><p>\n   The most general way to start Frink is to launch the\n    class:\n  </p><p><code>java -cp frink.jar frink.gui.FrinkStarter\n    </code></p><p>\n   (The above starter scripts use this class.  Look at them first.)  By\n   default, this starts in text mode but allows many command-line options to\n   start in different modes:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" summary=\"FrinkStarter options\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Starts in programming mode with a blank program\n      \n    </td></tr><tr><td>Starts the specified filename\n      in programming mode (this option is passed by double-clicking a file in\n      Windows if you have file associations set up.)\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Starts Frink in Swing mode, using the one-line\n      input mode (default is two-line input mode).

I'd suggest\n   using one of the scripts above and modifying it.\n  </p><p>\n   To run the jar file in text mode (only), use: <code>java -cp frink.jar frink.parser.Frink </code></p><p>\n   To run the jar file with the Swing GUI, (shown above under\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#JavaWebStart\">Java Web Start</a>,) use: <code>javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.SwingInteractivePanel </code></p><p>\n   The Swing GUI is the default action for the jar file, so this is the same as\n   saying:<code>javaw -jar frink.jar </code></p><p>\n   To run the jar file with the AWT GUI, which gives access to several modes,\n   including programming mode, use: <code>javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.InteractivePanel\n    </code></p><p>\n   To run the jar file and start the AWT GUI in programming mode, use: <code>javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.ProgrammingPanel\n    </code></p><p>\n   To run the jar file and start the Swing GUI in programming mode, use: <code>javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.SwingProgrammingPanel\n    </code></p><p>\n   If a single filename is specified in programming mode, this file will be\n   loaded into the interface.\n  </p><p>\n   To run the AWT GUI in full-screen size (this is primarily for small\n   devices,) use: <code>javaw -cp frink.jar frink.gui.FullScreenAWTStarter\n    </code></p><p>\n   Depending on your operating system, I recommend that you write a shell\n   script, batch file, or create a shortcut to let you run this even more\n   easily (see below for samples.)  To exit, use Ctrl-C, or send your\n   platform's end-of-file character (usually Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-D), possibly\n   followed by carriage return.  Or just close the window.\n  </p><p>\n   See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ProxyConfiguration\">Proxy Configuration</a> below for\n   additional options if you're running behind a HTTP or FTP proxy server.\n  </p><p>\n   Arguments passed in on the command-line are treated as names of Frink\n   programs to be executed.

If you want\n    faster integer and decimal performance, make sure you are\n    using <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/experimental.html\">Frink:The Next Generation</a> and Java\n    1.8 or later which uses my vastly improved algorithms.\n    \n   </li><li>For long-running programs, if you're using Sun's Java Virtual Machine\n    (JVM), use the  command-line switch to the\n     executable.  This starts the Server VM which optimizes\n    more aggressively and often improves performance of long-running programs\n    by a factor of 2, but at the expense of increased start-up time.  Note that\n    the server VM may not be available if you just downloaded the Java Runtime\n    Environment (JRE), and not the full Java Software Development Kit (SDK).\n\n   </li><li>If you're  starting long-running programs, and want the\n    fastest start-up time,  use the Server VM.\n    \n   </li><li>Like all Java programs, Frink can often run much faster if you allow\n    the JVM to use more memory at startup, leading to less-frequent garbage\n    collection.  In Sun's implementation, this is achieved by passing the\n    options  (for maximum Java heap size)\n    and  (for initial Java heap size) to\n    the  executable.  The  arguments are something\n    like  for 256 megabytes.  Note that this is at the expense\n    of other processes running on your system, and should be used sparingly\n    because allocating too much memory may cause your system to swap\n    excessively or run out of memory if set too high.\n    \n   </li><li>() If you're doing mostly large integer work\n   (factoring, primality testing, other number theory,) where most of the\n   runtime is spent in mathematical operations on very large integers, the <a href=\"http://www.kaffe.org/\">Kaffe</a> Virtual Machine compiled with the\n   incredibly fast <a href=\"https://gmplib.org/\">GMP</a> numerical libraries\n   works literally thousands of times faster than Sun's VM and its horribly\n   naïve algorithms.\n    \n    <p> Make sure that GMP is compiled with the\n     configure option <code>--enable-alloca=malloc-reentrant</code> or you'll\n     blow out the stack and crash with very large integers.\n\n    </p><p> As of the 2004-07-18 release of Kaffe, you must now\n     explicitly pass the  argument when running\n     Kaffe in order to use the GMP libraries.\n  </p></li></ul><p>\n   If you use a HTTP or FTP proxy server, you need to add some options to your\n   command lines (say, right after the word ) to use the\n   proxy if you want certain functions to work.  HTTP and FTP are used for the\n   following:\n\n  </p><p>\n   The following are settings for Sun's distribution of Java 1.4.1.

If there's a unifying principle in Frink, it could be considered\n   to be the <em>normalization of information</em>.  I'm trying to\n   simplify and unify the representation of data so that you can perform all\n   sorts of interesting operations on them.  Whatever that means.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink is optimized for doing quick, off-the-cuff calculations with a\n   minimum of typing, primarily so it can be used with handheld devices which\n   can make text entry difficult (especially symbols).  This doesn't mean that\n   Frink is unsuitable for doing large, very high accuracy calculations.  It\n   does those well, too, and the complicated calculations look just like the\n   simple ones.\n  </p><p>\n   To give an example, Frink represents  numerical quantities as\n   not simply a number, but a number and the units of measurement that\n   quantity represents.  So you can enter things such as \"3 feet\" or \"40\n   acres\" or \"4 tons\", and add, subtract, multiply, etc. these things\n   together.  Frink will track the resulting quantities through all\n   calculations, eliminating a large category of errors.  You can add feet,\n   meters, or rods all in the same calculation and the details are handled\n   transparently and correctly.\n  </p><p>\n   It also knows the ways that these units are interrelated-- a length times a\n   length is an area; length is a volume (if you believe in the\n   hypothetical Z axis); mass times distance times acceleration is energy.  If\n   you know something in one system of measurement you can convert it to any\n   other system of measurement.\n  </p><p>\n   All units are standardized and normalized into combinations a small number\n   of several \"Fundamental Dimensions\" that cannot be reduced any further.\n   These are completely arbitrary and configurable but are currently:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" summary=\"Fundamental Units\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>\n   Look at the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkdata/units.txt\">data file</a> for these\n   definitions (and my editorializing on the boneheadedness of many these\n   choices.)  The data file recursively defines all measurements in terms of\n   the fundamental units.\n  </p><p>\n   An exponent can be attached to each dimension.  For example, an area is\n   length * length which might be represented as .  Of\n   course, a negative exponent indicates  by that quantity,\n   so meters/second will be displayed as , or acceleration\n   (which can be represented as meters per second per second) is represented\n   as .\n  </p><p>\n   A subtle but important design goal of Frink is to \"do the right thing\" with\n   numbers.  Numeric values are automatically promoted to and from integers,\n   rational numbers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and more, all\n   without overflow or undefined behavior or rounding error.  Frink tries to\n   get the  answer, not the wrong answer as fast as possible.\n  </p><p>\n   Numeric values in Frink are represented in one of several ways:\n  </p><dl><dd>An arbitrarily large number with no decimal part.\n   Represented as a number with no decimal point, () or the special \"exact exponent\" form\n   .  An integer can also contain underscores for better\n   readability, </dd><dd>An arbitrarily large number which can be written as\n    integer/integer ( such as  or  ).\n    Rational numbers are first reduced to smallest terms; that is,\n     is stored as  and  is\n    stored as the integer </dd><dd>An arbitrary-precision floating-point number.\n    Currently, the number of decimal places calculated or displayed is limited\n    to 20 for efficiency reasons.  Any number containing a decimal point is a\n    floating-point number, such as  or , as\n    well as any approximate exponential such as  or\n    .\n    \n    <p>\n     As of the 2018-12-11 release, if a number with a decimal point has the\n     \"exact exponent\" indicator , it is turned into an exact\n     rational number or integer.  For example, the new exact SI value for\n     Avogadro's number  will become an exact\n     integer.  The exponents can also be negative, which will usually lead to\n     an exact rational number, such as  which produces the\n     exact rational number .\n    </p></dd><dd>Complex numbers are any number with an imaginary part.  The imaginary\n    unit is specified by the symbol .  For example, .  The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be any\n    of the numerical types listed above.</dd><dd>An interval represents a range of values, such as \n    where, depending on your interpretation, the actual number is unknown, but\n    contained within this range, or the number simultaneously takes on all\n    values within the range.  See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IntervalArithmetic\">Interval\n    Arithmetic</a> section of the documentation for more information.</dd></dl><p>\n   Frink knows about a wide variety of measurements.  You can usually type a\n   unit of measurement in a variety of ways.  Plurals are usually understood.\n   Case is important (and somewhat arbitrary until I do some normalization and\n   cleanup of the units file, but usually lowercase is your best choice.)  The\n   following are all examples of valid units:\n  </p><ul><li> (also one million, just maybe more readable.)\n   </li><li> (1.0x10, or approximately a million (floating-point))\n   </li><li> (1x10, or exactly a million (integer))\n   </li><li> (a dimensionless exact integer)\n   </li><li> (a floating-point number)\n   </li><li> (also a floating-point number)\n   </li><li> (a rational number, preserved as a fraction)\n   </li><li> (\"USD\" is the ISO-4217 currency code for the U.S. Dollar)\n   </li><li> (for now, shorthand for the U.S. dollar)\n   </li><li> (most common prefixes are allowed.)\n   </li><li>    (abbreviations of most prefixes and units are also allowed)\n   </li><li><code>100001000101111111101101\\\\2</code> (a number in base 2)\n   </li><li><code>1000_0100_0101_1111_1110_1101\\\\2</code> (a number in base 2 with\n    underscores for readability)\n   </li><li>  (a number in base 16... bases from 2 to 36 are allowed)\n   </li><li>  (a number in base 16)\n   </li><li>  (a number in base 16 with underscores for readability)\n   </li><li>  (Common hexadecimal notation)\n   </li><li>  (Common hexadecimal notation)\n   </li><li>  (Hexadecimal with underscores for readability)\n   </li><li><code>0b100001000101111111101101</code> (Common binary notation)\n   </li><li><code>0b1000_0100_0101_1111_1110_1101</code> (Binary with underscores for readability)\n  </li></ul><p>\n   If you're looking for a specific unit, and don't know how it's spelled or\n   capitalized, see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IntegratedHelp\">Integrated Help</a> section\n   below.\n  </p><p>\n   Or, if you're using the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/frink.fsp\">web interface</a>,\n   type part or all of the name in the \"Lookup:\" field and click \"lookup\".\n   Selecting the \"exact\" checkbox will only return exact matches, otherwise\n   you will get all lines containing that substring.  Try it for something\n   like \"<a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/frink.fsp?lookup=cubit\">cubit</a>\" and you'll see that\n   there are often lots of variations.\n  </p><p> You'll learn the most if you look at the voluminous and\n   fascinating <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkdata/units.txt\">data file</a> for more examples\n   of things you can do, and measurements that Frink knows about.\n  </p><p>\n   If you don't know the name of a unit or function, but can guess at it, you\n   can either read the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkdata/units.txt\">data file</a> for more\n   information, or use the integrated help.  Keep in mind that Frink is\n   case-sensitive, so you'll need to use the right capitalization of the names.\n  </p><p>\n   Unit or function names can be looked up by preceding part or all of the\n   name with a question mark.  This will return a list of all units and\n   function names  that string, in upper- or lower-case.\n   For example, to find the different types of cubits:\n  </p><p><code>[homericcubit, assyriancubit, egyptianshortcubit,\n    greekcubit, shortgreekcubit, romancubit, persianroyalcubit, hebrewcubit,\n    northerncubit, blackcubit, olympiccubit, egyptianroyalcubit,\n    sumeriancubit, irishcubit, biblicalcubit, hashimicubit]</code></p><p>\n   Or, if you want to know the name of the currency used in Iran,\n  </p><p><code>[Iran_Rial, Iran_currency, Iran]</code></p><p>\n   Simply enter the name of the unit you're interested in to see its value:\n  </p><p>\n   If you want to see the results in specific units of measurement, you\n   can use the arrow operator  as described in the\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Conversions\">Conversions</a> section below:\n  </p><p>\n   Or, if you want to see the sizes of all the units as a single unit type,\n   and they're all the same, you can use the arrow operator on the list.  The\n   following sample shows all the different types of cubits the world\n   has defined and converts them to inches:\n  </p><p><code>[homericcubit = 15.5625,\n    &nbsp;assyriancubit = 21.6,<p>\n    &nbsp;egyptianshortcubit = 17.682857142857142857,</p>\n    &nbsp;greekcubit = 18.675,<p>\n    &nbsp;shortgreekcubit = 14.00625,</p>\n    &nbsp;romancubit = 2220/127 (approx. 17.480314960629922),<p>\n    &nbsp;persianroyalcubit = 25.2,</p>\n    &nbsp;hebrewcubit = 17.58,\n    &nbsp;blackcubit = 21.28,\n    &nbsp;egyptianroyalcubit = 20.63,<p>\n    &nbsp;sumeriancubit = 2475/127 (approx. 19.488188976377952),</p>\n    &nbsp;irishcubit = 500000000/27777821 (approx. 17.99997199204358),\n    &nbsp;hashimicubit = 25.56]</code></p><p>\n   If you don't want to see exact fractions, you can (as always) multiply the\n   right-hand-side by  or  (without a zero\n   after the decimal point) to get approximate numbers:\n  </p><p>\n   If you use two question marks, the units that match that pattern will be\n   displayed </p><p><code>\n    moonlum = 2500 m^-2 cd (illuminance),\n    moondist = 0.002569555301823481845 au,<p>\n    moonmass = 73.483E+21 kg (mass),</p>\n    moonradius = 0.000011617812472864754024 au,<p>\n    moongravity = 1.62 m s^-2 (acceleration)</p></code></p><p> If you use the form with two question marks, you\n    convert them to a specified unit with the\n    operator, as they have already been converted to a\n   single string.\n  </p><p> As of the 2016-07-06 release, the double-question-mark\n   operator now returns  with newlines separating each\n   entry, instead of a list of strings.\n  </p><p>\n   Note that functions are displayed at the end of the list, and can be\n   distinguished from units by the square brackets following them:\n  </p><p><code>\n   callistodist = 1.883000000e+9 m (length),\n   callistoradius = 2.400000e+6 m (length),<p>\n   callistomass = 1.08e+23 kg (mass),</p>\n   callJava[arg1,arg2,arg3]</code></p><p>\n   In addition, the  function will produce a list of\n   all functions.\n  </p><p>\n   If you're writing Frink programs, you can edit Frink files in your favorite\n   text editor.  If that happens to be Emacs or XEmacs, you can download the\n   rudimentary <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinktools/emacs/frink-mode.el\">Frink mode for\n    Emacs</a>.  It's somewhat rough at this moment, but it has syntax\n   highlighting, automatic indenting, ability to run interactive Frink\n   sessions or programs.  Screenshot is below.\n  </p><p>\n   By default, the output is in terms of the \"fundamental units\".  To convert\n   to whatever units you want, simply use the \"arrow\" operator\n    (that's a minus sign followed by a greater-than sign,)\n   with the target units on the right-hand side:\n  </p><p> If the right-hand-side of the conversion is in\n   double quotes, the conversion operator will both evaluate the value in\n   quotes as a unit and append the quoted value to the result.  So, the above\n   example could be performed as:\n  </p><p><code>7239/625 (exactly 11.5824) meters</code></p><p>\n   In this case, because the ratio between feet and meters is an\n   exactly-defined quantity, so the answer comes out as an exact rational\n   number.  This is also displayed as a decimal number for your convenience.\n   If you just want the decimal value, you can multiply by an approximate\n   decimal number (any number containing a decimal point) such as\n    or  without anything after the \n   decimal point:\n  </p><p> If you are using the web-based interface, simply enter\n   everything left of the arrow in the \"From:\" box and everything to the right\n   of the arrow in the \"To:\" box.  Or you can enter the whole expression\n    the arrow in the \"From:\" box and leave the \"To:\" box\n   empty.  It does the exact same thing.\n  </p><p>\n   If the units on either side of a conversion are not of the same type, Frink\n   may try to help you by suggesting conversion factors:\n  </p><p><code>\n    &nbsp;Conformance error -\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left side is: 15367/625 (exactly 24.5872) m s^-1 (velocity)<p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;Right side is: 1143/1250 (exactly 0.9144) m (length)</p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestion: multiply left side by time<p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or divide left side by\n    frequency</p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units[time]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units[frequency]<p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to list known units with these dimensions.\n   </p></code></p><p>\n   If you get an error like this, you can list all the units that have the\n   specified dimensions by typing  or\n   .\n  </p><p>\n   Yes, sometimes it gives digits which aren't significant in results.

For example, to find out how long it takes the earth to rotate on\n   its axis:\n  </p><p><code>siderealday -&gt; [hours, minutes, seconds]</code></p><p>\n   or, to maintain symmetry with the quoted-right-hand-side behavior noted\n   above, arguments on the right-hand-side can be quoted:\n  </p><p><code>siderealday -&gt; [\"hours\", \"minutes\", \"seconds\"]</code><code>23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds</code></p><p>\n   This behavior can also be used to break fractions into constituent parts:\n  </p><p>\n   If the first term is the integer  (zero), any leading terms\n   with zero magnitude will be suppressed:\n  </p><p><code>siderealday -&gt; [0, \"weeks\", \"days\", \"hours\", \"minutes\", \"seconds\"]</code><code>23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds</code></p><p>\n   If the last term is the integer  (zero), any remaining\n   fractional part  will be suppressed:\n  </p><p><code>siderealday -&gt; [\"hours\", \"minutes\", \"seconds\", 0]</code><code>23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds</code></p><p>\n   Math is very straightforward: the current parser accepts the normal\n   mathematical operators, with normal operator precedence.  (Exponentiation\n   first (see notes below,) then multiplication and division, then addition\n   and subtraction.  And more tightly parenthesized expressions are performed\n   before anything else.)  All expressions can be arbitrarily complex.\n   Parentheses can be used to group expressions.\n  </p><p> Whitespace between any two units implies multiplication!\n   This has the same precedence as multiplication or division.

The factorial operator \n   follows after an expression and has a precedence \n   exponentiation, following normal mathematical precedence rules.  Yeah, when\n   I say  or  or , I'm not\n   just being super-enthusiastic about that number.  It's a common\n   mathematical operator.\n  </p><p> the factorial of a non-negative integer  is\n   the product of all the numbers from  to .  For\n   example, the factorial  is equal to\n   .  These grow rapidly and become hard to\n   calculate, but Frink calculates them exactly.\n  </p><p>\n   Here are some notes about the implementation of factorials:\n  \n  </p><ul><li>Factorials are calculated once and cached in memory so further\n    recalculation is fast.\n\n   </li><li>There is a limit to the size of factorials that gets cached in memory.\n    Currently this limit is .  Numbers larger than this\n    will not be cached, but re-calculated on demand.\n\n   </li><li>When calculating a factorial within the caching limit, say,\n    , all of the factorials smaller than this will get\n    calculated and cached in memory.\n\n   </li><li>As of the 2017-04-04 release, calculations of huge factorials larger\n    than the cache limit  are now calculated by a <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=BinarySplittingFactorial.frink\">binary splitting\n     algorithm</a> which makes them significantly faster on Java 1.8 and later.\n    (Did you know that Java 1.8's BigInteger calculations got drastically\n    faster because Frink's internal algorithms were contributed to it?)\n\n   </li><li>As of the 2017-04-04 release, functions that calculate binomial\n     coefficients like  are more efficient\n     because of the use of <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=BinarySplittingFactorial.frink\">binary\n     splitting algorithms,</a> especially for large numbers.\n\n     <p> is of the number of ways\n        things can be chosen  at a time, with\n       order being unimportant.  This is sometimes called \"m choose n\" or \"m C\n       n\".  This is equivalent to  although\n       calculating that way \n       often leads to way-too-big numbers.  For example, <code>binomial[10000,\n         9998]</code> is equal to 49995000, but if you calculated it naively,\n       you'd have to calculate 10000! which is a 35660-digit number, and divide\n       it by another huge number, which could be inefficient and slow.\n     \n     </p></li></ul><p>\n   By default, all variables in Frink can contain any type.  Variable names\n   begin with any (Unicode) letter followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or\n   the underscore () character.\n  </p><p>\n   You do not need to declare variables before using them.  The variable will\n   be defined in the smallest containing scope.\n  </p><p>\n   To assign a value to a variable, use the  operator:\n  </p><p>  (assigns a single value)  (assigns an array)\n  </p><p>\n   Variables  be declared before they are used using the\n    keyword.  For example, to\n   declare a variable called :\n  </p><p>\n   This defines the variable t in the smallest containing scope and sets its\n   initial value to the special value .  You may also\n   specify an initial value:\n  </p><p>\n   When a variable is declared, you can constrain the type of values that it\n   can contain.  The constraints are checked at runtime.  If you try to set a\n   value that does not meet the constraints, a runtime error occurs.  For\n   example, to make sure that the variable  only contains values\n   with dimensions of time, you can declare it using the \n   keyword which defines constraints.\n  </p><p><code>var t is time = 10 seconds</code></p><p>\n   In this case, the initial value is necessary to ensure that \n   contains a value with dimensions of time .  (The\n   special value  is applied if no initial value is\n   supplied.)  If a valid initial value is not supplied, this will produce an\n   error at runtime.\n  </p><p>\n   Multiple constraints can be specified by placing them in square brackets.\n    constraints must be met.  (If you want to do an \"OR\" of\n   constraints, see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ConstraintFunctions\">Constraint\n    Functions</a> section below.)\n  </p><p><code>var t is [time, positive] = 10 seconds</code></p><p>\n   Built-in constraint types include all of the dimension types defined in\n   your program.  For example, you can list all of the defined dimension types\n   (<code>length, mass, power, energy</code>) with the\n    or the \n   functions.  All of these defined types can be used as constraints.\n  </p><p>\n   The following built-in constraints can be used to verify that the value is\n   of one of the built-in types.  For example,\n  </p><p><code>var name is string = \"Frink\"</code></p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Built-in Constraint Types\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Value must be a boolean value\n       or  (and not just\n      a type that can be coerced to boolean; see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Truth\">Truth</a> section.)\n    </td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Value must be a <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#DataLibraries\">unit of measure</a> of any type (including\n      dimensionless numbers).

If, for example, you've\n   defined a class called , the following will work.\n  </p><p><code>a is Sphere = new Sphere[]</code></p><p>\n   This constraint check also works with interface names.  If the name of the\n   constraint is the name of an interface, this check will ensure that any\n   object assigned to the variable implements that interface.  See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=interfacetest.frink\">interfacetest.frink</a> file for an example.\n  </p><p>\n   You may define your own functions that will be used as constraints.  The\n   function must take one argument and return a  value if the\n   constraint is met.  Returning  or another value will\n   cause the constraint to fail.  The following defines a function called\n    that returns  if a value is a\n   positive dimensionless value.\n  </p><p>\n   You can test to see if a variable is defined using the following functions:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Variable Testing Functions\"><tbody><tr><td>Returns true if the symbol is\n      defined either as a local variable in the current scope (i.e. with the\n       operator), or as a unit (i.e. with the \n      operator.)\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Returns true if the\n      symbol is defined as a local variable in the current scope (i.e. with the\n       operator).\n  </td></tr></tbody></table><p>\n   Both functions can be called either with a raw variable name or with a\n   string.  For example:\n  </p><p><code>\n    isVariableDefined[a]\n    isVariableDefined[\"a\"]\n   </code></p><p>\n   Ha ha...just kidding.  There are no global variables in Frink.  However, if\n   you need to access some sort of \"global\" values from anywhere in your\n   program, without passing them explicitly to each function, you can simulate\n   it with class-level variables in a class that you define.  These are\n   defined using the  keywords, and are similar to\n    class-level variables in languages like C++ and Java.\n  </p><p>\n   If you want to use a \"global\" variable in only a few functions, you can\n   encapsulate those functions into a .\n  </p><p>\n   For samples of class-level variables and how to access them, see <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=classtest.frink\">classtest.frink</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   For internationalization, Frink allows <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/\">Unicode</a> characters anywhere.  For\n   maximum portability, and maximum editability with non-Unicode-aware\n   editors, you can use Unicode escapes to embed these characters in program\n   files.\n\n  </p><p>\n   Variable names can contain Unicode characters, indicated by\n    followed by exactly 4 hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F]\n   indicating the Unicode code-point, for example:  .  In\n   addition, a Unicode character can be specified with anywhere from one to\n   six hexadecimal digits by placing the digits in brackets, for example:\n    or  (this is the Unicode\n   character \"GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES\".  So, yes, you can have\n   kitty faces as variable names!)  This allows Unicode characters to be\n   placed into any ASCII text file, and edited by programs that don't\n   understand Unicode.  It also allows  Unicode character to be\n   used in an identifier.\n  </p><p>\n   If you  have a nifty editor that handles Unicode, or other\n   character encodings, you can write your Frink program in full Unicode, and\n   load it using the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#CommandLineOptions\"></a> command-line switch.  Keep in mind that in this\n   case, identifiers can only consist of Unicode letters, digits, \"other\n   symbols\" and the underscore.  You still have to use the \n   Unicode escape trick if your identifier contains other classes of\n   characters.\n  </p><p>\n   For example, Unicode defines the character  for Planck's\n   constant.  In the data file, we define Planck's constant as the normal\n   character  (which is easier to type) and also as the Unicode\n   character.  These definitions look like:\n  </p><p> The  notation simply defines a\n    unit, that is available from all functions.\n  </p><p>\n   By default, units are displayed with their dimensions given as multiples of\n   the\n   <a href=\"http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html\">International System\n    of Units (SI)</a> base units.  These are often not very intuitive.  For\n   example, volts are displayed as:\n  </p><p><code>1 m^2 s^-3 kg A^-1 (electric_potential)</code></p><p>\n   Of course, you could convert to volts explicitly using the\n    operator, but if you have to do that repeatedly, it's a\n   hassle.  Instead, you can define the default output format for a unit type\n   by using the  operator:\n  </p><p><code>electric_potential :-&gt; \"volts\"</code></p><p>\n   The left-hand side is the dimension list identifier like\n    or  or \n   (you can see what this is named for any given unit by entering an\n   expression of that type--see the first \"volt\" sample above.)\n  </p><p>\n   The right-hand side is any expression that can go on the right-hand-side of\n   a conversion operator  , including multiple conversions:\n  </p><p><code>time :-&gt; [0, \"days\", \"hours\", \"minutes\", \"seconds\"]</code><code>365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9.5400288 seconds</code><code>23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0899984 seconds</code></p><p>\n   The right-hand-side can even be a function that takes a single argument:\n  </p><p><code>HMS[x] := x -&gt; [0, \"hours\", \"minutes\", \"seconds\"]</code></p><p>\n   If you want, you can define a function that displays distances in\n   millimeters if it's small, kilometers if it's bigger, and light-years if\n   it's huge.\n  </p><p>\n   Floating-point calculations are performed to a limited number of digits.\n   You can change the number of digits of working precision by the\n    function:\n  </p><p><code>0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333</code></p><p>\n   Note that this will only affect calculations performed  this\n   flag is set, of course.  Currently, not all operations (notably\n   trigonometric functions) can be performed to arbitrary precision.\n  </p><p>\n   You can also see the current working precision by calling the\n    function:\n  </p><p>\n   By default, floating-point numbers are displayed in scientific notation\n   with one digit before the decimal point.  This can be changed to\n   \"engineering\" format where 1 to 3 digits are placed before the decimal\n   point and the exponent is a multiple of 3.  This allows you to more easily\n   see it as \"milli-\", \"micro-\", \"million\", etc.  The call to enable this is:\n  </p><p>\n   Example without engineering mode:\n  </p><p><code>1.405000000e+8 m (length)</code></p><p>\n   Now notice the change if you set \"engineering mode\" to true.  The result\n   comes out so you can more easily read it as \"140.5 million meters\":\n\n  </p><p><code>140.5000000e+6 m (length)</code></p><p>\n   In addition, rational numbers are, by default, displayed with a\n   floating-point approximation to their values:\n  </p><p><code>1/3 (approx. 0.3333333333333333)</code></p><p>\n   This behavior can be suppressed by calling\n   <code>showApproximations[]</code>.\n  </p><p><code>showApproximations[]</code></p><p>\n   You can tell Frink to always  rational numbers as\n   floating-point approximations by calling\n   .  The numbers will still continue to be\n   represented internally as rational numbers.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink tries to produce a human-readable description of units of measure,\n   such as \"power\" or \"energy\" or \"temperature\":\n  </p><p>\n   This suggestion can be suppressed by calling\n   </p><p>\n   Frink allows C/C++/Java-style comments:\n  </p><p>\n   If you repeat a calculation, you may want to define it as a function.\n   Functions in Frink are denoted by the function name followed by arguments\n   in square brackets, separated by commas.  A function can be defined like\n   the following:\n  </p><p><code>circlearea[radius] := pi radius^2</code></p><p>\n   Then, to call the function, say, to find the area of my telescope mirror,\n   which has a radius of 2 inches:\n  </p><p><code>0.008107319665559965 m^2 (area)</code></p><p>\n   But that comes out in standard units... let's try again, converting to\n   square inches.\n  </p><p><code>circlearea[2 inches] -&gt; in^2</code></p><p>\n   You may define multiple functions with the same name but different number\n   of arguments.\n  </p><p>\n   Multi-line functions can be built; just put the body in curly braces.  It\n   may be more legible to use the  statement in your\n   function.  For example, the factorial function could be written as:\n  </p><p><code>\n   factorial[x] :=\n   {\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return x * factorial[x-1]\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1</code></p><p>\n   If a function does not explicitly return a value, the value returned is the\n   value of the last expression evaluated.  A  statement\n   with no value on the right-hand-side returns a special void type.\n  </p><p>\n   Function declarations can have default values.  Default values are\n   specified by putting \"\" after a parameter name\n   in the function declaration.  For example, if your Willard pocket organizer\n   goes out, you can use Frink to calculate the tip on your dinner check, and,\n   to make it easy, you can default the tip rate to 15 percent of the bill.\n   The function declaration with default parameters is:\n  </p><p><code>tip[amount, rate=15 percent] := amount * rate</code></p><p>\n   Now, when you get to the restaurant, you can easily calculate the tip using\n   the default rate:\n  </p><p><code>12.1125 dollar (currency)</code></p><p>\n   Or, if service is outstanding and you want to tip at 20%, you can specify\n   the second argument instead of leaving it at the default:\n  </p><p><code>tip[80.75 dollars, 20 percent]</code></p><p>\n   The previous tip example probably has you thinking, \"Well, it would be nice\n   if it calculated the total too!\"  I'm bad at math, also... that's why I'm\n   developing Frink.\n  </p><p>\n   In Frink, values surrounded by square brackets and separated by commas form\n   a list of values.  These lists can be returned from a function, assigned to\n   a variable, or whatever.  A better version of the above function would\n   be defined to return a list containing the tip  the total as a\n   list:\n  </p><p><code>tipandtotal[amount, rate=15 percent] := [amount * rate,\n   amount * (1+rate)]</code></p><p>\n   Note the square brackets on the right-hand-side of the definition.  Then, to\n   calculate the tip, it's as easy as before:\n  </p><p><code>tipandtotal[80.75 dollars]</code><code>[12.1125 dollar (currency), 92.8625 dollar (currency)]</code></p><p>\n   Yes indeedy-o, functions can be recursive.  The classic example is the\n   factorial:\n  </p><p><code>factorial[x] := x&gt;1  ?  x factorial[x-1]  :  1</code></p><p>\n   This uses the conditional expression <code>condition ? trueClause :\n    falseClause</code>.  The condition is first evaluated (it should evaluate\n   to a boolean value,) and if it's true, the true clause is evaluated and\n   returned, the false clause otherwise.  Let's try a big number, just big\n   enough that it would overflow my old solar calculator:\n  </p><p><code>119785716699698917960727837216890987364589381425464258\n    57555362864628009582789845319680000000000000000</code></p><p>\n   You can still blow out the stack if you go too deep, or forget to put in a\n   condition such that the function terminates.  Don't come crying to me.\n  </p><p>\n   Like other variables, formal arguments to functions can have constraints.\n   The syntax for constraining is just the same as setting <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ConstraintsOnVariables\">Constraints on variables.</a>  For example,\n   if you want to make sure that a function that calculates the volume of a\n   sphere is passed a radius, the declaration looks like:\n  </p><p><code>sphereVolume[radius is length] := 4/3 pi radius^3</code></p><p>\n   The constraint(s) are checked at runtime, and if all constraints are not\n   met, the function call produces an error.\n  </p><p>\n   At some point in the future, I'd like to have this choose an appropriate\n   function based on the constraints, if more than one is possible.  My\n   underlying function dispatching is designed to allow this, but functions\n   with constraints may be slower to resolve.\n  </p><p>\n   You can control program flow with the if/then/else construct.  If the\n   condition is true, it will execute the first clause, otherwise, if there is\n   an (optional)  clause, it will execute the\n    clause.\n  </p><p><code>\n    if a&lt;10\n    {\n    } else\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Greater than ten.\"]</code></p><p> Note that putting the brackets and statements on separate\n   lines is currently important.  Also, please note that the \n   keyword goes on the same line as the closing bracket of the\n    clause.\n  </p><p>\n   If either the  or  clause is a single\n   line, the curly braces for that clause can be eliminated.  The following is\n   the same as the code above:\n  </p><p><code>\n    if a&lt;10\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Less than ten\"]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Greater than ten.\"]</code></p><p>\n   The condition must be able to be turned into a boolean value.  When testing\n   for equality, be sure to use the double equals sign, (a single equals\n   indicates assignment) :\n  </p><p>\n   If, for some reason, you need to jam everything into one line, you need to\n   add the  keyword:\n  </p><p><code>\n    if a==b then println[\"Equal.\"] else println[\"Not equal.\"]\n   </code></p><p>\n   Alternatively, there is a conditional operator (sometimes called the\n   \"ternary operator\") that can be placed inside an expression.\n  </p><p><code> ?  : </code></p><p>\n   If  evaluates to , then the result\n   is , otherwise the result\n   is .\n  </p><p>\n   The ternary conditional operator can be used in any expression:\n  </p><p><code>\n    println[\"I have $numCats \" + ( numCats == 1 ? \"cat\" : \"cats\" ) + \".\"]\n   </code></p><p>\n   The condition in an if/then/else statement or a loop needs to be a boolean\n   (true/false) value.  This can either be represented by the special values\n    and , or the following types can be\n   used in places where a boolean value is required:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Boolean-Equivalent Expressions\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Any list (even a zero-element list)</td></tr><tr><td>The special undefined value </td></tr></tbody></table><p>\n   Any other value will cause a runtime error.

For example, the\n   following creates in effect 8 nested loops, each running from 1 to 2.  The\n   results are assigned as an array to the variable .\n  </p><p><code>\n    upper = 2\n    bounds = makeArray[[8], new range[1,upper]]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[d]\n   </code></p><p>\n   As of the 2012-09-04 release, the bounds of one loop can now depend on the\n   bounds of the loops to its left, for example:\n  </p><p><code>\n    multifor [f,g] = [new range[1,3], new range[f+1,3]]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"$f $g\"]\n   </code></p><p>\n   You can use the  statement to prematurely jump to the next\n   iteration of a  loop.

See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ForLoop\">for loop</a> section for an\n   example.\n  </p><p>\n   There's a version of the  statement that jumps to a\n   specified level of a  loop.  The leftmost/highest\n   level is level 0, and the next levels increment to the right.  The loop\n   must be labeled and the index to jump to follows the label in the\n    statement.  For example </p><p>\n   A Gray code is a sequence in which only one element of the sequence changes\n   at a time.  The best-known Gray code is called the \"binary reflected Gray\n   code\" but a large number of different Gray codes are possible.  You can\n   iterate through finite and infinite Gray code sequences using\n   the  function.\n  </p><p><b>Finite-length (n, k) Gray Code</b>:  An (n, k) Gray Code is a Gray code\n   with  states per element and  elements.  For\n   example, the typical binary reflected Gray code is a (2, k) code.  This is\n   generated by calling \n   where  and  are integers.  For example to\n   generate a binary Gray code with 3 digits:\n  </p><p><code>\n    for c = grayCode[2, 3]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[c]</code><code>\n    [0, 0, 0]\n    [0, 0, 1]\n    [0, 1, 0]\n    [1, 1, 1]\n    [1, 0, 0]</code></p><p><b>Finite-length Gray Code with arbitrary states</b>:  You can generate a\n   finite-length Gray code where each element can have an arbitrary set of\n   states, specified as an array of arrays:\n  </p><p><code>\n    args = [ [\"A\", \"B\"], [1, 3, 5] ]\n    for c = grayCode[args]</code><code>\n    [A, 1]\n    [A, 3]\n    [B, 5]\n    [B, 1]</code></p><p><b>Infinite-length Gray Code</b>:  You can generate a\n   infinite-length Gray code where each element has the same number of\n   states.  This is different from the other Gray code examples because the\n   least-significant element is returned as element 0 in the array, which gets\n   longer as more elements are needed.  For example, to generate a binary\n   reflected Gray code, use :\n  </p><p><code>\n    for c = grayCode[2]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[c]</code><code>\n    [0]\n    [1]\n    [0, 1]\n    [1, 1, 1]\n    [0, 0, 1]\n    [1, 0, 1, 1]\n    [0, 1, 1, 1]</code></p><p>\n   Frink can evaluate a string as a Frink expression.  If that means something\n   to you, good.  It's cool.  You can make programs that write and run their\n   own programs.

Creating an\n   array with the  methods does  prevent\n   arrays from being extended nor prevent them from becoming non-rectangular.\n   It is  necessary to pre-allocate a one-dimensional array of a\n   specific size, as all arrays will automatically resize on assignment.\n  </p><p>\n   If  is a function (it can be\n   an <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#AnonymousFunctions\">Anonymous Function</a>), then that\n   function is called to provide the value for each cell.  The function must\n   have the same number of arguments as the dimensions of the array, and it is\n   passed the indices of the cell.  For example, element [0,0] of the array\n   will be passed the arguments [0,0].\n  </p><p>\n   The following makes a cell with each value initialized to twice its index.\n  </p><p><code>makeArray[[10], {|x| 2x}]</code><code>[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]</code></p><p>\n   A two-dimensional array requires a function with 2 arguments.

For example, the following\n   creates a \"diagonal\" matrix with the specified values passed in as an array\n   as the diagonal entries:\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [1,2,3]\n    d = length[array]<p>\n    m = makeArray[[d,d], {|a,b,data| a==b ? data@a : 0}, array]</p></code><code>[[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]]</code></p><p>It is very important to note that arrays are normally passed by\n   reference.

(These are the values\n   returned by\n   the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ThreeWayComparison\">three-way\n   comparison</a> operator, so you may be able to use it in your comparison\n   function.)\n  </p><p>\n   For example, if you want to use an ordering that simply sorts shorter\n   strings before longer strings, (say that six times speedily,) you can do the\n   following:\n  </p><p><code>\n    f = { |a,b|&nbsp;&nbsp;length[a] &lt;=&gt; length[b] }\n    x.insert[\"aa\"]\n    x.insert[\"z\"]</code></p><p>\n   An OrderedList can also take a piece of arbitrary data that is passed to\n   the comparison function.  This data is passed as the second argument to the\n   constructor.  If the first argument to the constructor is\n   , the default orderer will be used.  The data will be\n   passed as a third argument to the comparison function.\n  </p><p><code>\n    f = { |a,b,data|&nbsp;&nbsp;(abs[a-data] &lt;=&gt; abs[b-data]}<p>\n    x = new OrderedList[f, 3] </p>\n    x.insert[1]\n    x.insert[3]\n    x</code></p><p>\n   Since  extends , <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ArrayMethods\">array methods</a> are available on OrderedList unless\n   they would interfere with preserving ordering.

Lines can be read one at a time,\n   <em>and have trailing carriage returns/linefeeds removed.</em>  On\n   end-of-file (EOF), the input function returns the special value\n   .  A short-program to read from standard in and echo its\n   output may look like:\n  </p><p><code>while (line = input[\"\"]) != undef\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[line]\n   </code></p><p>\n   If, for some reason, you're in a GUI mode and you still want to read from\n   standard input, you can call  to read one line\n   from standard input.  This is just like calling  from\n   command-line mode, which is what you really want to be calling if you're\n   trying to make programs that work both interactively and non-interactively,\n   and in GUI mode and non-GUI mode.  But if you're sure you only ever want to\n   read from standard input, and don't want to trigger a GUI input window, use\n   </p><p><code>while (line = readStdin[]) != undef\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[line]\n   </code></p><p>\n   If you want to request multiple input items from the user, you can use the\n   \"multi-input\" version of the input function, where the second argument is an\n   array of items you're going to prompt for:\n  </p><p><code>[first, last] = input[\"What is your name\", [\"First Name\", \"Last Name\"]]</code></p><p>\n   This will produce a graphical user interface which prompts the user for\n   their input.  This works on AWT, Swing, Android, and in text mode if you're\n   running in a pure text environment.\n  </p><p>\n   The results will be returned as an array of strings, in the same order as\n   they were specified.

The\n    loop exits when the user cancels calculations.  Previous\n   results are displayed to the user at the top of the input dialog, and the\n   user's previous input is maintained (verbatim) in the input fields.\n  </p><p><code>\n    n = \"10000\"\n    r = \"2\"<p>\n    message = \"Find roots of a number\"</p>\n    while&nbsp;[n,&nbsp;r]&nbsp;=&nbsp;results&nbsp;=&nbsp;input[message,&nbsp;[[\"Number\",&nbsp;n],&nbsp;[\"Root\",&nbsp;r]]]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[num, root] = eval[results]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;val = num^(1/root)<p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message = \"$n^(1/$r) = $val\"</p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[message]</code></p><p>\n   This code works whether the user is running with a Swing or AWT or Android\n   GUI, or in text mode.  The user cancels input by closing the input dialog\n   (in Swing or AWT), hitting the \"back\" button on Android, or with\n   end-of-file (EOF) in text mode (EOF can be simulated by Control-D on\n   Unixlike systems, Control-Z on Windows.)\n  </p><p>\n   Note that the idiomatic use of the \"eval\" function to turn the string\n   inputs into Frink expressions.

For example, hexadecimal uses the first 16 characters of\n   this, .  However, it's not as clear when you\n   go beyond base 36 what characters should be used.  You can declare a custom\n   \"alphabet\" of any size to be used in base conversions.\n  </p><p>\n   For example, Bitcoin addresses use a base-58 alphabet consisting of the\n   characters:\n  </p><p><code>\"123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\"</code></p><p>\n   Note that this alphabet does not include  (zero),\n    (uppercase o),  (uppercase i), \n   (lowercase L), as those are indistinguishable in some fonts.\n  </p><p>\n   To convert a number to a string using this alphabet, you can use the\n    function where\n    is a string which contains the character for the\n   \"zero\" position first.  The radix will be equal to the number of characters\n   in the alphabet string.  (In the below example, base 58.)  The following\n   turns a numeric value into a Bitcoin address string:\n  </p><p><code>alphabet&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    number = 0x00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F6</code><code>6UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM</code></p><p>\n   (Note that this alphabet does not have a zero as the first character (it\n   has a 1,) so if you need to pad it to a certain length, you need to pad\n   with the first character in the alphabet.)\n  </p><p>\n   Conversely, you can parse an integer with a custom alphabet by using the\n    function, which takes\n   the same format for its alphabet string.  The example below parses a\n   Bitcoin address.\n  </p><p><code>alphabet&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    str = \"6UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM\"</code><code>25420294593250030202636073700053352635053786165627414518</code></p><p>\n   (Note that the number obtained above is the decimal equivalent of the\n   Bitcoin address encoded above; it could instead be formatted in hexadecimal\n   or other formats.)\n  </p><p>\n   The strings are allowed to contain any Unicode characters.  If you attempt\n   to parse a string that contains characters outside your alphabet, the\n   special value  will be returned.\n  </p><p>\n   This section demonstrates some custom base conversions.\n  </p><p>\n   Devanagari digits are used in Hindi and Sanskrit, and occur in the Unicode\n   standard from  (zero) through \n   (nine).

If you want\n   to typeset a string of numbers as superscripts on a Unicode-aware system,\n   you can do something like this:\n  </p><p><code>supAlphabet&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"\\u2070\\u00b9\\u00b2\\u00b3\" + char[0x2074 to 0x2079]\n    \"10\" + base[23, supAlphabet]</code></p><p>\n   Or, conversely, to parse a stream of these superscript numerals as a single\n   number:\n  </p><p><code>supAlphabet&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"\\u2070\\u00b9\\u00b2\\u00b3\" + char[0x2074 to 0x2079]\n    parseInt[\"²³\", supAlphabet]</code></p><p>: Note that almost all fonts make Unicode superscript\n   numbers look different and not line up.

Newlines are allowed and retained in the string. Hopefully,\n   this is less burdensome and error-prone than Perl's \"here-document\" syntax.\n   For example:\n  </p><p><code>\n    lyrics = \"\"\"Oh, Danny Boy,\n    The pipes, the pipes are calling<p>\n    From glen to glen and down the mountainside\"\"\"</p></code></p><p>\n   This is also useful when you have strings that contain double quotes, as it\n   eliminates the need for escaping those quotes:\n  </p><p><code>quote = \"\"\"We will say \"ni\" to you again if you do not appease us.\"\"\"</code></p><p>\n   If a double-quoted string or multi-line string contains a dollar sign\n   () followed by a variable name (which must begin with a\n   letter), the value of that variable is replaced in the string at evaluation\n   time.  This is (probably) faster than string concatenation which could be\n   used to get the same effect.  There are certain optimizations to make sure\n   that this isn't significantly more inefficient if the string doesn't need\n   replacement.  (The string is checked for dollar signs at compile time.)\n  </p><p><code>first = \"Inigo\"\n    last = \"Montoya\"<p>\n    \"My name is $first $last.\"</p></code><code>My name is Inigo Montoya.</code></p><p>\n   If you need to explicitly mark where the variable name begins and ends, you\n   can put it in curly braces as below:\n  </p><p><code>last=\"Frink\"\n    \"You can call me the ${last}meister.\"</code><code>You can call me the Frinkmeister.</code></p><p>\n   Since a variable name must begin with a letter, it's fine to put a quantity\n   like  into the string, and no substitution will be\n   attempted, and there will be no runtime performance penalty.  To put a\n   literal dollar sign into the string immediately preceding an letter\n   character, use two dollar signs:\n  </p><p><code>\"I want my $$USD 2.00.  Plus tip.\"</code><code>I want my $USD 2.00.  Plus tip.</code></p><p>\n   For best performance,  use double dollar signs like this\n   unless they directly precede an letter character.\n  </p><p>\n   You can always use this technique to coerce a numeric value, or a unit, or\n   a date, etc., to a string representation by enclosing it in quotes:\n  </p><p><code>n = 2^13367-1\n   stringRep = \"$n\"</code></p><p>\n   After the above code, the variable  contains the\n   result of the calculation  which you can use to grab\n   certain characters, truncate, etc. Note that the\n    function does the same thing, and can\n   often be used on the same line.\n  </p><p> This feature requires connection to the\n   internet.  If you are using Frink on a handheld device, you may incur\n   connection charges.  Also, since I cannot guarantee the availability of any\n   internet sites, this feature is intended only as a bonus that may not work\n   reliably if at all.

Date literals are surrounded by pound signs ()\n   and can be entered in a wide variety of formats, but I prefer a format like:\n  </p><p>\n   Note that I've chosen to have most-significant digits first, as is only\n   logical (the world will realize this someday.) You can have whitespace\n   preceding or following the # signs for readability.

If the\n   format you want is not there, see below for ways to define your own\n   formats.\n  </p><p>\n   You can also parse a string into a date using the\n    function.  This returns the string\n   parsed into a date/time datatype, or returns  if the\n   string cannot be parsed as a date using any of the defined date formats.\n  </p><p>\n   All date/time formats also allow a timezone specifier at the end.  This\n   timezone specifier can be a 3-letter code like \"UTC\" or \"MST\", but you can\n   also use the name of a country or U.S. state (if the country or state has a\n   single time zone) or a selected city (of course, not all cities are\n   available.)  This means that you don't have to know when daylight savings\n   time starts and ends.  The names are chosen from the globally-used Olson\n   timezone database, and Frink allows shortening of the Olson timezones, say,\n   from \"Europe/Paris\" to simply \"Paris\".  The following are all valid inputs:\n  </p><p><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM New York #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Colorado #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM US/Mountain #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Eastern #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Hawaii #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM America/New_York #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM France #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Paris #</code><code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM Europe/Paris #</code></p><p>\n   If you do  specify a timezone, the timezone used will be the\n   timezone obtained from your Java Virtual Machine (which is probably the\n   timezone set on  computer.)\n  </p><p>\n   While the Olson timezone database is very complete, and has named rules for\n   basically all official timezones in the world, sometimes your data source\n   only tells you the offset from UTC or GMT, or may even have custom offsets\n   in minutes.  If this is the case, the timezone offset from UTC can be\n   specified in one of the following formats:\n  </p><ul></ul><p>\n   (Please note that, due to the plus and minus symbols, these timezone\n   specification must be in double quotes on the right-hand-side of\n   the  operator:)\n  </p><p><code># August 25, 2019 16:00 # -&gt; \"GMT+07:00\"</code></p><p>\n   So, for example, if your data source is in the ISO-8601 format that doesn't\n   allow you to use named timezones (it only allows only numbered timezones or\n   the letter ) and looks like:\n  </p><p><code>2014-06-02T02:24:10-06:00</code></p><p>\n   Then Frink will parse the trailing  as a timezone\n   specification.  (Again, see all the date formats that Frink parses by\n   default in the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkdata/dateformats.txt\"></a> file.)\n  </p><p>\n   The trailing  (for \"Zulu time\", an alias for UTC,) in the\n   following ISO-8601 format indicates that the time is in UTC.\n  </p><p> The Olson timezone database and the POSIX standard (and the\n   Java Virtual Machine) define timezones called something like\n    (or, using Frink's shorter notation,\n   ), but you must be  that the\n   sign convention of these zones is  of what any rational\n   person would choose, and  of the other sign conventions in\n   Frink!  In the Olson/POSIX/Java world,  is actually 7\n   hours  of GMT.  Yes, in that weird world,\n    means GMT  seven hours.  Augh.  (And you\n   wonder why all of my documentation is full of diatribes against the\n   stupidity of almost every major standard.)\n  </p><p>\n   This is a horrible, insane convention and it  bite you or the\n   people you try to communicate with (unless you both accidentally share the\n   same random form of insanity and wrongness.)  They will think you are crazy\n   if you follow this convention.  Yet it's the convention used by a large\n   fraction of the world's software, so Frink keeps these timezones around\n   (for now) in case you have to communicate with other software that uses the\n   insane Olson/POSIX conventions.  But  use these conventions\n   otherwise.\n  </p><p>\n   The 4-digit timezone formats listed in the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#CustomTimezones\">Custom Timezones</a> section above use correct and\n   rational definitions of these sign conventions.  If you are using custom\n   timezones, you are most strongly warned to use the 4-digit versions like\n    or .  These will be correct.\n    will mean GMT  2 hours.  But don't\n   confuse these 4-digit versions with the shorter 1- or 2-digit\n   Olson/POSIX/Java versions like  or  or\n    which should be considered weird and wrong (unless\n   you're communicating with a source that produces these timezone names\n   according to the weird and wrong Olson/POSIX/Java rules.  For now, Frink\n   will let you use those weird conventions, but it will scowl and furrow its\n   brow at you and someday in the future it may not allow them at all.  I might\n   completely disallow the shorter versions of these timezone names\n   ( reject  while still allowing the more\n   foolhardy )\n  </p><p>\n   The function  will return an enumeration of all\n   known time zone names.\n  </p><p>\n   Please note that your Java implementation may not\n   have all of the timezones named in these examples.

You can also convert to another time format by specifying\n   it after the arrow operator.  \"JD\" for Julian Day, \"JDE\" for Julian Day\n   (Ephemeris) referenced to Dynamical Time, \"MJD\" for Modified\n   Julian Day are supported, as well as finding the times in selected\n   timezones, cities and countries:\n  </p><p>Example:  predicted \n   that the peak of this year's Perseid meteor shower might be around August\n   12, 2001 at 0400 UTC:\n  </p><p>Converting to local time (the default behavior:)<code>AD 2001-08-11 10:00:00.000 PM (Sat) Mountain Daylight Time</code></p><p>Converting to another time zone:<code># 2001-08-12 04:00 UTC # -&gt; Japan</code><code>AD 2001-08-12 01:00:00.000 PM (Sun) Japan Standard Time</code></p><p>\n   Current time in Germany:<code>AD 2001-12-28 07:20:01.508 AM (Fri) Central European Time</code></p><p>\n   Current time in another state that just has a single timezone:<code>AD 2010-12-28 07:20:01.508 AM (Fri) Hawaii Standard Time</code></p><p>\n   Current Julian Day:</p><p>\n   Current Julian Day Ephemeris:</p><p>\n   Convert Julian Day Ephemeris to a date:<code>AD 2000-01-01 04:58:56.170 AM (Sat) Mountain Standard Time</code></p><p>\n   Actually, since 2003-06-12, Frink uses full precision (usually rational\n   numbers) when storing dates, so the Julian day may come out as a rational\n   number like:\n  </p><p><code>JD 211924042672877/86400000 (approx. 2452824.5679731136)</code></p><p>\n   If you don't desire this much precision, you can use the\n    or  function and\n   divide by  to get the Julian date as a\n   floating-point number, not a string or a rational number:\n  </p><p>\n   You can subtract one date from another, or add/subtract a time interval to\n   a date.  So, if I wanted to find out when I was 1 billion seconds old, I\n   add it to my birthdate:\n  </p><p><code>#1969-08-19 16:54 Mountain# + 1 billion seconds</code><code>AD 2001-04-27 06:40:40.000 PM (Fri) Mountain Daylight Time</code></p><p>\n   That was pretty recently.

Perhaps later there\n   will be \"increment/decrement\" of these individual fields on Date objects,\n   but it's better to make sure that you understand these are \n   inherently troublesome and often meaningless operations.  ( what\n   does it mean to increment the month on a date representing Jan. 31?)  Use\n   fixed-size units if you can.\n  </p><p>\n   You can subtract one date from another, and receive an answer as a Unit\n   with dimensions of time (that you can convert to any scale you\n   want... you're used to this by now.)  For example, if you want to know how\n   many days until Christmas:\n  </p><p><code>#2002-12-25# - now[] -&gt; days</code></p><p>\n   (Try inverting the above calculation to see exactly when I wrote this!)\n  </p><p>\n   Note that these calculations do not take leap seconds into account by\n   default.  If you want these calculations to take leap seconds into account,\n   see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#LeapSeconds\">Leap Seconds</a> section of the\n   documentation.\n  </p><p>\n   The human-defined Gregorian (and Julian) calendars are full of weirdnesses\n   and inconsistencies.\n  </p><p>\n   However, sometimes you still need to iterate through these varying-length\n   units.  Frink gives a variety of functions to manipulate calendar dates.\n   The functions are intentionally chosen to be functions that make sense, and\n   Frink tries to avoid providing functions that don't make sense (for\n   example, some date/time libraries let you take a date like January 31, 2019\n   and increment the month field.  Since there is no Feburary 31, the results\n   simply don't and can't make any sense.)\n  </p><p>\n   Note that these functions will sometimes produce surprising (but\n   consistent) results!  Years and months are of varying length.  Some years\n   are longer than others by a day (because of leap days.)  Some years are\n   longer than others by a second (because of leap seconds).  Some days or\n   months are longer or shorter than others depending on your Daylight Saving\n   / Summer Time rules!  For example, in the \"US/Mountain\" timezone, the month\n   of March, 2019 is only 30 days, 23 hours long, not 31 days!  Similarly,\n   November, 2019 is 31 days, 1 hour long!  In another timezone, it may be\n   exactly 31 days!  Some days are 25 hours long, while others are 23 hours\n   long!

The following\n   functions add and subtract dates, taking leap seconds into account:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Leap Second Functions\"><tbody><tr><td>Adds the\n      specified offset (given as a time) to the specified date, taking leap\n      seconds into account.

Note that\n   the exact second of the resultant date/time value is undefined on the leap\n   second boundary (which this calculation includes.)  Frink does \n   represent the leap second as something like .\n  </p><p>\n   Modern leap seconds were first introduced on\n   1972 January 1, where the value of TAI-UTC became exactly 10 seconds, and\n   leap seconds have been introduced at irregular intervals since then.  Leap\n   seconds may be added just before January 1 or July 1 of each year.\n  </p><p>\n   It should be noted that from 1961 January 1 to 1972 January 1, instead of\n   introducing discrete leap seconds, you had to do linear interpolation to\n   convert between TAI and UTC.  <i>Be warned that Frink follows this\n   interpolation process between these dates, and the value of UTC-TAI will\n   not be an integer during this period!</i> Before 1961 Jan 1, this function\n   returns 0 seconds.  For dates after the last known leap second is\n   introduced, this function will return the value of TAI-UTC for the\n   last-published leap second ( 37 seconds after 2017-01-01.)\n  </p><p>\n   The  timezone specifier can be used to convert to/from\n   International Atomic Time:\n  </p><p>\n   Converting a UTC time to TAI:\n  </p><p><code>\n    d1 = # 2017-11-01 00:00 UTC #\n    d1 -&gt; TAI</code><code>AD 2017-11-01 AM 12:00:37.000 (Wed) International Atomic Time</code></p><p>\n   Converting a TAI time to UTC:\n  </p><p><code>\n    d2 = # 2017-11-01 00:00 TAI #\n    d2 -&gt; UTC</code><code>AD 2017-10-31 PM 11:59:23.000 (Tue) Coordinated Universal Time</code></p><p>Additional conversions between time systems can be performed using the\n   following relations:\n  </p><ul><li><b>Terrestrial Time/Dynamical Time:</b> TT = TAI + 32.184 seconds\n    <i>(Terrestrial Time is a more modern name for Dynamical Time.

Frink\n   matches most all of the regular expressions matched by Perl, and most\n   regular expressions are portable between languages like Perl, Ruby, Python,\n   Frink, etc.  Frink internally uses the OROMatcher regular expression\n   library, which attempts to match as much of Perl 5's syntax as possible.\n  </p><p>\n   If a pattern matches, it returns an array (possibly empty) of all of the\n   \"saved\" matches inside parentheses.  If a pattern does  match,\n   it returns the value .  Since any array (even an empty\n   named one) is treated as a  value, and \n   is treated as  (see the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Truth\">Truth</a>\n   section of the documentation,) this makes it easy to test within an\n    statement:\n  </p><p><code>\n   for line = lines[\"https://frinklang.org/\"]\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if [email] = line =~ %r/(\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+)/<p>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Matched email $email\"]\n   </p></code></p><p>\n   (Since a matched pattern always returns an array of values, putting\n    in square brackets assigns the result, as a single\n   string, to the variable named .  Without the brackets, it\n   would assign  to the variable .)\n  </p><p>\n   The matching syntax is similar to Perl or Ruby, with the exception that the\n   pattern is denoted by  as\n   below:\n  </p><p><code>\n   line = \"New Zealand\"\n   if line =~ %r/Alan/i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Matched\"]</code></p><p>\n   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the string.\n   If you need to build up a variable regular expression from a string, use\n   the  or  functions.  The sample below is identical to the\n   sample above:\n  </p><p><code>\n    line = \"New Zealand\"\n    re = regex[\"Alan\", \"i\"]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Matched\"]</code></p><p>\n   Any part of the pattern surrounded by parentheses are saved off and\n   returned as an  (even if only one item is returned.)  There\n   aren't shortcut ... variables like in Perl, and probably\n   never will be, as it's too easy to break code without knowing it.\n  </p><p>\n   The usual idiom is to get return values by breaking apart the array that is\n   returned:\n  </p><p><code>\n   line = \"My name is Inigo Montoya.\"<p>\n   if [first, last] = line =~ %r/my name is (\\w+) (\\w+)/i</p>\n   {<p>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"First name is: $first\"]</p>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Last  name is: $last\"]</code></p><p>\n   If you don't assign the results to an array in square brackets (even a\n   single-element array,) all matching results are assigned as an array to a\n   single variable:\n\n  </p><p><code>\n   line = \"My name is Inigo Montoya.\"<p>\n   results = line =~ %r/my name is (\\w+) (\\w+)/i</p>\n   if results\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"First name is: \" + results@0]<p>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Last  name is: \" + results@1]</p>\n   }\n   </code></p><p>\n   If the  modifier is used at the end of the pattern,\n   (indicating return  times matched, not just the first,) this\n   will return an <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expression</a> of the items matched, and you should\n   change the  statement to a  statement:\n  </p><p><code>\n   line = \"My name is Inigo Montoya.\"<p>\n   for [first, last] = line =~ %r/my name is (\\w+) (\\w+)/ig</p>\n   {<p>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"First name is: $first\"]</p>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"Last  name is: $last\"]</code></p><p>\n   See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IteratingMatches\">Iterating Matches</a> section of the\n    documentation below for more ways to handle this case.\n  </p><p>\n   This section is a quick tutorial on the parts that create a regular\n   expression.\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Basic Regular Expression patterns\"><tbody><tr><td>Matches the literal string </td></tr><tr><td>Matches the literal string  the literal string .\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Character class, matches any of the\n      characters  or  or  (once\n      only.)\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Character class (with range), matches any\n      uppercase character from A to Z inclusive.

For example, to change a file with names like\n   \"Frink, John\" to \"John Frink\":\n  </p><p><code>\n    line =~ %s/(\\w+), (\\w+)/$2 $1/\n   </code></p><p>\n   You can't use  and  outside of the pattern\n   match, like you can in Perl, though.  Another difference from Perl is that\n   the return value of a search-and-replace is the replaced string, and not\n   the number of times replaced.  This may change.\n  </p><p>\n   If the  modifier exists on a search-and-replace operation,\n   the right-hand-side of the substitution is treated as an expression.  The\n   values saved on the left-hand side in parentheses are put into the\n   variables  ,  , etc.  (<em>Note that these\n   variables are only available in the right-hand side of the\n   substitution!</em>)\n  </p><p>\n   The following sample increments every integer it finds in the line.\n  </p><p><code>\n    \"There are 3 lights.

The URL can be an HTTP,\n   file, or FTP URL.  It is best used with the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ForLoop\"></a> loop.

The following implements a simple \"echo\" program:\n  </p><p><code>\n    for line = lines[\"-\"]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[line]\n   </code></p><p>\n   Or, a simple program to read in and sort the lines from standard input, and\n   print them back out:\n  </p><p><code>\n    println[joinln[sort[lines[\"-\"]]]]\n   </code></p><p>\n   The argument to the function may also be a \n   or a  which simplifies reading from other input\n   streams (for example, reading from a  or an\n   external process, or a pipe.)

If you are not requesting an HTTP\n   URL, or the encoding is not properly specified, or not set in the HTTP\n   headers, these functions will use your system's default character encoding.\n   If the default charset is not appropriate for a file or URL, you can\n   explicitly specify the character encoding of the file using the\n   two-argument versions of the above functions:\n  </p><p><code>lines[,&nbsp;]\n    read[,&nbsp;]</code></p><p>\n   The encoding is a string representing any character encoding that your\n   version of Java supports, ,\n   , , ,\n   , .

Check the release notes for your Java implementation to\n   see if other charsets are supported.\n  </p><p>\n   In addition, see the sample program  \n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=encodings.frink\">encodings.frink</a> which\n   demonstrates how to list all of the encodings available on your system (and\n   their aliases.)\n  </p><p>\n   Text files can be written with the  class.

These\n   work just like functions with no name.  In fact, that's exactly what they\n   are.  The syntax is:\n  </p><p>\n    These can be multi-line functions, too:\n  </p><p><code>{ ||\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[x+y]\n    }</code></p><p>\n   The arguments in  are a (possibly empty)\n   comma-separated list of variable names which are treated just like the\n   formal parameters to a function.  The body is one or more statements or\n   expressions to be executed.\n  </p><p>\n   How is this useful?  Well, for example the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#select\"></a> function can take an anonymous\n   function as an argument to help it select items from a list.  See its\n   documentation for more information.\n  </p><p>\n   An anonymous function can be called as a function.  The current syntax looks\n   just like a function call:\n  </p><p><code>\n    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }\n    isEven[4]</code></p><p>\n   You can also apply an anonymous function with\n   the \n   function.   should be an array of arguments to the\n   function.\n  </p><p><code>\n    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }\n    apply[isEven, [4]]</code></p><p>\n   As of the 2025-02-08 release, an anonymous function can be declared and\n   immediately applied to its arguments by enclosing them in square brackets\n   after the declaration.\n  </p><p>\n   The following defines an anonymous function that\n   squares its argument and immediately applies it with the\n   argument .\n  </p><p>will sort lists in which the elements have\n   the same type.  When sorting units, the units should be conformal (that is,\n   all should have the same dimensions.)  It is important to note that the\n   list will be sorted in-place, that is, the original list will be modified!\n   To get around this, the array should first be copied with the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ArrayMethods\"> method.</a></p><p>  If you want to do language-correct sorting of strings,\n   especially for languages with accents, use the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#LexicalSorting\">Lexical Sorting</a> methods instead.  The default\n    is designed to be simple and fast, but does not sort\n   human languages according to their rules.\n  </p><p>\n   The two-argument version  allows\n   you to specify a user-defined comparison routine. The second argument is a\n   (possibly anonymous) function which contains a user-defined comparison\n   routine.  The comparison routine must take 2 arguments\n   (say ) and return -1 if a is less than b, 0 if a==b, and\n   1 if a is greater than b.  (These are the values returned by\n   the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ThreeWayComparison\">three-way comparison</a>\n   operator,  )  The argument  may also\n   be an .\n   The following samples are equivalent:\n  </p><p><code>\n    a = [5,2,3,1,4]\n    cmp = { |a,b|  a &lt;=&gt; b }</code></p><p>\n   The default sort is much faster than if you define a user-defined\n   comparison function (about 30 times faster in my tests!)  Now I see why\n   Perl has so many anomalous and special-cased optimizations around\n   user-defined sorting.\n  </p><p>\n   If the  function needs additional data to perform its\n   work, you can use the three-argument  function which requires a three-argument comparison\n   function to be passed to it, with the first two arguments being items to\n   compare and the third argument being the arbitrary data.  The\n   argument  may also be an .  For\n   example, to sort a list by a specified column number:\n  </p><p><code>\n    list = [[1, \"c\"], [2, \"b\"], [3, \"a\"]]\n     cmpfunc = {|a, b, column| a@column &lt;=&gt; b@column}\n     sort[list, cmpfunc, 1]</code></p><p>\n   If you always want to sort a multi-dimensional array by column number, you\n   can get an appropriate sorting function that sorts by a specified column by\n   calling  and passing that as a sorting\n   function.  The column number is zero-based.  For example, the following\n   simplifies the above example and sorts by column 1:\n  </p><p><code>\n    list = [[1, \"c\"], [2, \"b\"], [3, \"a\"]]\n    sort[list, byColumn[1]]</code></p><p>\n   If you need to sort by several columns (that is, if the first column\n   compares equal, then sort by column 2, etc, you can get an appropriate\n   sorting function by calling  and\n   passing that as a sorting function.  The column numbers are\n   an  and are zero-based.  For example, the following sorts by\n   column 0 and then by column 1.\n  </p><p><code>\n    list = [[1, \"c\"], [2, \"b\"], [1, \"a\"], [3, \"d\"]]\n    sort[list, byColumns[[0,1]]]</code><code>[[1, a], [1, c], [2, b], [3, d]]</code></p><p>\n   If you want the elements in reverse order, you can reverse the sorted list\n   by calling the  function on the sorted\n   list.\n  </p><p>\n   To sort all of the units with dimensions of time (or by extension, any\n   dimension list) by their magnitude, you can use the following.  (Keep in\n   mind that the  function returns the  of the\n   units as strings.  The function  returns\n   the unit with the specified name.:\n  </p><p><code>\n    sort[units[time], { |a,b| unit[a] &lt;=&gt; unit[b] }]\n   </code></p><p><code>\n    sort[unitsWithValues[time], byColumn[1]]\n   </code></p><p>\n   The default  functions sort strings in a simple and fast\n   way (according to the order of characters in Unicode,) but in a way\n   that is likely not correct according to the sorting methods for most human\n   languages.  To sort strings correctly,\n    functions should be used.\n  </p><p>\n   These functions understand alphabetization rules, Unicode normalization\n   rules for characters with accents, alternate ways of specifying the same\n   character, as well as the rules for most human languages and the way that\n   their alphabetization rules differ.  They are very clever, and will make\n   you look smart for using them correctly.\n  </p><p>\n   The function  sorts an array of\n   strings using the default language and locale settings defined in your Java\n   Virtual Machine:\n  </p><p><code>\n    a = [\"ökonomisch\", \"offenbar\", \"olfaktorisch\", \"Arg\", \"Ärgerlich\", \"Arm\", \"Assistent\", \"Aßlar\", \"Assoziation\", \"eñe\", \"ene\", \"enne\"]</code><code>\n    [Arg, Ärgerlich, Arm, Assistent, Aßlar, Assoziation, ene, eñe, enne, offenbar, ökonomisch, olfaktorisch]\n   </code></p><p>\n   (Note that this was using an English locale, which also has good default\n   rules that work correctly for other languages.)  Compare this to the order\n   produced by the basic sort, which doesn't know anything about special\n   characters:\n  </p><p><code>\n    [Arg, Arm, Assistent, Assoziation, Aßlar, ene, enne, eñe, offenbar, olfaktorisch, Ärgerlich, ökonomisch]\n   </code></p><p>\n   Which bears no resemblance to any alphabetical ordering that most human\n   languages would expect.  The price is that lexical sorting is slower and\n   more expensive.  But it's a small price for being right, and\n   internationalization-capable.\n  </p><p>\n   Note that the sorting order depends on  Java Virtual Machine's\n   locale and language settings.  If you want to force sorting for a\n   particular language, you can use the <code>lexicalSort[,\n    ]</code> function to specify its language code using\n   the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php\">ISO\n    639-1</a> two-letter code for the language.  For example, repeating the\n    above example for Turkish, whose language code is :\n  </p><p><code>\n    [Arg, Arm, Assistent, Assoziation, Aßlar, Ärgerlich, ene, eñe, enne, offenbar, olfaktorisch, ökonomisch]\n   </code></p><p>\n   (Note that, according to the rules of Turkish, the letter\n    is treated as a separate character alphabetized after\n   .  The same is true for  and\n   .)\n  </p><p>\n   Another example, using Danish and its possibly surprising alphabetization\n   rules:\n  </p><p><code>\n    a = [\"Ærø\", \"Aalborg\", \"Tårnby\", \"Vejen\", \"Thisted\", \"Stevns\", \"Sønderborg\"]\n    \n    lexicalSort[a, \"da\"]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>\n    [Stevns, Sønderborg, Thisted, Tårnby, Vejen, Ærø, Aalborg]\n   </code></p><p>\n   That order is correct, with names beginning with \"Aa\" alphabetized last.\n  </p><p>\n   If you need extreme control over the sorting order, the second argument of\n   <code>lexicalSort[, ]</code> can be either a\n   <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/Collator.html\"></a>\n   or a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html\"></a>\n   object which allows you very detailed control over creating custom sorting\n   rules or locales.  Please see the documentation for those classes for\n   details on controlling sorting.\n  </p><p>\n   You can also normalize strings containing Unicode characters into a\n   \"canonical\" form.  See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#CorrectStringParsing\"></a>\n   function for more information about this.\n  </p><p>\n   If the values to be sorted by the  functions are\n   not strings, they can still be sorted as long as they are comparable to\n   each other.  The default sort order will be used when values are not\n   strings.\n  </p><p>\n   As of the 2024-07-11 release,  now compares\n   sub-arrays also.  For example, in an array of arrays, \n   sorts before .  Shorter arrays sort before longer ones.\n  </p><p>\n   This is all pretty cool and powerful, right?  Your programs can now\n   demonstrate knowledge about many, many human languages and do the right\n   thing with them!\n  </p><p>\n   The following functions operate on all the elements of an array:\n  </p><p>\n   The  function allows you to select the items from a list for\n   which  returns .  For example, to select\n   the even items from a list:\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n    select[ array, { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 } ]</code></p><p>\n   This successively assigns each element of  to a new\n   local variable , and returns the list of values for which\n    equals zero.\n  </p><p>\n   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of\n   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function\n   arguments.\n  </p><p>\n   The following sample selects pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,\n   do  contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the\n   greatest common factor is 1.):\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]\n    coprime = {|x,y| gcd[x,y] == 1}</code><code>[[2, 3], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</code></p><p> The second argument to  can also be a regular expression.  This expects the\n   list to contain all strings and returns all of the strings that match the\n   regular expression.\n  </p><p> The second argument to  can also be a substring.  This expects the\n   list to contain all strings and returns items which\n   contain the specified substring (with an exact match.)  If you need a\n   case-insensitive match, the second argument should be a regular expression.\n  </p><p>\n   If the  function needs additional data to perform its\n   work, you can use the three-argument \n   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with\n   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary\n   data.  For example, to select all the elements of a list that are greater\n   a certain number (in the following case, 2):\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n    select[ array, { |x, data|  x &gt; data }, 2]</code></p><p>\n   Similarly, the three-argument  function that passes in\n   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your\n   selector function.\n  </p><p>\n   The following example selects pairs whose product is larger than a specific\n   number (in this case, 50).\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]\n    product = {|x,y,data| x*y &gt; data}<p>\n    select[array, product, 50]</p></code></p><p>  As of the 2014-05-09 release, the\n    and  functions now try\n   harder to keep their return values as arrays if passed an array, and an\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expression</a> if passed an\n    enumerating expression.  In addition, they now keep dictionaries as\n    dictionaries, <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#OrderedList\">OrderedList</a>s as OrderedLists, and\n    <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Sets\">sets</a> as sets.  To obtain other types, ,\n    , and \n    functions.  If in doubt, use these functions directly to change the return\n    types.)\n   However,closing the results in a <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ForLoop\"> loop</a> will still work to enumerate\n   through all contained objects, no matter what the return type is.)\n  </p><p>\n   This makes these functions now work properly with infinite series, and work\n   more responsively with long-running operations that return information\n   periodically. ( searches.)  This change may also allow\n   significantly-reduced memory consumption, as you can process each element\n   and then forget about it, rather than holding on to a large array of\n   values.\n  </p><p>\n   The inverse of  is .  Read below.\n  </p><p>\n   The inverse of the  function is \n   which works similarly to , but  all\n   items from a list that match the condition.\n  </p><p>\n   The  function allows you to remove the items from a list for\n   which  returns .  For example, to remove\n   the even items from a list:\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n    remove[ array, { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 } ]</code></p><p>\n   This successively assigns each element of  to a new\n   local variable , and removes all values for which\n    equals zero.\n  </p><p>\n   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of\n   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function\n   arguments.\n  </p><p>\n   The following sample removes pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,\n   do  contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the\n   greatest common factor is 1.):\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]\n    coprime = {|x,y| gcd[x,y] == 1}</code></p><p> The second argument to  can also be a regular expression.  This expects the\n   list to contain all strings and removes all of the strings that match the\n   regular expression, returning the items that did  match.\n  </p><p>\n   For example, if you wanted to remove all filenames that contained the\n   substring  from a list, you might have to write a\n   somewhat complicated, non-obvious regular expression that does not match\n   that pattern using select: \n  </p><p><code>select[files,  %r/^(.(?!(CVS)))*$/]</code></p><p>\n   Or, more simply, use  and a simpler pattern that matches\n   the strings we want to remove:\n  </p><p>\n   If the  function needs additional data to perform its\n   work, you can use the three-argument \n   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with\n   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary\n   data.  For example, to remove all the elements of a list that match a\n   certain number (in the following case, 2):\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n    remove[ array, { |x, data|  x == data }, 2]</code></p><p>\n   Similarly, the three-argument  function that passes in\n   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your\n   selector function.\n  </p><p>\n   The following example removes pairs whose product is larger than a specific\n   number (in this case, 50).\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]\n    product = {|x,y,data| x*y &gt; data}<p>\n    remove[array, product, 50]</p></code></p><p>\n   The functions \n   and \n   and <code>mapList[, , ]</code> apply\n   the specified function to all the members of a list, and returns a new list\n   containing the results.  This is usually faster and more concise than\n   applying a function to a list of arguments in a loop.\n  </p><p>\n   There are two different, but similar functions:  \n   and .  Here is how to choose the function you want:\n  </p><ul><li>: If you want to write a function that takes multiple\n    arguments,  helps you by splitting an array of arguments\n    into named variables for easy use in your function.\n\n   </li><li>: If your function just wants to handle an array of\n    values , without modification,\n    use .  Normally, you provide a \n    function that receives the array.  If you use the three-argument version\n    <code>mapList[, , ]</code>, your\n    function will have  arguments, .\n  </li></ul><p>\n   The  parameter may be either a string\n   containing the name of the function or a function, possibly an <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#AnonymousFunctions\">anonymous function</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   If your list of arguments all have the same number of items, you can pass\n   in the function name as a string:\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [0,1,4,9]\n    map[\"sqrt\", array]</code></p><p>\n   You may want to pass in a reference to the function itself as the first\n   parameter.  You can do this by calling the <code>getFunction[,\n   ]</code> function.  For example, to return the greatest\n   common denominator of successive pairs of numbers, you might do the\n   following:\n  </p><p><code>\n    array = [[3,5], [2,10], [24, 36]]\n    g = getFunction[\"gcd\", 2]</code></p><p><code>\n    array = [1,2,3]\n    double = {|a|  a*2 }</code></p><p>\n   Anonymous arrays with any number of arguments are allowed, as long as each\n   element of your list is a list containing the right number of items.\n  </p><p>\n   Currently, all elements of the list must have the same number of elements\n   and will resolve to the same function call.\n  </p><p>\n   If the number of items that will be passed to the function is greater than\n   the number of formal arguments defined by the function, all of the extra\n   arguments will be passed as an array to the last argument of the function.\n   For example, if we define a function that only takes one argument, but pass\n   it three items in each list, all three items will be passed as an array:\n  </p><p><code>\n    concat = {|i| join[\"\", i]}\n    a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]</code></p><p>\n   While this works in the above case, passing a one-argument array does not\n   work correctly.  You need to use  in that case.\n  </p><p><code>\n    concat = {|i| join[\"\", i]}\n    a = [[1],[4,5],[7,8,9]]</code><code>Error when calling function println:\n    &nbsp;Error when calling function map:<p>\n    &nbsp;Error when calling function join:\n    &nbsp;Second argument to join must be a list.\n   </p></code></p><p>\n   This is because the  function tries to \"break up\" the list\n   and assign items from the list to named variables, and assigns any\n   remaining items to the last variable of the function.  If you\n   use  in this case, it works correctly.\n  </p><p><code>\n    concat = {|i| join[\"\", i]}\n    a = [[1],[4,5],[7,8,9]]</code></p><p>\n   You can test what your function is receiving by replacing your function\n   with something that just returns its value:\n  </p><p><code>\n    echo = {|i| i}\n    a = [[1],[4,5],[7,8,9]]</code></p><p>\n   As you can see, the first result  is not returned as an\n   array.  Use  if you always want arrays handled as\n   arrays, and not put into individual variables.\n  </p><p>\n   If you need to pass additional data for the function to do its job, you can\n   use the\n   three-argument <code>mapList[, , ]</code>\n   function.  The third argument,  is arbitrary data that\n   will be passed to the second argument of  which must\n   take two parameters, .\n  </p><p>\n   The following returns  for all values that are greater\n   than the threshold value passed in the variable .\n  </p><p><code>\n    gt = {|list, data| list &gt; data}\n    a = [1,2,3,4]</code><code>[false, false, true, true]</code></p><p>\n   A string can be split into an array using the  function which splits the string into parts.  The first\n   argument to the  function\n   can be either a regular expression or a string containing the delimiter.\n   Conversely, the elements of an array can be joined into a string with a\n   fixed delimiter, using </p><p>\n   Splitting a string into an array, splitting on whitespace (the pattern\n    matches 1 or more whitespace characters:)\n  </p><p><code>array = split[ %r/\\s+/, \"1 2 3 4 5\"]</code></p><p>\n   Or, to split a tab-delimited line into elements:\n  </p><p><code>array = split[\"\\t\", line]</code>\n   which is the same as<code>array = split[%r/\\t/, line]</code></p><p>\n   A string can be split into lines on any newline characters\n   (<code>\\r\\n|\\r|\\n|\\u2028|\\u2029|\\u000B|\\u000C|\\u0085</code>) using\n   the  function which returns an array of\n   strings with the newlines removed.\n  </p><p><code>line = \"One\\nTwo\\nThree\"\n    println[splitLines[line]]</code></p><p>\n   The reverse of \n   is  which joins multiple\n   array elements into one string, with elements separated by the specified\n   string.\n  </p><p>\n   The single-argument function  joins array\n   elements with no separator.  This is equivalent\n   to </p><p>\n   Returns a string where the elements of  are\n   returned as a single string where the elements are separated by your\n   platform's newline character(s).  That is, each element in the list are\n   separated by newlines and probably printed on a line by itself.\n  </p><p>\n   The inverse of \n   is  which takes a string and splits\n   the string on newlines.\n  </p><p>\n   The function  \"zips\" together\n   corresponding elements of lists  and  and\n   returns each pair as a two-element array.  (This is what this function is\n   usually called in functional programming, and has nothing to do with the\n   zip compression format.)  For example:\n  </p><p>\n   If one list is longer than the other, the shorter list will be\n   padded with  values.  If  arguments are\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expressions</a>, the result will be an efficient enumerating\n   expression.  Otherwise, the arguments will be converted to arrays and the\n   result will be an array (which is potentially large.)  Also note that an\n   array  an <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expression</a> too!\n  </p><p>\n   The results can be processed individually with the  loop:\n  </p><p><code>\n    for a = zip[1 to million, 3 to million + 3]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[a]</code></p><p>\n   If you wish to pad with values other than , there is a\n   4-argument version of the function <code>zip[, ,\n    , ]</code> that specifies what values to pad\n   each list with.\n  </p><p>\n   The inverse of the  function is\n   the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#unzip\"></a> function below.\n  </p><p>\n   The function  is the inverse of\n   the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#zip\"></a> function and \"unzips\" the columns\n   of a given <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expression</a>\n   (which can be an array) into seperate arrays and returns an array of\n   arrays.  (This is what this function is usually called in functional\n   programming, and has nothing to do with the zip compression format.)  (The\n   return types are currently arrays, but this may change.)  For example, this\n   inverts the list produced by the  function above and\n   separates it into two arrays called  and .\n  </p><p><code>a = [ [1,6], [2,7], [3,8] ]\n    [b,c] = unzip[a]</code></p><p>\n   For ease of maintenance, you can separate your program code into multiple\n   files and include them in other files.  This is accomplished by the\n    statement.  This includes the contents of the named file\n   at compile-time, at the point where the  statement is\n   encountered.  For example, to include a file called\n    in the current directory:\n  </p><p>\n   The  statement searches for the named files in the\n   following places:\n  </p><ol><li>Relative to the root of the current classpath or jar file.\n    \n   </li><li>If the statement specifies a fully-qualified URL, the URL is loaded.\n    This includes , , and\n     URLs.\n    \n   </li><li>Relative to the current file or URL being parsed.\n    \n   </li><li>Relative to the current working directory.\n    \n   </li><li>From the internal \"standard library\" shipped within the jar file's\n     directory.  This location may change.\n  </li></ol><p>\n   The  statement has protection against including a file\n   multiple times.\n  </p><p> If you're including a file that's  relative to any\n   of the above, you'll need to specify it using an  URL, such as:\n  </p><p><code>use file:///c:/prog/frink/samples/sun.frink</code>\n   or<code>use file:///prog/frink/samples/sun.frink</code></p><p>\n   This is necessary because a file or relative URL can legitimately contain\n   colons on some operating systems.  For example, on a UNIX-like system, you\n   could have a subdirectory called  and that would be just\n   fine.  Frink doesn't try to duplicate all the quirks of all operating\n   systems and their wacky filename rules.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink allows you to write your programs in object-oriented fashion,\n   allowing complex data structures that are still easy to use.  Inheritance\n   is not implemented, (and many people may argue that it shouldn't be\n   implemented) but works fine for programs that don't require inheritance.\n  </p><p>\n   Classes are defined using the  keyword and a syntax that\n   won't particularly surprise anyone who has worked with Java, C++, Ruby,\n   Python, or other object-oriented languages.\n  </p><p>\n   The format of a class and how to use it is demonstrated in the \n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=classtest.frink\">classtest.frink</a>\n   file.\n  </p><p>\n   Interfaces are defined using the  keyword, and is\n   similar to Java's implementation.\n  </p><p>\n   Methods on an object can be listed using the\n    function.  If  is an\n   instance of an object, this lists the instance-level \n   class-level methods of that object.  If called with a classname (that gives\n   you the \"Metaclass Object\" for that class,) it displays just the\n   class-level methods.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink has a  block which allows the programmer to\n   ensure that code is called no matter what happens in a block of code.  The\n   code within the  block is executed whether the block is\n   exited from a  statement, or if an error occurs in the\n   code, or whatever.\n  </p><p>\n   If the body of the  or  block is a\n   single line, it can be written without curly braces.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink expressions can be formatted in a variety of formats.  There are\n   currently different formatters for human-readable and machine-readable\n   forms:\n  </p><ul><li>: The default, human-friendly output format.\n   </li><li>: A machine-readable format, suitable for passing\n    to Frink as input, and parsing with the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#SelfEvaluation\"></a> function.  This lets you\n   easily save and load most Frink data structures (and programs,) send them\n    over a network, etc., in a simple, safe and reversible\n    way.   converts all ASCII characters outside the\n    ASCII range 32-127 into escape codes, making it safe for use in a 7-bit\n    ASCII pipeline.\n   </li><li>: A machine-readable format, suitable for passing\n    to Frink as input, and parsing with the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#SelfEvaluation\"></a> function.  This\n    assumes that you have a working Unicode environment and does not escape\n    non-ASCII characters like  does.\n  </li></ul><p>\n   More formatters will follow, possibly for formatting into other languages\n   (e.g. JavaScript/JSON).\n  </p><p>\n   Several new functions have been added to support formatting in\n   different formats:\n  </p><ul><li><code>format[, ]</code> formats the\n    expression to a string using the specified formatter.  Current formatters\n    include the strings \n    and .   is a formatter that\n    provides Frink's input form that can be easily parsed by a call\n    to .   is the\n    human-friendly formatter, which has been greatly improved for the\n    introduction of multiple formatters.\n    \n   </li><li> lists the currently-available\n    expression formatters.\n\n   </li><li>\n    and \n    and <code>inputFormUnicode[]</code> are aliases\n    for <code>format[,\"Input\"]</code>\n    and <code>format[,\"Output\"]</code>\n    and <code>format[,\"UnicodeInput\"]</code> respectively.\n    \n   </li><li>Formatting options such as ,\n    , , and\n     and the  operator are\n    now local to the , (and only affect the\n     formatter,) not global to the entire Java Virtual\n    Machine.  This makes it safer to embed multiple Frink parsers in a single\n    virtual machine, each with their own preferences, and makes Java Server\n    Pages more robust against poorly-behaved scripts.  (Programs still need\n    to pass a security check to set these flags on an interpreter basis.)\n  </li></ul><p>\n   The  or <code>format[,\n    \"Input\"]</code> function returns the expression in\n   a machine-readable format, suitable for passing to Frink as input, and\n   parsing with the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#SelfEvaluation\"></a>\n   function.  This lets you easily save and load most Frink data structures\n   (and programs,) send them over a network, etc., in a simple, safe and\n   reversible way.\n  </p><p><code>\n    a@\"one\" = 1\n    a@\"two\" = 2</code><code>\n    [[one, 1], [three, 3], [two, 2]]  </code><code>\n    new dict[[[\"one\", 1], [\"three\", 3], [\"two\", 2]]]</code></p><ul><li>Currently, objects created from a  specification will\n    be output as a  with name-value pairs for all instance\n    variables.  This may change.  This is currently done because there's no\n    way to guarantee that the Frink interpreter on the other end has loaded\n    the same  or a compatible version.  There are potential\n    security and correctness issues if the classes are incompatible.  A\n    malicious user could also modify the data to get around security or logic\n    checks and create invalid or dangerous objects.  It's currently left up to\n    the programmer to take these objects, validate their fields, and turn them\n    back into the objects they want on the other end.  This may change.\n    \n   </li><li>The Julian day parser can now parse rational numbers or date\n    intervals, for example:\n    <ul><li><code># JD 212263942857555001/86400000000 #</code></li><li><code># JD [212263942933679/86400000, 70754647644893/28800000] #</code></li></ul></li><li>Java objects are not currently formatted usefully.  This may change,\n    or not.\n    \n   </li><li>When outputting dates in \"input form\", the date will be formatted as\n    an exact Julian day (possibly an interval or an exact rational number as\n    above) if necessary, or in a human-readable format in UTC, if\n    sub-millisecond precision is not required, which allows exact round-trips\n    of dates.\n\n   </li><li>Strings and identifiers (e.g. variable names, function names) will be\n    encoded into an ASCII-safe form.  Characters outside the ASCII range will\n    be escaped into ASCII-safe Unicode escapes.  If you have a Unicode-safe\n    environment and want to preserve Unicode unmodified, use\n    the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#InputFormUnicode\">inputFormUnicode</a> formatter instead.\n\n   </li><li>Added  function to turn a string into\n    a network and file-encoding safe ASCII-encoded equivalent.  This is\n    useful if you don't want the full quoting of .\n\n   </li><li>Formatting options such as ,\n    , , and\n     and the  operator \n    do not apply in .\n  </li></ul><p>\n   The  or <code>format[,\n    \"UnicodeInput\"]</code> function returns the expression in\n   a machine-readable format, suitable for passing to Frink as input, and\n   parsing with the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#SelfEvaluation\"></a>\n   function.\n  </p><p>\n   Unlike the  formatter described above, it\n   does  escape Unicode characters outside the ASCII 32-127 range\n   into escape codes.  It assumes that you have a working Unicode\n   environment that will not be corrupted by intermediate tools.  For safety\n   in other environments, use the  formatter instead.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink has a powerful system for drawing graphics in a simple way.  Here are\n   some of the features:\n  </p><ul><li><b>Flexible coordinate system:</b> You can draw your graphics to any\n    coordinates you wish, and Frink will, by default, automatically scale and\n    center them in your display device, eliminating the tedium and error of\n    manual coordinate conversions, adjustment for different window or printer\n    sizes, etc.\n\n   </li><li>  Graphics can be specified with explicit\n    lengths (such as \"3 cm\",) so exactly-sized drawings can be printed.\n    (Well, as accurately as your printer's driver allows them to be!)\n\n   </li><li> Frink's graphics are primarily designed to\n    work with shapes, not individual pixels, so they can be re-scaled perfectly\n    to display with full resolution on printers, in resizable graphics\n    windows, in image files, or in rescalable vector formats.\n    \n   </li><li>  Polygons and polylines are drawn with\n    properly-joined, angled corners.\n\n   </li><li> Lines and shapes are anti-aliased, eliminating\n    jagged edges.  (When running under Java 1.2 or later.  Frink's graphics\n    will also run on Java 1.1, but without antialiased edges.)  Aliasing can\n    now be controlled through the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Antialiasing\">Antialiasing</a>\n    methods.\n\n   </li><li><b>Transparency (alpha channel):</b> Allows transparent shapes and\n    lines, and see-through shapes to be drawn on top of other shapes.\n    Anti-aliased edges are drawn with proper transparency so they can be\n    overlaid on any background color or image.  (Requires Java 1.2 or later for\n    transparency.)\n\n   </li><li>  Text can be written into any graphics\n    object, with properly transparent anti-aliased edges.  Text may be scaled\n    along with the image, or rendered at a constant size.\n\n   </li><li>  All graphics can be translated, scaled,\n    and rotated, making it very easy to draw objects to the coordinate system\n    that is easiest to use, and translating it into larger drawings.  When\n    graphics are scaled and rotated, Frink is smart enough to keep what you've\n    drawn centered and scaled to fit on the screen or printed page!\n\n   </li><li> Graphics can be easily written to various\n    file formats, including JPEG, PNG, HTML5 canvas, and Scalable Vector\n    Graphics (SVG and SVGZ) formats.  PNG supports transparency (alpha channel)\n    and allows antialiased, semi-transparent lines and shapes to be overlaid\n    over other backgrounds or layers.  SVG format allows infinite rescaling and\n    perfect rendering to high-resolution devices such as printers, and perfect\n    import into other vector graphics programs.\n\n   </li><li><b>Easy display on different devices:</b> The same graphics object\n    can be created and then displayed on screen, printed to a printer, or\n    written to a file, using a single command.\n  </li></ul><p>\n   Graphics are drawn and displayed in three steps:\n  </p><ol><li>Create an object of type :\n    </li><li>Draw your shapes into the  object:\n    <p><code>\n      g.line[1,100,100,1]\n      g.line[1,1,100,100]\n     </code></p></li><li>Show (or print, or write your image to a file):\n    </li></ol><p>\n   That's it.  Frink takes care of the scaling and centering by default.  The\n   coordinates that you choose can be whatever is most convenient and natural\n   for you.  You can also create as many  objects as you\n   want.  By default, when you call , each\n   graphics object is displayed in its own resizable window. \n  </p><p>\n   Coordinates in Frink's graphics are very flexible.  There are a few things\n   to note:\n  </p><ul><li>Coordinates are specified as (x, y) with  being the\n    horizontal coordinate and  the vertical coordinate.\n\n   </li><li>Horizontal coordinates increase as you move right.\n\n   </li><li>Vertical coordinates increase as you move down.  (Note that this is the\n    common convention for almost all computer graphics, but is different than\n    the usual mathematical conventions.  You can change this using a <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#TransformingGraphics\">Graphics Transformation</a>, but be warned\n    that will vertically flip text as well.)\n\n   </li><li><b>Arbitrary-sized coordinates:</b>  Coordinates can be as big or small\n    as you want.  Any real number that Frink can represent is fine.\n\n   </li><li><b>Automatic centering and scaling:</b> You don't need to worry about\n    the size or location of your rendering window.  By default, all graphics\n    are resized and centered to fit into your graphics device (whether it's a\n    resizable window, a printed page, or a graphic file.)  This saves lots of\n    time and effort when drawing most graphics.  Even if your graphics have\n    been scaled, translated, and rotated, Frink will still ensure that what\n    you've drawn is scaled and centered.\n\n   </li><li> Aspect ratio is preserved by default.  That is, if\n    a rectangle is 2 units wide and 1 unit high, it will retain that shape on\n    resizing.  (You can change that by multiplying all coordinates on one axis\n    by a \"dummy\" dimension that isn't dimensionless and isn't a length.)\n\n   </li><li><b>Accurately-scaled drawings</b>: Coordinates may have dimensions of\n    length (e.g. \"1 inch\"), in which case they are treated specially.  In this\n    case, the graphics are still translated to fit into your view window, but\n    Frink will also attempt to render them at the specified size.  This is\n    highly dependent on how your operating system reports its resolution.  It\n    works very well for printers, but not as well for monitors (especially in\n    Windows, which almost always reports its screen resolution as 96 dpi, no\n    matter what it really is.)

This is intentionally somewhat vague because Frink's graphics\n   operations allow for a wide variety of viewport settings with many shapes.\n  </p><p>\n   For example, to set the viewport to a rectangle, do something like the\n   following with your  object  drawing to\n   it:\n  </p><p><code>\n    g = new graphics[]\n    g.color[0,0,0,0] \n    g.fillRectSides[, , , ] \n    g.clipRectSides[, , , ] \n    g.color[0,0,0]  </code></p><p>\n   You can also clip to other shapes, such as circles, ellipses,\n   polygons, , etc.  You can also use other\n   convenience methods such\n   as , , , ,\n   etc., if they are more convenient.\n  </p><p>\n   By default, graphics and text are antialiased on most platforms.

Note that as of 2024-06-30, this file has been\n   changed from a nice text file to a giant, poorly-formatted HTML file that\n   is 10 times larger so it will cost everyone more time and money to\n   download.

So what is interval arithmetic?  Well, you can\n   think of it as a \"new kind of number\" that represents a fuzzy range of\n   values.  For example, you may know that a value lies between 1 and 2, but\n   you're not quite sure where the value lies in that interval.  Depending on\n   your philosophy, you can think of an interval as specifying a fuzzy error\n   bound, or you can think of an interval as simultaneously taking on all\n   values within its bounds.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink can take this uncertain interval and propagate the uncertainty\n   through its calculations, giving you the ability to see how the initial\n   uncertainties in your values affect your final calculations.\n  </p><p>\n   Currently, the way to indicate that something is an interval is to use the\n    syntax (although something more concise will\n   likely be added later, and the output format may change.)\n  </p><p><code>\n    a = new interval[2,3]\n    b = new interval[5,7]\n   </code></p><p>\n   The intervals can then be manipulated in mathematical expressions, either\n   with ordinary scalar variables or other intervals:\n  </p><p>\n   Intervals may also have a \"middle\" or \"main\" value which indicates the\n   best-known value.  Note that values should be specified in increasing\n   order.\n  </p><p><code>\n    d = new interval[2, 2.5, 3]\n    e = new interval[7, 8.2, 9.4]</code></p><p>\n   Of course, all intervals used in a calculation must have \"main\" values or\n   the main value will be dropped, creating an interval with only upper and\n   lower bounds.\n  </p><p>\n   Note:  The boundaries and \"main\" values for intervals must be real\n   numbers.  (These numbers can also have dimensions like feet, meters, etc.)\n   Although there is a theory of complex intervals, it's much harder and may\n   not get implemented any time soon, (although a very generous Frink user sent\n   a copy of a rare $200 textbook on complex interval arithmetic which will\n   help that situation!  Thanks, Joshua!)\n  </p><p>\n   Lest you think that intervals are simpler than they are, I find that people\n   better understand them when they consider the following case:\n  </p><p>\n   Now, let's square x.  Note that the values at each endpoint are equal to 4.\n   However, over the range [-2,2], the value of x ranges from 4,\n   down to 0 (at x=0), and back up to 4.  Frink does the right thing for the\n   values over this whole range:\n  </p><p>\n   Yeah, that  cool.  Frink tracks appropriate boundaries for\n   intervals throughout all of your calculations.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink's interval arithmetic is also rigorous in its treatment of error\n   bounds.  It painstakingly controls the rounding direction of arithmetic\n   operations so that the boundaries are guaranteed to include the\n   next-largest or next-smallest representable floating-point number that\n   contains the interval.  (See notes below on <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IntervalArithmeticStatus\">implementation status</a>.)  This\n   is subtle, but I have spent a lot of work ensuring that the boundaries came\n   out trustable, and no bigger than need be. For example:\n  </p><p><code>m = new interval[3,6]\n    1.0/m</code><code>[0.16666666666666666666, 0.33333333333333333334]</code></p><p>\n   Note that the bottom bound is rounded down, and the top bound is rounded\n   up.\n  </p><p>\n   Currently, almost all functions have been made interval-aware.\n   Implementing all functions  will take quite\n   a bit of effort.  Of course, that would be much slower, too.  Error bounds\n   are unfortunately not \"sharp\" for all operations (meaning as tight as they\n   could possibly be with limited precision.)  I've noted them as such in the\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IntervalArithmeticStatus\">Interval Arithmetic Status</a> section\n   below.\n  </p><p>\n   Not all operators such as  make unambiguous sense\n   when applied to intervals, so Frink has introduced new operators to\n   disambiguate these cases, and will implement other operators to work with\n   intervals.  See the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#IntervalComparisonOperators\">Interval\n    Comparison Operators</a> section below for more details.\n  </p><p>\n   By default, degenerate intervals which have the same upper and lower bounds\n   are \"collapsed\" into a single real number.  If you want to maintain them as\n   intervals, call the function  before\n   constructing or performing mathematics on those intervals.\n  </p><p>\n   As everyone uses Interval Arithmetic for the first time, they come upon two\n   characteristic problems in the field:  the dependence problem and the\n   overestimation problem.  These are common to all interval analysis, and not\n   just to Frink, and are covered in extensive detail in the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/faq.html#IntervalArithmetic\">Interval Arithmetic section of the\n    Frink FAQ.</a></p><p>\n   For more information about the field of Interval Arithmetic, please visit\n   the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.utep.edu/interval-comp/\">Interval Computations</a>\n   website. (Link opens in new window.)\n\n  </p><p>\n   Interval arithmetic is an incredibly powerful feature that allows programs\n   that weren't necessarily written with intervals in mind to track error\n   bounds throughout your calculations, and can be magically applied to\n   programs that are already written.  For example, let's take some\n   calculations to find the volume and density of a sphere:\n  </p><p><code>\n    circumference = eval[input[\"Enter circumference of a sphere: \"]]\n    mass = eval[input[\"Enter the mass of the sphere: \"]]<p>\n    diameter = circumference / pi</p>\n    radius = diameter / 2\n    density = mass / volume<p>\n    println[\"The density is: \" + (density -&gt; \"g/cm^3\")]\n   </p></code></p><p>\n   Now, you can run the program and enter something like \"9.1 inches\" for the\n   circumference and \"5.1 ounces\" for the mass and find out the density of your\n   baseball.  No surprises there.  But when you read the rules of Major League\n   Baseball, you'll find that section 1.09 states:\n  </p><blockquote><p>\n    \"The ball shall be a sphere formed by yarn wound around a small core of\n    cork, rubber or similar material, covered with two stripes of white\n    horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together. It shall weigh not less\n    than five nor more than 5 1/4 ounces avoirdupois and measure not less than\n    nine nor more than 9 1/4 inches in circumference.\"\n   </p></blockquote><p>\n   So, using your exact same program above, and a little interval input,\n   Frink can calculate the effects of these allowed variations and show you\n   the allowed range of densities of  legal baseball:\n  </p><p><code>Enter circumference of a sphere:</code><code>new interval[9, 9+1/4] inches</code><code>Enter the mass of the sphere:</code><code>new interval[5, 5+1/4] ounces</code><code>The density is: [0.64720283343427980773,\n    0.73778085086685322066] g/cm^3</code></p><p>\n   The output indicates the range of uncertainties.  Note that two different\n   intervals were used to perform this calculation, and the effects of their\n   uncertainties was automatically tracked throughout all calculations.  All\n   this in a program that wasn't even written with intervals in mind.\n   Unscrupulous teams may also not that the official definition allows for a\n    variation in allowable densities of baseballs, which could\n   be manipulated to your advantage.\n  </p><p>\n   Also note that I put the units of measure (e.g. inches, ounces) outside the\n   brackets.  You could put them inside the brackets, but you'd just have to\n   write them twice in this case.  Intervals can, of course, contain units of\n   measure.\n  </p><p>\n   By the way, I'm working on a more concise notation for specifying\n   intervals.\n  </p><p>\n   The relational operators (e.g. , etc) work with\n   intervals, but there are many ambiguous cases.  These operators try to Do\n   The Right Thing when applied to intervals.  If you compare intervals that\n   do not overlap, they return the appropriate result.  If, however, the\n   intervals  overlap, they terminate the program with an error\n   similar to the following:\n\n  </p><blockquote><p>\n    Comparison expression: Using operator &gt; to compare intervals [1, 3]\n    and [2, 4]\n    This operator is only defined if there is no overlap between intervals.<p>\n    Please modify your program to use interval-aware comparison operators.\n   </p></p></blockquote><p>\n   To handle the overlapping cases, Frink defines operators like \"certainly\n   less than\" () and \"possibly less than\" ().\n   These operators can directly replace the normal relational operators.\n   These new operators also work with normal real numbers, so you can still\n   write programs that run using either intervals or real numbers as input.\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Interval Comparison Operators\"><tbody><tr><td>Certainly less-than-or-equal-to\n    </td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Certainly greater-than-or-equal-to\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Possibly less-than-or-equal-to\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Possibly greater-than-or-equal-to\n  </td></tr></tbody></table><p><code>\n    a = new interval[1,3]\n    b = new interval[2,4]</code></p><p>\n   The “possibly” and “certainly” operators are related to each other by the\n   following property: The “possibly” operator is the inverse of the opposite\n   “certainly” operator. For example,  (possibly less than) is\n   the inverse of the  (certainly greater than or equal)\n   operator.  That is, when \n   returns ,  returns  and\n   vice versa.\n  </p><p>\n   As noted above, not all functions are implemented for intervals.  The\n   following table notes the status of the implementation of various operators\n   and functions.  If a function does not appear on this list, it may still\n   return values for interval arguments, but you shouldn't trust it because I\n   haven't evaluated it for discontinuities or non-monotonicity yet.\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"3\" summary=\"Interval Arithmetic Status\"><tbody><tr><th>Rigorous Error\n      Bounds?</th></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n    </td></tr><tr><td>Performed to hardware precision only.\n      Returns  corrected for quadrant.

Frink can directly call Java code to let\n   you take advantage of any Java library that's in your classpath.  Thus, you\n   can use your favorite graphing package, connect to a database, perform\n   lower-level networking, and more, directly from within Frink.\n  </p><p>\n   Java objects can be manipulated just like Frink objects, by calling their\n   methods or accessing their fields:\n  </p><p>  Note that method calls on Java objects use square\n   brackets, as they do in all Frink function and method calls:\n  </p><p>\n   Java objects that implement the interfaces\n   , , or\n    can be used as a Frink enumerating\n   expression, allowing them to be used in  loops or other\n   places that allow <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expressions</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   The Java  will be converted to/from the Frink type\n   .\n  </p><p>\n   New Java objects can be created with the \n   and <code>newJava[classname, argList]</code> functions.  These call Java\n   constructors with the specified arguments.  If the constructor takes a\n   single argument,  can be a single value, otherwise it\n   should be an array of values.  If the constructor takes no arguments, then\n   the last argument can be eliminated entirely.  The following creates a new\n   Frame and calls some methods on the Frame to display it.  Note that the\n   method calls require square brackets.\n  </p><p><code>f = newJava[\"javax.swing.JFrame\", \"Frink Rules!\"]\n    f.setSize[200,200]\n    f.toFront[]</code></p><p>\n   Arrays of Java objects, including primitives, can be constructed with the\n   <code>newJavaArray[, ]</code>\n   method.\n  </p><p><code>\n    d = newJavaArray[\"byte\", 1024]\n    d@0 = 0x65\n   </code></p><p>\n   The classname should\n   be a string containing either be a fully-qualified classname\n   (e.g. ) or a primitive type name,\n   (e.g.  or ).  Elements of Java\n   arrays are addressed the same way as other <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Arrays\">arrays</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   Multi-dimensional arrays of Java objects can be created by the same\n   function, but with an array of integers specifying the size of each\n   dimension.  For example, the following creates a two-dimensional array of\n    with dimensions 3 by 4:\n  </p><p><code>\n    d = newJavaArray[\"double\", [3,4]]\n    d@0@0 = 3.14\n   </code></p><p>\n   The initial value of all of the elements of a new Java array can be\n   specified with the three-argument version of the\n   function: <code>newJavaArray[, , ]</code>:\n  </p><p><code>\n    d = newJavaArray[\"double\", [3,4], 3.14]</code></p><p>\n   Yes, this is  simpler than doing the same thing in Java!\n  </p><p>\n   The methods on a Java object can be listed using the\n    function:\n  </p><p><code>\n    f = newJava[\"javax.swing.JFrame\", [] ]\n    sort[methods[f]]\n   </code></p><p>\n   This makes it easy to experiment with Java libraries without writing\n   extensive unnecessary boilerplate code, recompiling, etc.  Frink has been\n   called \"an easier Java than Java.\"\n  </p><p>\n   If you don't have an instance of the class, you can call static methods in\n   Java classes using the <code>callJava[classname, methodname, argList]</code>\n   function.  The following uses the  class to\n   generate a random number.\n  </p><p><code>n = callJava[\"java.lang.Math\", \"random\", [] ]</code></p><p>\n   If the method requires no arguments, as in the above example, the last\n   argument can be eliminated:\n  </p><p><code>n = callJava[\"java.lang.Math\", \"random\"]</code></p><p>\n   Lame example, huh?  Especially when Frink can already generate random\n   numbers.  The same syntax can be used to get a database driver, or\n   something more interesting.\n  </p><p>\n   You can access static variables in a class without having an instance of\n   the class by calling the <code>staticJava[classname, fieldname]</code>\n   function.\n  </p><p><code>green = staticJava[\"java.awt.Color\", \"GREEN\"]</code><code>JavaObject:java.awt.Color</code></p><p>\n   You can then call methods on that object:\n  </p><p>\n   If you've constructed a Frame as in the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#CreatingJavaObjects\">Creating Java Objects</a> section above, you\n   can set its background color by:\n  </p><p>\n   As of the 2014-04-21 release, Frink turns values returned from\n    into their corresponding Frink types.  If you need\n   the original, raw Java object (say, for code that checks object identity,)\n   then you can call the three-argument version of the function, passing\n    as the third argument (this indicates that the value\n   should  be mapped to a Frink type):\n  </p><p><code>staticJava[\"javax.swing.SwingConstants\", \"LEFT\"]</code></p><p><code>staticJava[\"javax.swing.SwingConstants\", \"LEFT\", false]</code><code>JavaObject:java.lang.Integer</code></p><p>\n   Sometimes you may have to call functions or methods by name.  For example,\n   calling a method called  on a Java object\n   is impossible in Frink because  is a reserved word and\n   produces a syntax error!  To get around this, use the\n   <code>callByName[, , ]</code>\n   function.\n  </p><p><code>callByName[iterator, \"next\", [] ]</code></p><p>\n   If the first argument (normally an object) is , then the\n   function with the specified name will be called.\n  </p><p>\n   If the argument list is empty, as above, you can eliminate it entirely:\n  </p><p><code>callByName[iterator, \"next\"]</code></p><p>\n   If the argument list is a single element, you don't have to pass it as a\n   list: \n  </p><p><code>callByName[undef, \"println\", \"yo\"]</code></p><p>\n   Similarly, you can get a reference to a function by calling\n   <code>getFunction[, ]</code> which returns a\n   reference to the function with the specified name (specified as a string)\n   and number of arguments.  This can then be assigned to variables, or called\n   as noted in the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#AnonymousFunctions\">Anonymous Functions</a>\n   section of the documentation.\n  </p><p>\n   The  loop can be used to iterate over the contents of most\n   Java collections, including , ,\n   , , ,\n   , (which includes ,\n   ,  etc.), \n   (which includes almost  types in Java,\n   and anything that can be used in Java's  statement)\n   </p><p>\n   For most Java collections, you can iterate through the contents using a\n    loop (which is really just a \"for each\" loop.)\n  </p><p><code>\n    for a = \n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[a]</code></p><p>\n   If the Java class implements the  interface (this\n   includes classes like , ,\n   , etc), it can be treated like a Frink <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#Dictionaries\">dictionary</a>.  This includes enumerating over\n    pairs:\n  </p><p><code>\n    for [key,value] = \n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[\"$key maps to $value\"]</code></p><p>\n   All of these Java collections can be treated as <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#EnumeratingExpressions\">enumerating expressions</a> in\n   Frink, so all of the functions and methods that can operate on enumerating\n   expressions can operate on Java collections.  For example, Java collections\n   can be converted to other types using functions like\n   , , , or\n   manipulated with functions like , etc.\n  </p><p>\n   If you are using a Java data structure that puts Frink or Java data types\n   into a data structure that needs a  to\n   perform the comparisons (,)\n   you can get Frink's default Comparator (which follows the same semantics as\n   Frink's <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#ThreeWayComparison\">three-way\n   comparison</a> operator,) by calling .\n   Frink's default comparator will also compare Java objects that implement\n   the  interface so it can be used for Frink\n   and Java data types.\n  </p><p>\n   You can also implement a  that uses a\n   Frink function to perform the comparison.  The function should take two\n   arguments  and return -1 if a&lt;b, 0 if a==b, and 1 if\n   a&gt;b\n  </p><p><code>c = new Comparator[ {|a,b| a &lt;=&gt; b } ]</code></p><p>\n   If additional data is needed to perform the comparison, you can pass an\n   arbitrary expression as the second argument of the Comparator constructor.\n   This data will be passed as a third argument to the function.  For example,\n   the following Comparator sorts the elements by their distance from 20.\n  </p><p><code>c = new Comparator[ {|a,b,data| abs[a-data] &lt;=&gt; abs[b-data] }, 20]</code></p><p>\n   Not only can you call Java from Frink, but you can call Frink from Java.\n   It's quite easy to embed a Frink parser into any Java program and give\n   those programs all of the power of Frink.  It can take just a few lines of\n   Java:\n  </p><p><code>//At the top of your file...\n    import frink.parser.Frink;\n    Frink interp = new Frink();<p>\n    // Enable security here?  Currently commented-out.</p>\n    // interp.setRestrictiveSecurity(true);\n    {<p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results = interp.parseString(\"2+2\");</p>\n    }<p>\n    catch (frink.errors.FrinkEvaluationException fee)</p>\n    {<p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Do whatever you want with the exception</p>\n    }</code></p><p>: Frink is a Turing-complete programming language, and\n    evaluates a string as a complete program.  A\n   Frink interpreter normally has the ability to read your filesystem, call\n   arbitrary Java code, execute infinite loops, allocate infinite amounts of\n   memory, write large amounts of output, and do other things which may\n   compromise your security.  Thus, if you're taking input from\n   untrusted users, it's critical to call:\n\n  </p><p><code>.setRestrictiveSecurity(true);</code></p><p>\n   before parsing any user input.  This will enable the highest\n   level of security, prohibiting all untrusted actions.\n  </p><p>\n   There are more methods for calling Frink from within a Java program.  One\n   of the major problems is that converting from Frink types to Java types is\n   almost always a narrowing operation.\n  </p><p>\n   For example, if you try to put a Frink value into a Java integer:\n  </p><ul><li>It could be a non-integer (rational number, floating point).\n\n   </li><li>It may have wrong unit types.\n\n   </li><li>It could be something else like a String or an Object.\n  </li></ul><p>\n   As a result, all of these interface methods throw a variety of exceptions.\n  </p><p>\n   If you're interested in integrating Frink into your company's products,\n   please contact <a href=\"mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com\">Alan Eliasen</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   The following sections demonstrates some of the real-world calculations I've\n   made with Frink.\n  </p><p>\n   Let's say you wanted to fill your bedroom up with water.  How much water\n   would it take?  Let's say your room measures 10 feet by 12 feet wide by\n   8 feet high.\n  </p><p><code>10 feet 12 feet 8 feet -&gt; gallons</code><code>552960/77 (approx. 7181.298701298701)</code></p><p>\n   It would take approximately 7181 gallons to fill it.  Note that you get\n   both an exact fraction and an approximation.  (If you don't want to see the\n   fraction, put a decimal point in any of the numbers, like \n   or  .)\n   How much would that weigh, if you filled it with water?  Frink has the unit\n   \"water\" which stands for the density of water.\n  </p><p><code>10. feet 12 feet 8 feet water -&gt; pounds</code></p><p>\n   So it would weigh almost 60,000 pounds.  What if you knew that your floor\n   could only support 2 tons?  How deep could you fill the room with water?\n  </p><p><code>2. tons / (10 feet 12 feet water) -&gt; feet</code></p><p>\n   So you could only fill it about 0.53 feet deep.  It'll be a pretty sad pool\n   party.\n  </p><p>\n   You can set variables on the fly, by using the assignment\n    operator.  Let's say you want to define a new unit\n   representing the amount of alcohol in a can of (quality) 3.2 beer.  Keep in\n   mind that 3.2 beer is measured by alcohol/weight, while almost all other\n   liquors (and many beers) are usually measured in alcohol/volume.  The\n   density ratio between water and alcohol is given by:\n  </p><p>\n   Water is thus 1.267 times denser than alcohol.  3.2 beer (measured by\n   weight) is thus actually 4.0 percent alcohol as measured by volume.  Now\n   let's set that variable in terms of a beer's density of alcohol per volume\n   so we can compare:\n  </p><p><code>beer = 12 floz 3.2 percent water/alcohol</code></p><p>\n   Then, you wanted to find out how many beers a big bottle of champagne is\n   equal to:\n  </p><p><code>magnum 13.5 percent -&gt; beer</code></p><p>\n   You probably don't want to drink that whole bottle.  Now let's say you're\n   mixing Jungle Juice (using a 1.75 liter bottle of Everclear (190 proof!))\n   and Kool-Aid to fill a 5-gallon bucket (any resemblance to my college\n   parties is completely intentional.)  What percent alcohol is that stuff?\n  </p><p><code>junglejuice = 1.75 liter 190 proof / (5 gallon)\n    junglejuice -&gt; \"percent\"</code><code>8.78372074090843481138500000 percent</code></p><p>\n   It's really not  strong.  About 8.8%.  But if you drink 5 cups\n   of that, at 12 fluid ounces each, how many beers have you had?\n  </p><p><code>5 12 floz junglejuice -&gt; \"beer\"</code></p><p>\n   Maybe that's why people were getting punched in the head.  </p><p>\n   Some more useful calculations, most thanks to the lovely Steve Clymer:\n  </p><p>\n   How many cases in a keg?  (A keg is a normal-sized keg, what those in the\n   beer industry would call a \"half barrel,\" or  in\n   Frink notation.  I don't think they sell full barrels.  I've never seen\n   one.  It would weigh 258 pounds.  A \"pony keg\" is a \"quarter barrel\" or, in\n   Frink notation,  or )\n  </p><p><code>62/9 (approx. 6.888888888888889)</code></p><p>\n   How many 12 fluid ounce drinks ( cans o' beer) in a keg?\n  </p><p><code>496/3 (approx. 165.33333333333334)</code></p><p>\n   What is the price in dollars per fluid ounce of alcohol when buying a keg of\n   3.2 beer?  (Remember that 3.2 beer is measured in alcohol/weight, so we\n   correct by the density ratio of  to get alcohol by\n   volume:)\n  </p><p><code>(60 dollars)/(keg 3.2 percent water/alcohol) -&gt; \"dollars/floz\"</code></p><p>\n   A bottle of cheap wine?  (A \"winebottle\" is the standard 750 ml size.)\n  </p><p><code>(6.99 dollars)/(winebottle 13 percent) -&gt; \"dollars/floz\"</code></p><p>\n   A big plastic bottle of really bad vodka?\n  </p><p><code>(13.99 dollars)/(1750 ml 80 proof) -&gt; \"dollars/floz\"</code><code>0.59104811225625 dollars/floz</code></p><p>\n   In the movie , the alien mother ship is said to be\n   500 km in diameter and have a mass 1/4 that of earth's moon.  If the mother\n   ship were a sphere, what would its density be?  (The volume of a sphere is\n   4/3 pi radius)\n  </p><p><code>1/4 moonmass / (4/3 pi (500/2 km)^3) -&gt; water</code></p><p>\n   This makes the ship  denser than water.  This is 36 times\n   denser than iron and more than 12 times denser than any known element!  As\n   the ship is actually more a thin disc than a sphere, it would actually be\n   even denser.  Since it contains lots of empty space, parts of it would have\n   to be much, much denser.\n  </p><p>\n   If the object is this dense and has such a large mass, what is its surface\n   gravity?  Surface gravity is given by G mass / radius, where G\n   is the gravitational constant (which Frink knows about):\n  </p><p><code>G 1/4 moonmass / (500/2 km)^2 -&gt; gravity</code></p><p>\n   The surface gravity of the spaceship is thus at least \n   earth's gravity--and that's on the rim where gravity is weakest.  It\n   would actually be much higher since it's much, much flatter than a sphere.\n   I hope you're not the alien that has to go outside and paint it.\n  </p><p>\n   You can calculate the day that your company will run out of cash, based on\n   their financial statements.  The following is an example for a real company,\n   based on SEC filings, which read as the following:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" summary=\"Sample Financial Data\"><caption>Cash and Cash Equivalents (in thousands)</caption><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>\n   To make this more readable, you can define variables to hold values:\n  </p><p><code>burnrate = (#2001-06-30# - #2000-12-31#) / ((86481 - 41601) thousand dollars)</code></p><p>\n   You can calculate the number of days until the money runs out at this rate:\n  </p><p><code>41601 thousand dollars / burnrate -&gt;\n    \"days\"</code></p><p>\n   Using date/time math, starting from the last report date (June 30,\n   2001) you can find out the exact date this corresponds to:\n  </p><p><code>#2001-06-30# + 41601 thousand dollars /\n    burnrate</code><code>AD 2001-12-14 04:41:38.101 PM (Fri) Mountain Standard Time</code></p><p>\n   Just in time to see the cinema release of the first  movie with your last six bucks.  Will they know it's\n   Christmas Time at all?\n  </p><p>\n   At the moment, I'm watching CNN which is discussing some land-mines used in\n   Afghanistan.  They showed a very small mine (about the size of a bran\n   muffin) containing \"51 grams of TNT\" and they asked how much destructive\n   force that carries.  Frink's data file includes how much energy is in a\n   mass of TNT, specified by the unit \"TNT\".  How many feet in the air could\n   51 grams of TNT throw me, assuming perfect efficiency, and knowing\n   <code>energy = mass * gravity * height</code>?\n  </p><p><code>51 grams TNT -&gt; 185 pounds gravity feet</code></p><p>\n   Yikes.  937 feet.  But the only difference between explosives and other\n   combustible fuels is the rapidity of combustion, not in the quantity of\n   energy.  How much gasoline contains the same amount of energy?\n  </p><p><code>51 grams TNT -&gt; \"teaspoons gasoline\"</code><code>1.2903255 teaspoons gasoline</code></p><p>\n   1.29 teaspoons?  That's not much at all.  You're buying a huge amount of\n   energy when you fill up your car.\n  </p><p>\n   I need a monocle, but I don't want to pay a lot for it.  The eBay monocle\n   auction ends in 7 hours and 44 minutes... what time do I need to set the\n   alarm clock for to remind me?\n  </p><p><code>AD 2001-11-17 02:13:51.934 PM (Sat) Mountain Standard\n    Time</code></p><p> I didn't get the damned monocle.\n  </p><p>\n   I can't watch  (or lots of other television shows)\n   without having Frink at my side.  This week the team has to float a\n   submerged half-ton Cooper Mini... how many oil barrels will they need to\n   use as floats?\n  </p><p><code>half ton -&gt; barrels water</code></p><p>\n   They're trying to hand-pump air down to the barrels, submerged \"2\n   fathoms\" below the water.  If the guy can sustain 40 watts of pumping\n   power, how many minutes will it take to fill the barrel?\n  </p><p><code>2 fathoms water gravity barrel -&gt; 40 watts minutes</code></p><p>\n   And how many food Calories (a food Calorie (with a capital 'C') equals 1000\n   calories with a small 'c') will he burn to fill a barrel?\n  </p><p><code>2 fathoms water gravity barrel -&gt; Calories</code></p><p>\n   Better eat a Tic-Tac first.\n  </p><p>\n   I've seen lots of figures about how much heat the human body produces.  You\n   can easily calculate the upper limit based on how much food you eat a day.\n   Say, you eat 2000 Calories a day (again, food Calories with a capital \"C\"\n   are equal to 1000 calories with a little \"c\".)\n  </p><p><code>2000 Calories/day -&gt; watts</code></p><p>\n   So, your average power and/or heat output is slightly less than a 100-watt\n   bulb.  (Note that your heat is radiated over a much larger area so the\n   temperature is much lower.)  Many days I could be replaced entirely with a\n   100-watt bulb and have no discernible effect on the universe.\n  </p><p>\n   I'm heating up yummy mustard greens in my microwave, but I don't want to\n   overheat them.  I just want to warm them up.  If I run my 1100 watt\n   microwave for 30 seconds, how much will their temperature increase?  I have\n   a big 27 ounce (mass) can, and I'll assume that their specific heat is about\n   the same as that of water (1 calorie/gram/degC):\n  </p><p><code>1100 W 30 sec / (27 oz 1 calorie/gram/degC) -&gt; degF</code></p><p>\n   30 seconds should raise the temperature by no more than 18 degrees\n   Fahrenheit, assuming perfect transfer of microwave energy to heat.\n  </p><p>\n   Knowing this, I could see how efficiently my microwave \n   heats food.  I could heat a quantity of water and measure the temperature\n   change in the water.  I'll do that sometime if I can find my good\n   thermometer.\n  </p><p>\n   Superman is always rescuing school buses that are falling off of cliffs,\n   flying to the moon, lifting cars over his head, and generally showing off.\n   So why does he still allow so many accidents to happen?  Shouldn't he be\n   able to rescue  who has a Volkswagen parked on their\n   chest?\n  </p><p>\n   While searching for answers, I found out three interesting things about\n   Superman:\n  </p><ol><li>He's 6 feet 3 inches tall.\n   </li><li>He gets his strength from being charged up with solar energy.\n  </li></ol><p>\n   This is enough information to find some answers.  Frink has units called\n    (the total power radiated by the sun) and\n    (the distance between the earth and the sun.)  Thus,\n   we can find the sun's power that strikes an area at the distance of the\n   earth (knowing the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi radius):\n  </p><p><code>earthpower = sunpower / (4 pi sundist^2)</code></p><p>\n   This is about 1372 watts per square meter.  Superman is a pretty big\n   guy--let's say the surface area he can present to the sun is 12 square\n   feet.  (This is probably a bit high--it makes him an average of 23 inches\n   wide over his entire height.)  This allows Superman to charge up at a power\n   of:\n  </p><p><code>chargerate = earthpower 12 ft^2</code></p><p>\n   Superman thus charges up at the rate of 1530 joules/sec or 1530 watts.  At\n   this rate, how long does he have to charge up before he can lift a 2 ton\n   truck over his head?  (Knowing energy = mass * height * gravity)\n  </p><p><code>2 ton 7 feet gravity / chargerate -&gt; sec</code></p><p>\n   So, charging up for 25 seconds allows him to save one dumb kid who is acting\n   as a speed bump.  So his power is huge but not infinite.  He couldn't\n   sustain a higher rate (unless he showed off less by lifting the car only a\n   foot or two.)  Lifting a truck every 30 seconds or so isn't bad,\n   though.  He could be saving a lot more people.  So why doesn't he?\n  </p><p>\n   Well, we've all seen the movie.  He's using his super-powers to pick up\n   chicks.  Literally.  Superman decides to take a break from saving lives and\n   takes Lois Lane up in the sky for a joyride.  So how long does he have to\n   charge up with solar energy to fly himself and Lois Lane (let's say she\n   weighs 135 pounds) up to 15,000 feet?\n  </p><p><code>(225 + 135) pounds 15000 feet gravity / chargerate -&gt; minutes</code></p><p>\n   So, Superman has to charge up with solar energy for an  to\n   cart Lois up there.  With the same energy, he could have saved over 120\n   trapped kids.  Keep in mind that Lois could do her part, too.  If she left\n   her camera or big clunky shoes behind, he'd have more energy left over\n   to save people.  If she would manage to leave behind just two pounds of\n   cargo weight, Superman would have enough energy to save another kid's life.\n  </p><p>\n   Sure, he's a great guy, and, sure, he's the Defender of Truth, Justice, and\n   the American Way, but can't he find a better use for his super-powers than\n   schlepping some shiksa into the stratosphere?  Shovel my walk, he could, in\n   3 seconds--and me with the sciatica.\n  </p><p>\n   I received one of those endlessly-forwarded e-mails of dubious but\n   \"interesting facts\" which said \"if you fart continuously for 6 years and 9\n   months, you'll have enough gas to create the equivalent of an atomic bomb.\"\n   Hee hee.  Cute.  (Thanks to Heather May Howard... being unable to easily\n   calculate the veracity of this statement was one of the primary influences\n   that showed how existing programs were too limited and inspired the\n   creation of Frink.)  But I didn't believe it and wanted to check it.  The\n   Hiroshima bomb had a yield of 12.5 kilotons of TNT, which is a very small\n   bomb by today's standards.  How many horsepower would that be?\n  </p><p><code>12.5 kilotons TNT / (6 years + 9 months) -&gt; horsepower</code></p><p>\n   Can  produce a 329-horsepower blowtorch of a fart?  I doubt it.\n   That's the power produced by a Corvette engine running just at its melting\n   point.  A one-second fart with that much power could blow me 1000 feet\n   straight up.  To produce that kind of energy, how much food would you have\n   to eat a day?\n  </p><p><code>12.5 kilotons TNT / (6 years + 9 months) -&gt; Calories/day</code></p><p>\n   Ummm... can  eat over 5 million Calories a day?  (Again, note\n   that these are  Calories with a capital 'c' which are equal to\n   1000 calories with a small 'c'.)  If you were a perfect fart factory,\n   converting food energy into farts with 100% efficiency, and ate a normal\n   2000 Calories/day, how many years would it  take?\n  </p><p><code>12.5 kilotons TNT / (2000 Calories/day) -&gt; years</code></p><p>\n   17,000 years is still a huge underestimate; I don't know how much of your\n   energy actually goes into fart production.  Oh well.  To continue the\n   calculations, let's guess your butthole has a diameter of 1 inch (no,\n    go measure it.)  Let's also guess that the gas you actually\n   produce in a fart is only 1/10 as combustible as pure natural gas.  What\n   would be the velocity of the gas coming out?\n  </p><p><code>12.5 kilotons TNT / natural_gas / (6 years + 9 months)\n    / (pi (.5 in)^2) 10 -&gt; mph</code></p><p>\n   Nobody likes sitting next to a 280-mile-per-hour fart-machine.\n    Even the smallest atomic bombs are  powerful and whoever originally calculated this isn't any\n   fun to be around if they really fart that much.\n  </p><p>\n   Fart jokes.  Sheesh.  If Frink isn't a huge success, it's not because I\n   didn't pander to the Lowest Common Denominator.\n  </p><p>\n   The above order-of-magnitude estimate shows how far off the mark that the\n   fart e-mail was.  Not content with that, I found some medical studies that\n   allowed me to do a more detailed analysis of the average person's available\n   fart energy.\n  </p><p>\n   What do you think are the most flammable gases in a fart?  Most people\n   think it's methane, but I found some medical studies that disprove this.\n   Most people hardly have  methane in their intestines.  For\n   example, one study stated that only 4 out of 11 people had any detectable\n   methane in their intestines!  So what's the rest of the gas?\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" summary=\"Gases Present in Human Intestines by Volume\"><tbody></tbody></table><p>\n   These studies also note that the average person has 100 milliliters of gas\n   present in their intestinal tract at any given time.  The average person\n   expels 400-2000 ml of gas daily (and I'm not talking about through the\n   mouth and nose.)\n  </p><p>\n   Okay, that's almost enough information to figure out available fart energy.\n   Now all we need to know is the energy of combustion of the flammable gases.\n   Of the above, only hydrogen and methane are readily combustible.  Looking\n   up their energies of combustion:\n  </p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" summary=\"Combustion energy of gases in human intestine\"><tbody><tr><th>Energy of Combustion in kJ/mol\n    </th></tr></tbody></table><p>\n   Okay, that's plenty enough information to find out how much energy is\n   released in a day of farting!  Say you're on the farty end of the scale,\n   and you produce the 2000 ml of gas each day.\n  </p><p>\n   Note that the energies above are given in kJ/mol, but we have volumes in\n   milliliters.  As you may have learned in chemistry class, a mole of any gas\n   at standard temperature and pressure takes up the same volume.  Frink knows\n   this as .\n  </p><p>\n   The total energy in the hydrogen (keeping in mind that hydrogen makes up\n   19% of the 2000 ml volume) is given by:\n  </p><p><code>h2energy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 19 percent * 285.8 kJ/mol</code><code>4845.3656205695224816 m^2 s^-2 kg (energy)</code></p><p>\n   The combustible hydrogen thus produces 4800 joules (per day.)  Now, for the\n   methane, which makes a smaller percentage, but releases more energy per\n   mole:\n  </p><p><code>methaneenergy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 3.2 percent * 890.8 kJ/mol</code><code>2543.5537223989278488 m^2 s^-2 kg (energy)</code></p><p>\n   The energy in the combustible methane is thus about 2500 joules (per day),\n   about half the energy produced from the hydrogen.  Thus, the grand total of\n   energy produced by combustible farts by a farty person in a day, in food\n   Calories (with a capital C, remember--these are what a physicist would call\n   a kilocalorie) is:\n  </p><p><code>methaneenergy + h2energy -&gt; Calories</code></p><p>\n   Which gives a result of about 1.76 Calories/day of energy available from\n   burning your farts.  (About 1.16 Calories from hydrogen, and about 0.60\n   Calories from methane.)  This is out of the 2000 Calories that an average\n   person eats a day.  Or, one part in about 1133 of the energy in the food\n   you eat is available in fart energy, (again, for a gassy person.)\n  </p><p>\n   Thus, a good estimate to the problem stated above is that a real (gassy)\n   human would need to save their farts for:\n\n  </p><p><code>12.5 kilotons TNT / ((methaneenergy + h2energy) / day)\n    -&gt; years</code></p><p>\n   or about  to make the equivalent of the energy in\n   a (small) atomic bomb!  So the estimate given in that e-mail is off by a\n   factor of at least 2.8 million!\n  </p><p>\n   Now, you know the true facts about farts.  Frink is now complete, and I\n   couldn't be prouder.  Umm... thanks, Heather May.\n  </p><p>\n   That e-mail has a higher density of incorrect facts than just about\n   anything I've seen.  Below are several more examples.\n  </p><p>\n   \"The cruise liner, Queen Elizabeth II, moves only six inches for each gallon\n   of diesel that it burns.\"\n  </p><p>\n   From <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/319027.stm\">a page of\n   facts about the QE2,</a> we find that the ship consumes 18 tons of fuel per\n   hour at a service speed of 28 knots.  By legislation in many areas, diesel\n   fuel must have a density no higher than 0.85 kg/liter (if it were watered\n   down, it would be higher.)\n  </p><p><code>18 tons/hour / (28 knot) / (.85 kg/liter) -&gt; feet/gallon</code><code>Warning: reciprocal conversion\n    33.52338503156235</code></p><p>\n   They're very, very wrong.  It actually travels about 33.5 feet per gallon,\n   or 157 gallons/mile.  They're only off by a factor of 67.  Still not great\n   gas mileage, though.\n  </p><p>\n   The same e-mail states \"pound for pound, hamburgers cost more than new\n   cars.\"\n  </p><p>\n   Let's see... let's try with a medium-expensive, light car.  A\n   2001 Corvette Z06 weighs 3,115 pounds and costs $48,055.\n  </p><p><code>(48055 dollars) / (3115 lb) -&gt; dollars/lb</code><code>1373/89 (approx. 15.426966292134832)</code></p><p>\n   I know  don't pay $15/lb for hamburger.\n  </p><p>\n   Let's try with a light, very cheap car.  A quick lookup showed that a 2001\n   Hyundai Accent costs $10,184 and weighs 2255 pounds.  That's still $4.51 a\n   pound.  Do  pay that much for hamburger?  Maybe a finished\n   hamburger in a good restaurant, certainly not for hamburger.  This is\n   deceptive if not outright wrong.\n  </p><p>\n   By the way, did you ever notice that in the movie  that\n   Gordie  gets ripped off for hamburger?  Supposedly set in\n   1960, Gordie buys \"a buck and a half of hamburger\" which is slapped down in\n   a tiny wrapper that couldn't contain more than 3/4 of a pound.  Probably a\n   half pound--it looks like all wrapper.  (You estimate it.)  Converting to\n   modern prices:\n  </p><p><code>1.50 dollars_1960 / (.75 lb) -&gt; dollars/lb</code></p><p>\n   Gordie paid a modern equivalent of $27/lb for that hamburger.  Perhaps a\n   smarter shopper  have gotten more for Vern's 7 cents.\n  </p><p>\n   The same e-mail says \"the longest word that can be typed using only the\n   left hand is 'stewardesses'.\"  Well, Frink is good for doing word stuff\n   too.  Using the single word list from the \n   <a href=\"http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/\">Moby wordlist</a>,\n   the following program finds lots of 12-letter alternatives, and several\n   longer:\n  </p><p><code>\n    infile = \"\"</code><code>leftPattern = %r/^[qwertasdfgzxcvb]+$/i</code><code>\n    matches = select[lines[infile], leftPattern]</code><code>\n    sort[matches, { |a,b| length[a] &lt;=&gt; length[b] } ]\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println[length[line] + \": $line\"]\n   </code></p><p>\n   (Actually, my original program was only 2 lines, but this is easier to\n   read.  The program could be written lots of ways.)  Some of the results are:\n  </p><p><code>\n    12: stewardesses\n    12: desegregates\n    12: watercresses\n    12: decerebrated\n    12: desegregated\n    12: tessaradecad\n    12: reaggregated\n    12: reverberates\n    12: aftereffects\n    13: aftercataract\n    17: redrawerredrawers</code></p><p>\n   I have no idea what that last word means.\n  </p><p>\n   So you want to build an ark, do you?  And not an Ark of the Covenant, but\n   the boat.  How bad was that flood?\n  </p><p>\n   The bible is also quite precise in its measurement of the flood.  Genesis\n   7:19-20 states that \"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth;\n   and all the mountains, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\n   Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were\n   covered.\"\n  </p><p>\n   Okay, so the highest mountains of the earth were covered, plus an extra 15\n   cubits (approx 27 feet) for good measure.  The current measurements for\n   highest mountain is Mt. Everest at 29030.8 feet (according to the highly\n   dubious and utterly non-trustable 2002 Guinness Book of World Records.)  I\n   know that Everest is growing slowly, (best estimates are 2.4 inches/year)\n   so we'll discount for that.\n  </p><p><code>\n    depth = 29030 feet + 15 biblicalcubits - (2.4 inches/year 4000 years)\n   </code></p><p>\n   About 28257 feet of water.  This was deposited over 40 days.  The rainfall\n   was thus:\n  </p><p><code>rainfall = depth / (40 days)</code></p><p>\n   Or about 353 inches/hour, or 29 feet/hour.  A good rain around here is\n   about an inch an hour.  The very rainiest places on earth like <a href=\"http://www.extremescience.com/wettest.htm\">Cherrapunji</a>\n   get about this much rain in a .  (I'm campaigning Colorado\n   farmers to sin a bit more...)\n  </p><p>\n   Everyone knows Einstein's E=mc equation, but to apply it is\n   often very difficult because the units come out so strange.  Let's see, I\n   have mass in pounds, and the speed of light is 186,282\n   miles/second... ummm... what does that come out to?  In Frink the\n   calculation becomes transparently simple.\n  </p><p>\n   If you took the matter in a teaspoon of water, and converted that to\n   energy, how many gallons of gasoline would that equal?\n  </p><p><code>teaspoon water c^2 -&gt; \"gallons gasoline\"</code><code>3164209.862836101 gallons gasoline</code></p><p>\n   Unbelievable.  The energy in a teaspoon of water, if we could extract it,\n   is equal to burning more than 3  gallons of gasoline.\n  </p><p>\n   The November 2001 edition of  magazine has a\n   charming article called \"Stellar Guides for Your Birthday\" by Jeff\n   A. Farinacci (p. 63), which provides a list of \"nearby\" stars and their\n   distances in light-years or light-days.  This allows you to look at the\n   light coming from a star that was emitted the day you were born.  It\n   includes a <a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/basic-programs-from-sky-telescope/\">28-line\n   BASIC program, </a> to calculate how many days old\n   you are on a certain date. \n   As you know by now, the essential calculation can be done in one line of\n   Frink.  For example, the bright star Pollux is about 33.7 light-years away\n   (12314 days, based on the Hipparcos satellite's parallax measurement of\n   96.74 milliarcseconds) and the light it emitted on the day I was born will\n   finally reach earth on the date:\n  </p><p><code>#1969-08-19# + 12314 days</code><code>AD 2003-05-07 12:00:00.000 AM (Wed) Mountain Daylight Time</code></p><p>\n   or, to calculate the date directly from the parallax, we can use the\n   following, where  is an astronomical unit (the average\n   distance between the earth and the sun,) and  is the speed of\n   light, the values of which are known to Frink:\n  </p><p><code>#1969-08-19# + au / (96.74 milliarcsec) / c</code></p><p>\n   This gives the same date as the calculation above (May 7, 2003.)  I was\n   amazed to find that the universe has conspired to produce a beautiful\n   conjunction on this date.  Pollux will form a straight line with the moon\n   and Jupiter in the western sky on that night:\n  </p><p>\n   (Note:  The three objects aren't as close together as it may look in this\n   picture.  The sky is big.)  These screenshots show how it will look at 10 PM\n   Mountain Daylight Time.\n  </p><p>\n   Below is a 45-degree chunk of sky looking due west.  This will give you a\n   better idea of how the sky will look as you face west.  You'll probably see\n   Pollux and Castor quite clearly.  Castor is the bright star directly\n   to the right of Pollux.  Castor and Pollux will appear to make a horizontal\n   line at this time.\n  </p><p>\n   It shouldn't be hard to find.  Look west.  The moon will be the brightest\n   object in the sky, and Jupiter will be the second-brightest.  Follow the\n   line from Jupiter to the moon.  Pollux is by far the brightest star along\n   that line (it has a dimmer twin Castor, which will be on the right.)  The\n   moon is in the center and Jupiter and Pollux are equal distances on either\n   side of the moon.  Follow the wise men.  Bring gold.  I already have lots\n   of frankincense and myrrh.\n  </p><p>: This article also underlines one of the\n   things I am growing to miss in most physical equations and all programs\n   written in other languages... the loss of units.  Everything is an\n   unexplained number, and inscrutable conversion factors are strewn liberally\n   throughout.  This is exactly the type of thing that Frink was designed to\n   address.  For example, a line in the article indicates:\n  </p><p><i>The parallax-to-distance formula is simple: d=1/p, where p is the\n    parallax angle in arcseconds and d is the distance in parsecs (3.26\n    light-years).</i></p><p>\n   This description is unfortunate.  1 divided by an angle (which is\n   dimensionless) is still dimensionless,  a distance.  This is\n   better specified by saying that the formula is distance=(orbital\n   radius)/(parallax angle).  Since the parallax angles are specified with\n   respect to Earth's orbital radius, you can write the equation as\n   . \"\" is an astronomical\n   unit, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is included\n   in Frink's standard data file.  Then, p can be specified in \n   angular units and distance can be automatically converted to light-years or\n   light-days instead of parsecs (or into feet, if you want).  As always,\n   <em>Frink makes the units of measurement transparent, and helps to ensure\n   that your calculations make sense.</em> So, using the <a href=\"http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS\">Hipparcos</a>\n   satellite's measurements for the parallax of the closest star, Proxima\n   Centauri (okay, second-closest, smartypants):\n  </p><p><code>au / (.7723 arcsec) -&gt; lightyears</code></p><p>\n   This way, we learn something about the  of the physical\n   calculation which we can generalize, rather than having an equation that\n   only works with one weird system of measurement.  (Although professional\n   astronomers like to use parsecs, I think it's a horrible, intentionally\n   exclusive, geocentric measurement and they're just being difficult.  There\n   was even an article in  a while back which\n   intimated that some astronomers would sneer and giggle at you if you used\n   light-years in a professional publication or speech.)  Using our deeper\n   knowledge, we can see how much more accurate the Hipparcos satellite would\n   be if it were put into Jupiter's orbit, or how accurate its instruments\n   need to be to achieve a certain accuracy in distance measurements.  We've\n   learned something more general.\n  </p><p>\n   Below is the same program as in Sky &amp; Telescope, but more flexible.\n   You can enter the exact second of your birth using <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/frinkdata/dateformats.txt\">any of the date formats that Frink\n   recognizes.</a> You enter the desired age as \"12314 days\" or \"1 billion\n   seconds\" or any other duration.  The program uses the <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/#LeapSeconds\"></a> function to calculate the\n   target date <em>with leap seconds accounted for</em>.  So you don't\n   celebrate on the wrong second within the minute.\n  </p><p><code>\n    birthdate = parseDate[input[\"Enter your birthdate: \"]]\n    str = input[\"Enter desired age: \"]\n    println[\"You will be $str old on \" + addLeap[birthdate,age]]</code></p><p><code>1969-08-19 04:54 PM Mountain</code><code>You will be 1 billion seconds old on AD 2001-04-27\n     06:40:15.653 PM (Fri) Mountain Daylight Time\n   </code></p><p>\n   Now you want your own star, don't you?  You might take a look at a list of\n   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars\">the\n    brightest stars in the sky</a>\n   and look the stars' distances in light-years.  This will give you an idea\n   of the bright stars, and give you their Hipparcos catalog numbers.  Using\n   the Hipparcos catalog number given in that table, you can look up that star\n   from \n   <a href=\"http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS&amp;page=multisearch2\">this\n    Hipparcos search form,</a> find its Geometrical Parallax (field H11, which\n   is probably given in milliarcseconds) and plug that number into the\n   equation shown above.  At some point, I may make a Frink Server Page that\n   automates this.  But you might learn more just by doing the calculations\n   yourself.\n  </p><p>\n   Whether you have a kid who is 8.6 years old (for Sirius which is the\n   brightest star in the sky and 3141 light-days away,) someone turning 11.4\n   (Procyon), turning 16.8 (Altair) or someone turning 65.1 (Aldebaran,) a\n   star is a great gift and  might just start a love of astronomy.  I can't\n   promise that the moon and the planets will line up for ,\n   though.\n  </p><p>\n   Note that there is some uncertainty in measuring parallaxes, often several\n   percent, and thus the dates are somewhat uncertain, so it's a gift you can\n   give  time around the date.  For example, the standard error\n   for the parallax of Pollux is 0.87 milliarcseconds (parallax error is field\n   H16 in the Hipparcos catalog, specified in milliarcseconds) which leads to\n   an actual date that can vary from around January 17, 2003 to August 27,\n   2003 -- a range of over 7 months.  Just have fun and celebrate your stars\n   when you want!\n  </p><p>\n   This one is fun.  I didn't have a grasp of the size difference between the\n   Earth and the Moon so I wanted to make a little scale model in my home.  It\n   would be best to use spheres of the appropriate sizes, but I don't have\n   that many balls.  Instead, I decided to cut circles out of paper.  My\n   deciding dimension was the size of the piece of paper I used to cut out the\n   pieces.  I could only get a 7-inch diameter circle for the Earth (3.5-inch\n   radius), so this defined my scale, which I saved in a variable for use in\n   later calculations:\n  </p><p><code>scale = earthradius / (3.5 inches)</code></p><p>\n   The standard data file contains information about the dimensions of the\n   planets,  being one of those.  Now how big should\n   the Moon circle be?\n  </p><p><code>moonradius / scale -&gt; inches</code></p><p>\n   Okay, using my rolling ruler, I cut out a circle with radius 0.95 inches\n   (diameter 1.9 inches).  There's the Moon.  It's interesting to see the\n   difference in size between the Earth and Moon:\n  </p><p>\n   Now, to place them properly... how far away should they be at that scale?\n  </p><p>\n   Okay, stick the Earth to one wall, and then measure a distance 17.5 feet\n   away, and stick the Moon to that.  </p><p>\n   From each vantage point, you can see how big the other actually looks from\n   that distance.  Standing by the Earth, you can see how big the Moon looks\n   (you've seen the Moon, but it's a smaller angle than you might guess... the\n   Moon really doesn't take up much sky, only about half a degree in\n   diameter.)  You can verify this by holding a fingernail out at arm's\n   length, comparing it to the size of your Moon model, and then going outside\n   and doing the same to the Moon, if you can see it.\n  </p><p>\n   Now walk over to the Moon and look at the Earth.  It would be pretty big!\n   Earth would appear about 3.66 times wider in diameter (in Frink notation,\n   , or 13.4 times larger in area (\n   <code>pi earthradius^2 / (pi moonradius^2)</code> ).\n  </p><p>\n   Just to verify, I wanted to make sure that the visible angles in my model\n   match real life.  The visual angle of an object which does not subtend a\n   large angle can be expressed as .  The\n   angle normally comes out in radians if width and distance are in the same\n   units, but this is Frink.  You can get the answer out in degrees, or\n   arcminutes if that's where your heart lies:\n  </p><p><code>1.9 inches / (17.5 feet) -&gt; arcminutes</code></p><p>\n   Yep, that's just the right number of arcminutes.  From Earth, the Sun and\n   the Moon both appear just over half a degree in diameter, or about 32\n   arcminutes (an arcminute is 1/60 of a degree).  It all works out.  Note\n   that in the standard data file, radians are dimensionless units (a radian\n   is defined as \"1\".)  This is because radians are dimensionless units, but\n   you can convert values in radians to other angular units.\n  </p><p>\n   By the way, a more accurate angular formula that is valid for large\n    small angles subtended by a sphere with a given radius at a\n   specified distance is:\n  </p><p><code>2 arcsin[/( + )] -&gt; degrees</code></p><p>\n   Note that inverse trigonometric functions (,\n   , ) have their output in radians.\n   This is easily converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You\n   don't see that the output is in radians (if you use the standard data file)\n   because radians are dimensionless numbers.  You just gotta be a bit careful\n   here, or make the minor change in your units file to make radians a\n   fundamental dimension.  (Read the documentation in the units file... the\n   units file is otherwise radians-correct.)\n  </p><p> I remember a cool black-and-white movie we saw\n   in my Kindergarten class about making a scale model of the solar system.\n   It involved a  vertical circular sign representing the Sun\n   that somebody had built for the film and a car driving a measured distance\n   away to look at it.  (A bit confusing, though.  I remember them saying\n   \"here we are, 93 million miles away!\" and they were still in the same\n   park.)  Good stuff, and I'm glad I finally made my own model.  It helps me\n   understand how cool the Apollo missions were.  But my enthusiasm is\n   tempered by the fact that I'm just now figuring out stuff they tried to\n   teach me in Kindergarten.\n  </p><p>\n   Now go make your own model.  Pick your own scale to fit your surroundings\n   and materials.  It's fun.  In my model, Jupiter would have to\n   be a sphere 6.59 feet in diameter, placed about 5.5 miles away right now.\n   I'll have to get a bigger place.\n  </p><p>\n   Now that you know how to calculate the size in Frink yourself, I've gone\n   ahead and built a Frink Server Page that lets you\n   <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/solar.fsp\"></a></p><p>  In your model, figure and/or plot the following:\n  </p><ul><li>Orbit of the Space Shuttle (about 300 km above the surface of the\n    Earth)  Wow.

Specifically, thruster\n    performance data in English units instead of metric units was used in the\n    software application code titled SM_FORCES (small forces).\" --<a href=\"ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/reports/1999/MCO_report.pdf\">Mars\n    Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board, Phase I Report</a></p></blockquote><p>\n   This is not to take away from the designers of a wonderfully complex\n   spacecraft that can travel to Mars; that's an incredibly difficult problem,\n   and I couldn't do it.  However, this is just the type of error that Frink\n   was designed to help avoid, and because  make these type of\n   errors a lot, I've designed this tool to help me.  Frink tracks units\n   through  calculations and makes conversions between them\n   transparent.  This is why I'm working toward making Frink a feasible\n   solution for calculations of this type.\n  </p><blockquote><p>\n    \"I ran across Frink, and as a member of the MCO review board, I\n    appreciate your efforts.  Note, however that more than just language\n    support is necessary.  First, you'd have to have conventions on data\n    I/O -- the misinterpreted data was from a file, not from another\n    function in the program.  Also, there was an issue of software reuse\n    -- the errant portion of the system had been used before on a previous\n    mission, and in that case it was used in a non-critical,\n    non-navigational way.  It was not properly reviewed because the team\n    did not realize that in MCO it became critical.\"\n   </p></blockquote><p>\n   The points above are well-taken.  Proper parsing of units can be easily\n   achieved in Frink with a simple, appropriate comment in the data file. <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=unittable.frink\">unittable.frink</a> shows\n   how Frink can parse a file containing units of measure.  All that is needed\n   is to add a  to the data file that contains the\n   units of measure of each data column.  Frink then reads each column with\n   the appropriate units of measure and scale, using any units of measure that\n   Frink knows about as input, and Frink parses them and works with them\n   properly.  See its <a href=\"https://frinklang.org/unittable.txt\">sample data file</a>.\n  </p><p>\n   Frink and its  function could always trivially handle\n   the case where each number in a file has its units of measure specified\n   with the number, e.g. \"\".  That's literally\n    effort to parse with Frink, and is slightly less compact, but\n   that's a very small price to pay, compared to mission failure.\n  </p><p>\n   Of course, there's no simple solution for someone completely not reading\n   the specification documents, but the fact that a file completely omits any\n   units of measure would be a good warning flag to double-check your sources,\n   I'm growing to fear and avoid any system that treats every physical\n   measurement as an unexplained dimensionless number, as most programming\n   languages have for the past few decades.  We can do better.\n  </p><p>\n   Keep in mind that the syntax represented in this document \n   change as Frink evolves.  The current parser just makes it easier for me to\n   test certain features, and I intentionally refuse to spend a lot of time on\n   it at this point.

In a <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/news-updates/uspto-rescinds-memorandum-addressing-discretionary-denial-procedures\">memo released February 28</a>, the USPTO further restricted access to inter partes review, or IPR—the process Congress created to let the public challenge invalid patents without having to wage million-dollar court battles.</p><p>If left unchecked, this decision will shield bad patents from scrutiny, embolden patent trolls, and make it even easier for hedge funds and large corporations to weaponize weak patents against small businesses and developers.</p><h3><strong>IPR Exists Because the Patent Office Makes Mistakes</strong></h3><p>Congress created IPR in 2012 to fix this problem. IPR allows anyone to challenge a patent’s validity based on prior art, and it’s done before specialized judges at the USPTO, where experts can re-evaluate whether a patent was properly granted. It’s faster, cheaper, and often fairer than fighting it out in federal court.</p><h3><strong>The USPTO is Blocking Patent Challenges—Again</strong></h3><p>Instead of defending IPR, the USPTO is working to sabotage it. The February 28 memo reinstates a rule that allows for widespread use of “discretionary denials.” That’s when the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) refuses to hear an IPR case for procedural reasons—even if the patent is likely invalid.&nbsp;</p><p>The February 28 memo reinstates widespread use of the <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/IPR2020-00019,%20Apple%20v.%20Fintiv,%20Paper%2011%20(3.20.20).pdf\"> rule</a>, under which the USPTO often rejected IPR petitions whenever there’s an ongoing district court case about the same patent. This is backwards.

For the past 6 months I've been working on an open source python library that implements differentiable geometric optics in PyTorch. It's very experimental still, but eventually the goal is to use it to design optical systems with a state of the art optimization framework and a beautiful code based API. Think OpenSCAD, but for optical systems.</p><p>Not only is PyTorch's autograd an amazing general purpose optimizer, but torch.nn (the neural network building blocks) can be used pretty much out of the box to model an optical system. This is because there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in a so-called sequential optical system. So the magic is that we can stack lenses as if we were stacking Conv2D and ReLu layers and everything works out. Instead of Conv2D you have ray-surface collision detection, instead of ReLu you have the law of refraction. Designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network.</p><p>You should be able to `pip install torchlensmaker` to try it out, but I just set it up so let me know if there's any trouble.</p><p>I was part of the Winter 1'24 batch at the Recurse Center (<a href=\"https://www.recurse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.recurse.com/</a>) working on this project pretty much full time.

Yes, you might discover that a Senior FPA Analyst II earns the same as a Product Marketing Director I, but why does that matter?&nbsp; It’s a coincidence.&nbsp; It’s like saying with $3.65 I can buy either a grande non-fat latte or a head of organic lettuce.&nbsp; What matters is the fair price of each of those goods in the market — not they that happen to have the same price.&nbsp; So I object to the whole notion of levels across the organization. &nbsp;It’s not canonical; it’s coincidence.</li></ul><ul><li>Most leveling systems are too granular, with the levels separated by arbitrary characterizations. It’s makework.&nbsp; It’s fake science.&nbsp; It’s bureaucratic and encourages a non-thinking “climb the ladder” approach to career development.&nbsp; (“Hey, let’s develop you to go from somewhat-independent to rather-independent this year.”)</li></ul><ul><li>It conflates career development and salary negotiation. It encourages a mindset of saying, “what must I do to make L10” when you want to say, “I want a $10K raise.”&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times people have asked me for “development” or “leveling” conversations where I get excited and start talking about learning, skills gaps, and such and it’s clear all they wanted to talk about was salary.&nbsp; Disappointing.</li></ul><p>That said, I do believe there are three meaningful levels in management and it’s important to understand the differences among them.&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times someone has sincerely asked me, “what does it take to be a director?” or, “how can I develop myself into a VP?”</p><p>It’s a hard question.&nbsp; You can turn to the leveling system for an answer, but it’s not in there.&nbsp; For years, in fact, I’ve struggled to find what I consider to be a good answer to the question.</p><p>I’m not talking about Senior VP vs. Executive VP or Director vs. Senior Director.&nbsp; I view such adjectives as window dressing or <a href=\"https://www.englishclub.com/ref/esl/Idioms/E/earn_your_stripes_162.htm\">stripes</a>:&nbsp; important recognition along the way, but nothing that fundamentally changes one’s level.</p><p>I’m not talking about how many people you manage.&nbsp; In call centers, a director might manage 500 people.&nbsp; In startups, a VP might manage zero.</p><p>I am talking about one of three levels at which people operate:&nbsp; manager, director, and vice president.&nbsp; Here are my definitions:</p><ul><li><strong>Managers are paid to drive results with some support</strong>. They have experience in the function, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support.&nbsp; They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision</strong> (“set and forget”). Directors know how to do the job.&nbsp; They can make a project’s tactical plan in their sleep.&nbsp; They can work across the organization to get it done.&nbsp; I love strong directors.&nbsp; They get shit done.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>VPs are paid to make the plan</strong>. Say you run marketing.&nbsp; Your job is to understand the company’s business situation, make a plan to address it, build consensus to get approval of that plan, and then go execute it.</li></ul><p>The biggest single development issue I’ve seen over the years is that many VPs still think like directors. [1]</p><p>Say the plan didn’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp; “But, we executed the plan we agreed to,” they might say, hoping to play a get-out-of-jail-free card with the CEO (which is about to boomerang).</p><p>Of course, the VP got approval to execute the plan. &nbsp;Otherwise, you’d be having a different conversation, one about termination for insubordination.</p><p>But the plan didn’t work.&nbsp; Because directors are primarily execution engines, they can successfully play this card.&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; Good directors challenge their plans to make them better.&nbsp; But they can still play the approval&nbsp;card successfully because their primary duty is to execute the plan, not make it.</p><p>VP’s, however, cannot play the approval card. &nbsp;The VP’s job is to get the right answer. &nbsp;They are the functional expert.&nbsp; No one on the team knows their function better than they do.&nbsp; And even if someone did, they are still playing the VP of function role and it’s their job – and no one else’s — to get the right answer.</p><p>Now, you might be thinking, “glad I don’t work for Dave” right now — he’s putting failure of a plan to which he and the team agreed on the back of the VP.&nbsp; And I am.</p><p>But it’s the same standard to which the CEO is held.&nbsp; If the CEO makes a plan, gets it approved by the board, and executes it well but it doesn’t work, they cannot tell the board “but, but, it’s the plan we agreed to.”&nbsp; Most CEOs wouldn’t even dream of saying that.&nbsp; It’s because CEOs understand they are held accountable not for effort or activity, but results.</p><p>Part of truly operating at the VP level is to internalize this fact.&nbsp; You are accountable for results.&nbsp; Make a plan that you believe in.&nbsp; Because if the plan doesn’t work, you can’t hide behind approval.&nbsp; Your job was to make a plan that worked.&nbsp; If the risk of dying on a hill is inevitable, you may as well die on your own hill, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Paraphrasing the ancient <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHug0AIhVoQ\">Fram oil filter commercial</a>, I call this “you can fire me now or fire me later” principle.&nbsp; An executive should never sign up for a plan they don’t believe in.&nbsp; They should risk being fired now for refusing to sign up for the plan (e.g., challenging assumptions, delivering bad news) as opposed to halfheartedly executing a plan they don’t believe in and almost certainly getting fired for its failure later. &nbsp;The former is a far better way to go than the latter.</p><p>This is important not only because it prepares the VP to one day become a&nbsp; CEO, but also because it empowers the VP in making their plan.&nbsp; If this my plan, if I am to be judged on its success or failure, if I am not able to use approval as a get-out-of-jail-free card, then is it the right plan?</p><p>That’s the thinking I want to stimulate. &nbsp;That’s how great VPs think.</p><p>[1] Since big companies throw around the VP title pretty casually, this post is arguing that many of those VPs are actually directors in thinking and accountability. &nbsp;This may be one reason why big company VPs have trouble adapting to the e-staff of startups.</p>","contentLength":6966,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43434093"},{"title":"A well calculated addition to the lab","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1jgdf9g/a_well_calculated_addition_to_the_lab/","date":1742551838,"author":"/u/retrohaz3","guid":715,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I nabbed three DS60 CYAEs for $30 AUD each at the local tip shop today.

But the reality? It’s a meat grinder that chews up developers,\n            sysadmins,\n            and\n            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.\n        </p><p>\n            We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,\n            demanding\n            80\n            hour weeks under the guise of \"passion.\" And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the\n            constant\n            threat\n            of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and\n            unless we\n            start\n            organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.\n        </p><p>\n            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In\n            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say\n            it’s\n            about\n            \"responding to change over following a plan,\" but let’s be honest - it’s about dangling\n            more\n            carrots\n            and keeping\n            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we’re the ones paying the\n            price.\n\n        </p><p>\n            And then there’s burnout. We’re in an industry where burnout isn’t just common -\n            it’s\n            expected. If you’re not\n            pulling all-nighters, you’re \"not committed.\" If you’re not answering Slack messages at\n            midnight,\n            you’re \"not a\n            team player.\" This culture is toxic, and it’s only getting worse. The relentless churn of\n            projects,\n            the\n            constant\n            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And\n            what’s\n            the industry’s solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.\n        </p><p>\n            Let’s talk about job security - because there isn’t any. The tech industry loves to hype itself\n            as a\n            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it’s a meat market. As\n            soon\n            as\n            you’re not \"on the cutting edge,\" you’re out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy\n            bullshit -\n            it’s all\n            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that\n            we’ll\n            have a\n            job next week, next month, or next year.\n        </p><p>\n            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us\n            disposable. Permanent employment? That’s for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when\n            they\n            can\n            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don’t get me started on those\n            non-compete\n            clauses\n            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.\n        </p><p>\n            And let’s not forget the ethical side of this equation. We’re being asked to build the future,\n            to\n            develop AI,\n            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?\n            How\n            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data\n            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don’t have the power to say no?\n        </p><p>\n            That’s the kicker. We’re the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it’s\n            built. We don’t get\n            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we’re isolated, as long as\n            we’re afraid\n            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.\n        </p><p>\n            This industry isn’t going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren’t going to suddenly\n            grow a\n            conscience,\n            and they aren’t going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from\n            organizing,\n            from\n            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.\n        </p><p>\n            Unionizing isn’t just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).\n            It’s\n            about taking\n            back some control. It’s about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we’re\n            treated.\n            It’s about\n            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.\n        </p><p>\n            And don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?\n            They’re\n            showing us it can\n            be done. They’re standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,\n            \"Enough.\" We\n            need\n            more of\n            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are\n            profiting off our sweat and tears.\n        </p><p>\n            Hackers, we’ve always been about more than just code. We’ve been about freedom - freedom of\n            information, freedom\n            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It’s about taking the hacker ethos into the\n            workplace,\n            about\n            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.\n        </p><ul><li> Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to\n                organizing is\n                realizing you’re not alone.\n            </li><li><strong>Support Existing Efforts:</strong> If you’re in a company where union efforts are already\n                underway, get\n                involved.\n                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.\n            </li><li> We’re hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to\n                organize without\n                being\n                detected. Let’s use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the\n                powers that\n                be.</li><li> Let’s make sure that any union platform we build isn’t\n                just about wages and\n                hours, but\n                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we’re building and how it’s used.</li></ul><p>\n            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don’t do something soon, we’re going to get run\n            over. The\n            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it’s all going to keep getting worse unless we take a\n            stand.\n            Unionizing isn’t just a nice idea - it’s a necessity.\n        </p><p>\n            So let’s do what hackers do best: let’s disrupt. Let’s take the tools they’ve given\n            us, the skills we’ve\n            honed, and use them to build something better. Let’s unionize.

I’m Tony, co-founder of Inngest. I wanted to share AgentKit, our Typescript multi-agent library we’ve been cooking and testing with some early users in prod for months.</p><p>Although  OpenAI’s Agents SDK has been launched since, we think an Agent framework should offer more deterministic and flexible routing, work with multiple model providers, embrace MCP (for rich tooling), and support the unstoppable and growing community of TypeScript AI developers by enabling a smooth transition to production use cases.</p><p>This is why we are building AgentKit, and we’re really excited about it for a few reasons:</p><p>Firstly, it’s simple. We embrace KISS principles brought by Anthropic and HuggingFace by allowing you to gradually add autonomy to your AgentKit program using primitives:</p><p>- Agents: LLM calls that can be combined with prompts, tools, and MCP native support.</p><p>- Networks: a simple way to get Agents to collaborate with a shared State, including handoff.</p><p>- State: combines conversation history with a fully typed state machine, used in routing.</p><p>- Routers: where the autonomy lives, from code-based to LLM-based (ex: ReAct) orchestration</p><p>The routers are where the magic happens, and allow you to build deterministic, reliable, testable agents.</p><p>AgentKit routing works as follows: the network calls itself in a loop, inspecting the State to determine which agents to call next using a router.  The returned agent runs, then optionally updates state data using its tools.  On the next loop, the network inspects state data and conversation history, and determines which new agent to run.</p><p>This fully typed state machine routing allows you to deterministically build agents using any of the effective agent patterns — which means your code is easy to read, edit, understand, and debug.</p><p>This also makes handoff incredibly easy: you define when agents should hand off to each other using regular code and state (or by calling an LLM in the router for AI-based routing). This is similar to the OpenAI Agents SDK but easier to manage, plan, and build.</p><p>Then comes the local development and moving to production capabilities.</p><p>AgentKit is compatible with Inngest’s tooling, meaning that you can test agents using Inngest’s local DevServer, which provides traces, inputs, outputs, replay, tool, and MCP inputs and outputs, and (soon) a step-over debugger so that you can easily understand and visually see what's happening in the agent loop.</p><p>In production, you can also optionally combine AgentKit with Inngest for fault-tolerant execution.  Each agent’s LLM call is wrapped in a step, and tools can use multiple steps to incorporate things like human-in-the-loop.  This gives you native orchestration, observability, and out-of-the-box scale.</p><p>You will find the documentation as an example of an AgentKit SWE-bench and multiple Coding Agent examples.</p><p>It’s fully open-source under the Apache 2 license.</p><p>If you want to get started:</p><p>- npm: npm i @inngest/agent-kit</p><p>We’re excited to finally launch AgentKit; let us know what you think!</p>","contentLength":3023,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43426164"},{"title":"Claude can now search the web","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search","date":1742489472,"author":"meetpateltech","guid":189,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43425655"},{"title":"FOSS infrastructure is under attack by AI companies","url":"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/","date":1742475049,"author":"todsacerdoti","guid":188,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Three days ago, Drew DeVault - founder and CEO of SourceHut - published a blogpost called, \"Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my face\", where he complained that LLM companies were crawling data without respecting robosts.txt and causing severe outages to SourceHut.</p><p>I went, \"Interesting!\", and moved on.</p><p>Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers.</p><p>I then discovered that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it's the default loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI scrapers that are causing outages.</p><p>By now, it should be pretty clear that this is no coincidence. AI scrapers are getting more and more aggressive, and - since FOSS software relies on public collaboration, whereas private companies don't have that requirement - this is putting some extra burden on Open Source communities.</p><p>So let's try to get more details – going back to Drew's blogpost. According to Drew, LLM crawlers don't respect robots.txt requirements and include expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in your repository. They do so using random User-Agents from tens of thousands of IP addresses, each one making no more than one HTTP request, trying to blend in with user traffic.</p><p>Due to this, it's hard to come off with a good set of mitigations. Drew says that several high-priority tasks have been delayed for weeks or months due to these interruptions, users have been occasionally affected (because it's hard to distinguish bots and humans), and - of course - this causes occasional outages of SourceHut.</p><p>Drew here does not distinguish between which AI companies are more or less respectful of robots.txt files, or more accurate in their user agent reporting; we'll be able to look more into that later.</p><p>Finally, Drew points out that this is not some isolated issue. He says, </p><blockquote>All of my sysadmin friends are dealing with the same problems, [and] every time I sit down for beers or dinner to socialize with sysadmin friends it's not long before we're complaining about the bots. [...] The desperation in these conversations is palpable.</blockquote><p>Which brings me back to yesterday's KDE GitLab issues. According to Ben, part of the KDE sysadmin team, all of the IPs that were performing this DDoS were claiming to be MS Edge, and were due to Chinese AI companies; he mentions that Western LLM operators, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, were at least setting a proper UA - again, more on this later.</p><p>The solution - for now - was to ban the version of Edge that the bots were claiming to be, though it's hard to believe that this will be a definitive solution; these bots do seem keen on changing user agents to try to blend in as much as possible.</p><p>Indeed, GNOME has been experiencing issues since a last November; as a temporary solution they had rate-limited non-logged in users from seeing merge requests and commits, which obviously also caused issues for real human guests.</p><p>The solution the eventually settled to was switching to Anubis. This is a page that presents a challenge to the browser, which then has to spend time doing some math and presenting the solution back to the server. If it's right, you get access to the website.</p><p>According to the developer, this project is \"a bit of a nuclear response, but AI scraper bots scraping so aggressively have forced my hand. I hate that I have to do this, but this is what we get for the modern Internet because bots don't conform to standards like robots.txt, even when they claim to\".</p><p>However, this is also causing user issues. When a lot of people open the link from the same place, it might happen that they get served some higher-difficulty exercise that will take some time to complete; there's one user reporting one minute delay, and another - from his phone - having to wait around two minutes.</p><p>Why? Well, a GitLab link was pasted in a chatroom! Similarly, the same happened when the Triple Buffering GNOME merge request was posted to Hacker News, and thus received a lot of attention over there. As the developer said, it's a nuclear option for crawlers, but it also has human consequences.</p><p>Over Mastodon, one GNOME sysadmin, Bart Piotrowski, kindly shared some numbers to let people fully understand the scope of the problem. According to him, in around two hours and a half they received 81k total requests, and out of those only 3% passed Anubi's proof of work, hinting at 97% of the traffic being bots – an insane number!</p><p>That said, at least  worked. Other organizations are having a harder time dealing with these scrapers.</p><p>As an example, here's Jonathan Corbet, who runs the FOSS news source LWN, warns users that the website might be \"occasionally sluggish\"… due to DDoS from AI scraper bots. He claims that \"only a small fraction of our traffic is serving actual human readers\", and at some point, the bots \"decides to hit us from hundreds of IP addresses at once. [..] They don't identify themselves as bots, and robots.txt is the only thing they don't read off the site\".</p><p>Many expressed solidarity, including Kevin Fenzi, sysadmin for the Fedora project. They've also been having issues with AI scrapers: firstly, one month ago they had to fight to get pagure.io to stay alive:</p><p>However, things got  over time, so they had to block a bunch of subnets, which has also impacted many real users. Out of desperation, at one point Kevin decided to ban the entire country of Brazil to get things to work again; to my understanding, this ban is still in effect, and it's not so clear where a longer-term solution might be found.</p><p>And, as Neal Gompa points out, even this blocking an entire country only gets you so far, and apparently the Fedora infrastructure has been \"regularly down for weeks\" because of AI scrapers.</p><p>Another project that's been hit by this issue  is Inkscape. According to Martin Owens, it's not \"the usual Chinese DDoS from last year, but from a pile of companies that started ignoring our spider conf and started spoofing their browser info. I now have a Prodigius block list. If you happen to work for a big company doing AI, you may not get our website anymore\".</p><p>And, well, Martin is not the only developer who has built a \"prodigious block list\". Even BigGrizzly from Frama software was flooded by a bad LLM crawler, and built a list of 460K IPs with spoofed user agents to ban; he's offering to share the list around.</p><p>One more comprehensive attempt at this is the \"ai.robots.txt\" project, an open list of web crawlers associated with AI companies. They offer a robots.txt that implements the Robots Exclusion Protocol and a .htaccess file that will return an error page when getting a request from any AI crawler in their list.</p><p>We can get some more numbers about the crawlers if we go a few months back. Here's a post by Dennis Schubert about the Diaspora (an Open Source decentralized social network) infrastructure, where he says that \"looking at the traffic logs made him impressively angry\".</p><p>In the blogpost, he claims that one fourth of his entire web traffic is due to bots with an OpenAI user agent, 15% is due to Amazon, 4.3% is due to Anthropic, and so on. Overall, we're talking about 70% of the entire requests being from AI companies.</p><blockquote>they don’t just crawl a page once and then move on. Oh, no, they come back every 6 hours because lol why not. They also don’t give a single flying fuck about , because why should they. [...] If you try to rate-limit them, they’ll just switch to other IPs all the time. If you try to block them by User Agent string, they’ll just switch to a non-bot UA string (no, really). This is literally a DDoS on the entire internet.</blockquote><p>A similar number is given by the Read the Docs project. In a blogpost called, \"AI crawlers need to be more respectful\", they claim that blocking  AI crawlers immediately decreased their traffic by 75%, going from 800GB/day to 200GB/day. This made the project save up around $1500 a month.</p><p>The rest of the article is pretty impressive too; they talk about crawlers downloading tens of terabytes of data within a few days, or more. It's hard to block them entirely, since they use various different IPs.</p><p>I do wonder how much of this is scraping for training data, and how much instead is the \"search\" function that most LLMs provide; nonetheless, according to Schubert, \"normal\" crawlers such as Google's and Bing's only add up to a fraction of a single percentage point, which hints at the fact that other companies are indeed abusing their web powers.</p><p>But it's not just scrapers, or I would've titled this \"AI scrapers\", not \"AI companies\". Another issue that Open Source community have been fighting with is AI-generated bug reports, as an example.</p><p>This was first reported by Daniel Stenberg of the Curl project, in a blogpost titled \"The I in LLM stands for Intelligence\". Curl offers a bug bounty project, but lately, they've noticed that many bug reports are generated by AI. These look credible and take up a lot of developer time to check, but they also contain the typical hallucinations you'd expect from AIs. </p><p>It's pretty crazy to have to go through your own code because a bug report confidently tells you there's some critical security issue to fix, and … not finding it, because the whole issue is just AI hallucination.</p><p>A similar issue was reported by Seth Larson, who's on the security report triage team for CPython, pip, urllib3, Requests, and more. He says,</p><blockquote>Recently I've noticed an uptick in extremely low-quality, spammy, and LLM-hallucinated security reports to open source projects. The issue is in the age of LLMs, these reports appear at first-glance to be potentially legitimate and thus require time to refute.</blockquote><p>This is a pretty big issue. As he points out, responding to security reports is expensive, and responding to invented but credible bug reports causes some significant additional burden on maintainers, which might drive them out of the Open Source world.</p><p>The article ends with a request: please, do not use AI or LLM systems for detecting vulnerabilities. He says, \"These systems today cannot understand code, finding security vulnerabilities requires understanding code AND understanding human-level concepts like intent, common usage, and context.\".</p><p>Again, I want to point out that these issues impact disproportionately on the FOSS world; not only do Open Source projects often have less resources compared to commercial products, but - being community-driven projects - much more of their infrastructure is public and thus susceptible to both crawlers and AI-generated bug reports or issues. </p>","contentLength":10751,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422413"},{"title":"The Frontend Treadmill","url":"https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/","date":1742473531,"author":"Kerrick","guid":187,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A lot of frontend teams are very convinced that rewriting their frontend will lead to the promised land. And I am the bearer of bad tidings.</p><p>If you are building a product that you hope has longevity, your frontend framework is the least interesting technical decision for you to make. And all of the time you spend arguing about it is wasted energy.</p><p>If your product is still around in 5 years, you’re doing great and you should feel successful. But guess what? Whatever framework you choose will be obsolete in 5 years. That’s just how the frontend community has been operating, and I don’t expect it to change soon. Even the popular frameworks that are still around are completely different. Because change is the name of the game. So they’re gonna rewrite their shit too and just give it a new version number.</p><p>Product teams that are smart are getting off the treadmill. Whatever framework you currently have, start investing in getting to know it deeply. Learn the tools until they are not an impediment to your progress. That’s the only option. Replacing it with a shiny new tool is a trap.</p><p>I also wanna give a piece of candid advice to engineers who are searching for jobs. If you feel strongly about what framework you want to use, please make that a criteria for your job search. Please stop walking into teams and derailing everything by trying to convince them to switch from framework X to your framework of choice. It’s really annoying and tremendously costly.</p><p>I always have to start with the cynical take. It’s just how I am. But I do want to talk about what I think should be happening instead.</p><p>Companies that want to reduce the cost of their frontend tech becoming obsoleted so often should be looking to get back to fundamentals. Your teams should be working closer to the web platform with a lot less complex abstractions. We need to relearn what the web is capable of and go back to that.</p><p>Let’s be clear, I’m not suggesting this is strictly better and the answer to all of your problems. I’m suggesting this as an intentional business tradeoff that I think provides more value and is less costly in the long run. I believe if you stick closer to core web technologies, you’ll be better able to hire capable engineers in the future without them convincing you they can’t do work without rewriting millions of lines of code.</p><p>And if you’re an engineer, you will be able to retain much higher market value over time if you dig into and understand core web technologies. I was here before react, and I’ll be here after it dies. You may trade some job marketability today. But it does a lot more for career longevity than trying to learn every new thing that gets popular. And you see how quickly they discarded us when the market turned anyway. Knowing certain tech won’t save you from those realities.</p><p>I couldn’t speak this candidly about this stuff when I held a management role. People can’t help but question my motivations and whatever agenda I may be pushing. Either that or I get into a lot of trouble with my internal team because they think I’m talking about them. But this is just what I’ve seen play out after doing this for 20+ years. And I feel like we need to be able to speak plainly.</p><p>This has been brewing in my head for a long time. The frontend ecosystem is kind of broken right now. And it’s frustrating to me for a few different reasons. New developers are having an extremely hard time learning enough skills to be gainfully employed. They are drowning in this complex garbage and feeling really disheartened. As a result, companies are finding it more difficult to do basic hiring. The bar is so high just to get a regular dev job. And everybody loses.</p><p>What’s even worse is that I believe a lot of this energy is wasted. People that are learning the current tech ecosystem are absolutely not learning web fundamentals. They are too abstracted away. And when the stack changes again, these folks are going to be at a serious disadvantage when they have to adapt away from what they learned. It’s a deep disservice to people’s professional careers, and it’s going to cause a lot of heartache later.</p><p>On a more personal note, this is frustrating to me because I think it’s a big part of why we’re seeing the web stagnate so much. I still run into lots of devs who are creative and enthusiastic about building cool things. They just can’t. They are trying and failing because the tools being recommended to them are just not approachable enough. And at the same time, they’re being convinced that learning fundamentals is a waste of time because it’s so different from what everybody is talking about.</p><p>I guess I want to close by stating my biases. I’m a web guy. I’ve been bullish on the web for 20+ years, and I will continue to be. I think it is an extremely capable and unique platform for delivering software. And it has only gotten better over time while retaining an incredible level of backwards compatibility. The underlying tools we have are dope now. But our current framework layer is working against the grain instead of embracing the platform.</p>","contentLength":5133,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422162"}],"tags":["dev"]}
