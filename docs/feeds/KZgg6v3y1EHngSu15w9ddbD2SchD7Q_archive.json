may have: three hobbies, a short bio.</p></li><li><p>Another user may have: two hobbies, multiple addresses and favorite sports.</p></li></ul><p>If you try to represent these fields in a traditional relational database, you might need several tables and constant schema changes each time you add or modify a field.</p><p>With a flexible schema, you can simply update the document structure on the fly. To achieve this, you need a database that can adapt to changing fields quickly.</p><h4>Recommended Databases - <strong>Document Database</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>MongoDB: </strong>Stores data in JSON-like documents, making it highly flexible and intuitive for developers. Ideal for use cases like social networks, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Couchbase: </strong>Combines flexible JSON-based document storage with high-performance key-value operations. Provides strong support for offline-first applications, with built-in synchronization features.</p></li></ul><h2>3. Needs Caching</h2><p><strong>Caching</strong> is a powerful technique that improves application performance by storing frequently accessed data in a high-speed storage layer&#8212;typically in memory.</p><p>This allows future requests for the same data to be served much faster, bypassing the need for time-consuming queries to slower, disk-based databases or external systems..</p><div

File Storage</h2><p>Many modern applications need to efficiently store and serve media files&#8212;such as images, videos, audio, or other large binary objects.</p><p>For Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Streaming Platforms</strong>: Services like YouTube or Netflix store and deliver massive amounts of video content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Media</strong>: Platforms like Instagram and Facebook manage billions of user-uploaded images and videos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image Hosting Services</strong>: Smaller-scale platforms also require reliable storage and fast delivery for user-uploaded content.</p></li></ul><p>While traditional relational or NoSQL databases can store binary data as <strong>BLOBs (Binary Large Objects)</strong>, they are not optimized for such use cases due to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Storing large binary files in databases increases storage costs and complexity, especially as the data grows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Serving media files directly from a database introduces latency and slows down overall system performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cost</strong>: Databases often charge based on storage and throughput, making them less cost-effective for handling large files.</p></li></ol><p>For these reasons, dedicated <strong>object storage</strong> solutions, often combined with <strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</strong>, are the preferred approach.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2

Highly Connected Data</h2><p>In many systems, data isn&#8217;t just a collection of rows and columns&#8212;it&#8217;s a <strong>web of interconnected entities</strong>. </p><p>In such cases, the relationships between entities are as important as, or sometimes even more critical than, the entities themselves. This is what we call <strong>highly connected data</strong>.</p><p>For Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Social Networks</strong>: Platforms like Facebook analyze relationships to suggest friends, identify communities, and calculate mutual connections or shortest paths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recommendation Systems</strong>: E-commerce platforms like Amazon recommend products based on user behavior and connections between users, items, and categories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge Graphs</strong>: Search engines or content platforms connect concepts to deliver enriched, contextual results.</p></li></ul><p>While traditional relational databases can model relationships using foreign keys and join operations, they fall short in handling highly connected data due to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Complex Queries</strong>: Multi-hop queries, such as &#8220;friends of friends of friends,&#8221; become cumbersome and slow in an RDBMS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Traversing deeply connected relationships often involves costly joins, which degrade performance as the dataset grows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rigid Schema</strong>: Relational databases require a predefined schema, making it harder to adapt to dynamic or evolving relationships.</p></li></ol><h4>Recommended Database -

Metrics Data and Time Series</h2><p><strong>Time series data</strong> consists of sequential data points, each associated with a timestamp, representing how a system, process, or metric evolves over time. </p><p>Examples include CPU usage, request latencies, error rates, stock prices, temperature readings, or user activity logs.</p><p>These datasets often arrive at high frequencies, requiring efficient ingestion, storage, and retrieval for both <strong>real-time monitoring</strong> and <strong>historical trend analysis.</strong></p><p>Although you can store time series data in relational databases or NoSQL solutions, it&#8217;s <strong>not always optimal</strong>.</p><h4>Recommended Databases:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Time Series Databases (TSDBs): </strong>Purpose-built for time series data, these databases provide optimized storage, indexing, and query capabilities for time-based data.</p><ul><li><p><strong>InfluxDB</strong>: Designed explicitly for time series data and offers powerful query features.</p></li><li><p><strong>TimescaleDB</strong>: Built on top of PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB extends relational database capabilities with time series features.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wide-Column Databases: </strong>For scenarios requiring distributed scalability and high write throughput, wide-column stores can also handle time series data effectively.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong>: Supports high-velocity writes and distributed architecture, making it suitable for time series workloads.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>8. Analytics on Ever-Growing Data</h2><p>In scenarios where you're tasked with analyzing massive and ever-growing datasets&#8212;often scaling to terabytes or even petabytes&#8212;you need databases optimized for high-performance analytics.</p><p>These use cases typically involve complex queries, large aggregations, reporting, or feeding data into machine learning pipelines.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>E-commerce platforms</strong> analyzing user behavior, purchase trends, and inventory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social media platforms</strong> deriving insights from billions of user interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>IoT systems</strong> processing sensor data from millions of devices.</p></li></ul><p>Handling these workloads requires databases designed for fast reads and aggregations, even as data continues to grow exponentially.</p><h4>Recommended Databases:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Columnar Databases</strong>: These databases store data in a columnar format, making them ideal for analytical queries that scan and aggregate large datasets.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Amazon Redshift</strong>: Fully managed and highly scalable, supports SQL-based analytics with seamless integration into the AWS ecosystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snowflake</strong>: A cloud-native, multi-cluster data warehouse offering separate compute and storage scaling for high flexibility and performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google BigQuery</strong>: Serverless and highly scalable, ideal for real-time analytics and ad hoc queries on massive datasets.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wide-Column Stores</strong>: These databases are well-suited for analytical workloads that demand high write throughput.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong>: Designed for distributed scalability and high write performance, commonly used in real-time analytics pipelines.</p></li><li><p><strong>HBase</strong>: Built on top of Hadoop, ideal for low-latency random reads and writes, often used in conjunction with Hadoop ecosystems for big data analytics.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>9. Spatial Data</h2><p>Spatial data refers to any data that describes a location, shape, or boundary on Earth. This typically involves storing <strong>latitude and longitude</strong> coordinates (for points) or polygons (for areas).</p><p>If your application relies on <strong>where</strong> as much as <strong>what,</strong> you'll need a database that natively supports spatial data types and queries.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>ride-sharing service</strong> like Uber needs to find nearby drivers and calculate distances in real time.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>food delivery service</strong> like Swiggy or Zomato must locate nearby restaurants and customers efficiently.</p></li></ul><p>Handling spatial data requires specialized indexing and query functions to perform geometric calculations like distance, overlap, and adjacency. </p><p>Traditional B-tree or hash indexes aren&#8217;t optimized for multi-dimensional data. Instead, spatial data structures like <strong>R-trees</strong>, <strong>Quadtrees</strong>, and <strong>Geohashes</strong> are used to narrow down search areas efficiently.</p><div

choice for storing and querying spatial data.</p><ul><li><p>Allows you to run complex geospatial queries (e.g., <code>ST_Distance</code>, <code>ST_Within</code>, <code>ST_Intersects</code>).</p></li><li><p>Provides ACID compliance for transactional needs, making it ideal for applications requiring both spatial queries and data integrity.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>MongoDB (Geospatial Indexing)</strong>: Offers geospatial indexing for radius or polygon-based searches.</p><ul><li><p>Supports <strong>2dsphere indexes</strong> for Earth-centric queries and <strong>2d indexes</strong> for flat (planar) data.</p></li><li><p>Enables fast location-based searches, such as finding points within a given distance (<code>$near</code> queries).</p></li><li><p>Great if you prefer a NoSQL approach with flexible schema.</p></li></ul></li></ul><div><hr></div><p>Hope you enjoyed reading this article.</p><p>If you

Projects like ratatui, cursive, and others do a much better job of embracing why we use Rust in the first place.</p> <p>ncurses-rs is MIT licensed, so anyone may pick up where I left off, but please consider my point regarding what we as a community want people to be using. It shouldn&#39;t include unsafe, thin wrappers for terribly unsafe C libs. :)</p> <p>&lt;also posted on Lobsters and IRC so that people can know and migrate accordingly&gt;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeaye\"> /u/Jeaye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Seconds Since the Epoch","url":"https://aphyr.com/posts/378-seconds-since-the-epoch","date":1735152381,"author":"Aphyr","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>This is not at all news, but it comes up often enough that I think there should be a concise explanation of the problem. People, myself included, like to say that POSIX time, also known as Unix time, is the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date\">number</a> <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Seconds-since-the-Epoch.html\">of</a> <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/time.2.html\">seconds</a> <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/time#Unix\">since</a> <a href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/datetime.html\">the</a> <a href=\"https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Time.html\">Unix</a> <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/timestamp_type_r.html\">epoch</a>, which was 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00.</p>\n<p>This is not true. Or rather, it isn’t true in the sense most people think. For example, it is presently 2024-12-25 at 18:54:53 UTC. The POSIX time is 1735152686. It has been 1735152715 seconds since the POSIX epoch. The POSIX time number is twenty-nine seconds lower.</p>\n<p>This is because POSIX time is derived <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub151-1.pdf\">in IEEE 1003.1</a> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\">Coordinated Universal Time</a>. The standard assumes that every day is exactly 86,400 seconds long. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <em>time()</em> function returns the value of time in <b>seconds since the Epoch</b>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>seconds since the Epoch.</b> A value to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch. A Coordinated Universal Time name (specified in terms of seconds (<em>tm_sec</em>), minutes (<em>tm_min</em>), hours (<em>tm_hour</em>), days since January 1 of the year (<em>tm_yday</em>), and calendar year minus 1900\n(<em>tm_year</em>)) is related to a time represented as <em>seconds since the Epoch</em> according to the expression below.</p>\n<p>If year &lt; 1970 or the value is negative, the relationship is undefined. If year ≥ 1970 and the value is non-negative, the value is related to a Coordinated Universal Time name according to the expression:</p>\n<p><em>tm_sec</em> + <em>tm_min</em> * 60 + <em>tm_hour</em> * 3600 + <em>tm_yday</em> * 86400 +\n(<em>tm_year</em>-70) * 31536000 + ((<em>tm_year</em> - 69) / 4) * 86400</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The length of the day is not 86,400 seconds, and in fact changes over time. To keep UTC days from drifting too far from solar days, astronomers periodically declare a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second\">leap second</a> in UTC. Consequently, every few years POSIX time jumps backwards, <a href=\"https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=134113577921904\">wreaking</a> <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/qantas-suffers-delays-due-to-linux-leap-second-bug/\">utter</a> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/\">havoc</a>. Someday it might jump forward.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#archaeology\" id=\"archaeology\">Archaeology</a></h2>\n<p>Appendix B of IEEE 1003 has a fascinating discussion of leap seconds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The concept of leap seconds is added for precision; at the time this standard was published, 14 leap seconds had been added since January 1, 1970. These 14 seconds are ignored to provide an easy and compatible method of computing time differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I, too, love to ignore things to make my life easy. The standard authors knew “seconds since the epoch” were not, in fact, seconds since the epoch. And they admit as much:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most systems’ notion of “time” is that of a continuously-increasing value, so this value should increase even during leap seconds. However, not only do most systems not keep track of leap seconds, but most systems are probably not synchronized to any standard time reference. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require that a time represented as seconds since the Epoch precisely represent the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch.</p>\n<p>It is sufficient to require that applications be allowed to treat this time as if it represented the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch. It is the responsibility of the vendor of the system, and the administrator of the system, to ensure that this value represents the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch as closely as necessary for the application being run on that system….</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I imagine there was some debate over this point. The appendix punts, saying that vendors and administrators must make time align “as closely as necessary”, and that “this value should increase even during leap seconds”. The latter is achievable, but the former is arguably impossible: the standard requires POSIX clocks be twenty-nine seconds off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consistent interpretation of seconds since the Epoch can be critical to certain types of distributed applications that rely on such timestamps to synchronize events. The accrual of leap seconds in a time standard is not predictable. The number of leap seconds since the Epoch will likely increase. The standard is\nmore concerned about the synchronization of time between applications of astronomically short duration and the Working Group expects these concerns to become more critical in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a sense, the opposite happened. Time synchronization is <em>always</em> off, so systems generally function (however incorrectly) when times drift a bit. But leap seconds are rare, and the linearity evoked by the phrase “seconds since the epoch” is so deeply baked in to our intuition, that software can accrue serious, unnoticed bugs. Until a few years later, one of those tiny little leap seconds takes down a big chunk of the internet.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#what-to-do-instead\" id=\"what-to-do-instead\">What To Do Instead</a></h2>\n<p>If you just need to compute the duration between two events on one computer, use <a href=\"https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/reference_guide/sect-posix_clocks#sect-POSIX_clocks\">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</a>. If you don’t need to exchange timestamps with other systems that assume POSIX time, use <a href=\"https://www.ipses.com/eng/in-depth-analysis/standard-of-time-definition/\">TAI, GPS, or maybe LORAN</a>. If you do need rough alignment with other POSIX-timestamp systems, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/time/smear\">smear leap seconds</a> over a longer window of time. Libraries like <a href=\"https://github.com/qntm/t-a-i\">qntm’s t-a-i</a> can convert back and forth between POSIX and TAI.</p>\n<p>There’s an ongoing effort to <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/end-of-leap-seconds-2022\">end leap seconds</a>, hopefully <a href=\"https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/64811223/Resolutions-2022.pdf/281f3160-fc56-3e63-dbf7-77b76500990f\">by 2035</a>. It’ll require additional work to build conversion tables into everything that relies on the “86,400 seconds per day” assumption, but it should also make it much simpler to ask questions like “how many seconds between these two times”. At least for times after 2035!</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Portspoof: Emulate a valid service on all 65535 TCP ports","url":"https://github.com/drk1wi/portspoof","date":1735148644,"author":"nateb2022","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/drk1wi/portspoof\">https://github.com/drk1wi/portspoof</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42509953\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42509953</a></p>\n<p>Points: 340</p>\n<p># Comments: 129</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Bret Taylor Urges Rethink of Software Development as AI Reshapes Industry","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/25/1611229/bret-taylor-urges-rethink-of-software-development-as-ai-reshapes-industry?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735143000,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Software development is entering an \"autopilot era\" with AI coding assistants, but the industry needs to prepare for full autonomy, argues former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor. Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? \n\nIf generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? \n\nIf a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? \n\nToday, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor.
