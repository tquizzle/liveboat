But to build the new capital, thousands of indigenous families were evicted from ancestral forest lands—lands in many cases given to private investors in Nusantra. And there is no court in Indonesia that will change that—because the laws that allow these evictions remain in force.  The same method has been used for decades to clear forest lands for wide-scale agriculture—such as the palm oil industry and for mining interests. The practice is the result of 150 years of colonial legacy and dictatorship, and it is still the law of the land today. Disputes over land use have dramatically expanded as the country sought to boost economic activity under President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo who left office in October of 2024. \n\nSiapa Tanggung Biaya Pembangunan? \nBom Waktu Konflik Lahan di Indonesia\n \nIbu kota Nusantara seharusnya menerangi arah pembangunan Indonesia di masa depan: berkelanjutan, progresif, dan dipenuhi peluang baru. Namun, untuk membangun ibu kota baru, ribuan masyarakat adat digusur dari tanah leluhur—yang dalam banyak kasus diserahkan kepada investor swasta. Upaya hukum acap tidak mampu menghentikan penyerobotan lahan atau penggusuran karena konstitusi yang menguatkan klaim pemerintah. Metode yang sama telah digunakan selama beberapa dekade demi membuka lahan hutan untuk pertanian berskala besar, seperti industri kelapa sawit, atau pertambangan. Praktik ini merupakan warisan dari 150 tahun kekuasaan kolonial dan kediktatoran, yang hingga kini masih menciptakan sengketa demi sengketa. Konflik penggunaan lahan telah meluas secara dramatis, ketika pemerintah di Jakarta belakangan meningkatkan aktivitas ekonomi di bawah Presiden Joko “Jokowi” Widodo yang lengser pada Oktober 2024.\n\nLaporan ini adalah episode kedua dalam seri Inside Asian Conflicts milik DW.\n\nThis is the second espisode in DW’s Insidea Asian Conflicts series. \n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n01:48 Nusantra, Indonesia’s Future? \n04:54 Growth of Land Disputes under Jokowi \n08:05 Palm Oil Plantations & Displacements \n09:40 Mining: Maximum Profit and Minimum Liability \n12:01 Dutch Colonial Legacy of Dispossesion \n15:15 Way Forward? \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#indonesia #InsideAsianConflicts","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/dp2ak_QHtJ8?version=3","enclosureMime":""}]}
