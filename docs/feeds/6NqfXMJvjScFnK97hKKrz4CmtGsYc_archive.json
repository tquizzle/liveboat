Trudeau announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until a successor is chosen. Election laws mandate a vote before October but one is expected sooner. </p><p>Trump’s <a data-testid=\"prism-linkbase\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trump-economy-mexico-canada-bfed103a11a2a71d8353350f94c78814\">trade war</a> and his <a data-testid=\"prism-linkbase\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariffs-trudeau-trade-opposition-border-5d3dbbb4a701bb1676ee588bfbf2396a\">talk of making Canada the 51st state</a> have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are cancelling trips south and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.</p><p>The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in Parliamentary elections that are expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.</p><p>After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States. </p><p>Carney navigated crises when he was the head of Canada’s central bank and when he became the first non-citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. </p><p>His appointment won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.</p><p>Carney is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever of 1%, working with bankers to sustain lending through the crisis and, critically, letting the public know rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing.</p><p>And it wasn’t just that he had good policies — he sold them to the public in a way everyone could understand. He was the first central banker to commit to keep them at a historic low for a definite time, a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow.</p><p>Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January.</p><p>The other top Liberal leadership candidate is former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.</p><p>Three points turned the leadership race into a runaway for Carney. Freeland had a long association with the unpopular Trudeau. Carney worked hard to gather support from Liberal members of Parliament members. And Trump’s tariff fixation was also pivotal, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. </p><p>“Liberal backbenchers feared losing their seats and knew that Carney was more electable as their leader than Freeland,” Wiseman said. </p><p>The Liberal Party members will pick a new leader in a secret vote by about 140,000 members that will be announced on Sunday. The new leader is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either the new Liberal party leader will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote this month. </p><p>Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Carney’s calm demeanor and outstanding resume make him a reassuring figure to many Canadians at a time when Trump is going after their country’s economy and sovereignty.</p><p>Béland said that style and profile stands in strong contrast to the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre, whom he called a true career politician who has embraced a populist rhetoric not unlike Trump's. </p><p>Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who says he will to put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster and cut taxes. </p><p>“That works with his base but that is not welcomed by other Canadians, especially considering what the U.S. president is now saying about, and doing to, their country,” Béland said. </p><p>Poilievre urged Trump on Friday stop the attacks on Canada and “the monthly melodrama that is hurting our economies on both side of the border.\"</p>","contentLength":4497,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j6skkc/canada_to_name_a_new_leader_while_dealing_with/"},{"title":"Intensified Russian attacks: How important is it for Putin to claim victory in Kursk? | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu-9tqMFPKY","date":1741469625,"author":"DW News","guid":497,"unread":true,"content":"<article>More than a dozen people have been killed in Ukraine, during heavy overnight attacks by Russia.

Fire engulfed a five-storey apartment building. As emergency services arrived, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Russia</a> launched another strike on the same area.

Asked if Putin was taking advantage of US aid pauses, Trump on Friday acknowledged Ukraine was experiencing a “tremendous pounding”.</p><p>He suggested, however, that “anyone in Putin’s position” would do the same. Before a meeting on Tuesday between US and Ukrainian representatives in Saudi Arabia, Trump said he was “finding it easier” to deal with Moscow than with Kyiv.</p><p>European leaders suggested the US president was complicit in the latest devastation.</p><p>The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said there had been “another tragic night in Ukraine”, with “more bombs, more aggression and more victims”. Without mentioning Trump directly, he said: “This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians.”</p><p>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the “relentless” Russian missiles demonstrated that Putin had no interest in peace. “We must step up our military support. Otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price,” she said.</p><p>Zelenskyy has been seeking to repair relations with Trump after their acrimonious White House meeting last month. Ukraine’s president has sketched out a peace plan – beginning with a truce on land and sea – and said he is ready to sign a favourable minerals deal with the US.</p><p>So far, however, Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine while making no demands of Russia. Zelenskyy said Saturday’s strike showed Moscow’s objectives had not changed. He called for an increase in sanctions against Russia to “collapse” its war economy.</p><p>Russia’s latest strike transformed the centre of Dobropillia into a sprawling ruin. The apartment block was a gutted mess. There were burnt-out cars and vans and smouldering debris. Rescuers swept up glass and twisted pieces of metal. Video from the strike showed a terrifying explosion.</p><p>Irina Kostenko, 59, spent the night cowering in her hallway with her husband. When she left the apartment building on Saturday, she saw a neighbour “lying dead on the ground, covered with a blanket”. “It was shocking, I don’t have the words to describe it,” she told the AFP news agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia has exploited the US intelligence and weapons freeze to launch a series of bold attacks. North Korean and Russian troops have broken through Ukraine’s defences in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian units have for seven months occupied a parcel of territory.</p><p>There were unconfirmed reports on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had managed to stabilise the situation and avoid encirclement, at least for now. A hundred Russian soldiers crept through a gas pipeline in a raid on the Kyiv-held Russian town of Sudzha, <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2025/03/8/7501875/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Ukrainskaya Pravda newspaper reported</a>.</p><p>Ukraine’s hold on territory in Kursk is increasingly precarious. Soldiers told the Observer two supply roads with the Ukrainian city of Sumy were open, but came under constant attack from Russian drones and artillery.</p><p>Serhiy Sternenko, a prominent Ukrainian activist, described the logistics situation there as “rapidly deteriorating and already critical”. “Logistics routes to Sudzha are under full enemy fire control,” he posted on X.</p><p>According to Kremlin bloggers, Russian combat groups advanced several kilometres across the border into Ukraine’s Sumy region.

A score of 100 percent would mean full equality with men. African women are a long way from that.\n \nIn 2023, African women scored just over 50 percent — so only halfway to complete gender equality across economic, social, and public leadership areas. It is a sobering statistic that shows only a slight improvement from 48.6 percent in 2019.\n \nBut there is some light in the darkness: Namibia, the highest-ranking country in the continent, scores 88 percent. The report calls it 'the African champion of gender equality'. Tiny Lesotho, a gender equality giant, scores 82 percent. Its constitution guarantees equal pay for women and men. And Rwanda scores almost 80 percent — The report says it has a 'strong political will for gender equality'. That might have something to do with the fact that 61 percent of Rwanda's elected representatives are women.\n \nBut elsewhere, the landscape is less promising. In regard to the extent to which men and women participate equally in decision-making in politics, government and business, things have improved slightly but that rate is so slow, it would take until 2063 for African women to achieve full equality.\n\nFrom: DW News Africa with Michael Okwu, 6 March 2025\n\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>","contentLength":1782,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/XLy_QmrKJgU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How Digital Airport Towers Could Replace Traditional ATC Towers","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pXIyrJv0Bg","date":1741446003,"author":"The Wall Street Journal","guid":532,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Despite huge leaps forward in aviation technology and safety, air-traffic controllers still depend on radar and sight.
