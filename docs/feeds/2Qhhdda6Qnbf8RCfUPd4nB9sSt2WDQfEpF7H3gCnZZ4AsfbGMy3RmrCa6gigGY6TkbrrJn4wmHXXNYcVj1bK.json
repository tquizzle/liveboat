I&#39;m just dropping a heads up that I have archived <a href=\"https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs\">https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs</a> and will not be developing it further.</p> <p>I first made ncurses-rs nearly 11 years ago and both Rust and its library ecosystem were incredibly different back then. Over the past decade, my attention has shifted to focus on other projects and ncurses-rs has received some love from the community to help it along. For that, I&#39;m grateful.</p> <p>These days, with Rust&#39;s rich and thriving library ecosystem, having such a thin wrapper around ncurses as a common TUI choice does more a disservice than anything. Projects like ratatui, cursive, and others do a much better job of embracing why we use Rust in the first place.</p> <p>ncurses-rs is MIT licensed, so anyone may pick up where I left off, but please consider my point regarding what we as a community want people to be using. It shouldn&#39;t include unsafe, thin wrappers for terribly unsafe C libs. :)</p> <p>&lt;also posted on Lobsters and IRC so that people can know and migrate accordingly&gt;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeaye\"> /u/Jeaye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"I used rapier to add physics to my game engine where im making my flight game, added better physics for more simulation like movement, better ui system, and a subtitle system (not based on a valve one).","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm7eeu/i_used_rapier_to_add_physics_to_my_game_engine/","date":1735155553,"author":"/u/KhalzButHorny","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KhalzButHorny\"> /u/KhalzButHorny </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZphLdfQ9fk&amp;ab_channel=KhalzzDev\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm7eeu/i_used_rapier_to_add_physics_to_my_game_engine/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
