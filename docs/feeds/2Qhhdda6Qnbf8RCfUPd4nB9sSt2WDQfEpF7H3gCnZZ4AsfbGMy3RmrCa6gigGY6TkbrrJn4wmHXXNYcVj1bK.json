There would be two threads, One that updates the data and the other that views the data. The data would be updated every 0.5 sec and that would be the refresh rate of the all as well. There are multiple fields for each key in the dashmap and I would like something like a table to show the name, fields1, field2,etc. I was able to do this with TKinter and ChatGPT wrote the entire code. Is there anything similar and as easy as TKinter in rust?</p> <p>Edit: Thanks for all your valuable inputs. I went with Egui extras and Claude Sonnet 3.5 helped me write the whole application. I do not know how it works, But it works as expected.

I&#39;m just dropping a heads up that I have archived <a href=\"https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs\">https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs</a> and will not be developing it further.</p> <p>I first made ncurses-rs nearly 11 years ago and both Rust and its library ecosystem were incredibly different back then. Over the past decade, my attention has shifted to focus on other projects and ncurses-rs has received some love from the community to help it along. For that, I&#39;m grateful.</p> <p>These days, with Rust&#39;s rich and thriving library ecosystem, having such a thin wrapper around ncurses as a common TUI choice does more a disservice than anything. Projects like ratatui, cursive, and others do a much better job of embracing why we use Rust in the first place.</p> <p>ncurses-rs is MIT licensed, so anyone may pick up where I left off, but please consider my point regarding what we as a community want people to be using. It shouldn&#39;t include unsafe, thin wrappers for terribly unsafe C libs. :)</p> <p>&lt;also posted on Lobsters and IRC so that people can know and migrate accordingly&gt;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeaye\"> /u/Jeaye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
