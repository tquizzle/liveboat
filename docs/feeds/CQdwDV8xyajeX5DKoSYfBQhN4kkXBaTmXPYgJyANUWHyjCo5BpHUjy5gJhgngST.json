Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Linux+Kernel+6.12+Confirmed+As+LTS%2C+Will+Be+Supported+For+'Multiple+Years'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0125219%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0125219%2Flinux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0125219/linux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Linux 4.19, the Last Supported Kernel of the Linux 4.x Series, Finally Reaches EOL","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/2047211/linux-419-the-last-supported-kernel-of-the-linux-4x-series-finally-reaches-eol?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733604600,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Slashdot reader prisoninmate shared this report from 9to5Linux:\nLinux kernel 4.19, the last of the Linux 4.x kernel series, has now reached the end of its supported life as announced earlier on the Linux kernel mailing list by kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman. The Linux 4.19 kernel branch was released more than six years ago, on October 22nd, 2018, and it received no less than 325 maintenance updates, the last one being Linux 4.19.325. The biggest highlights of Linux kernel 4.19 were initial Wi-Fi 6 support, the EROFS file system, and a union mount filesystem implementation. Kroah-Hartman said on the mailing list. \"This one is finished, it is end-of-life as of right now... It had a good life...\"\n\n\nAs a \"fun\" proof that this one is finished (and that any company saying they care about it really should have their statements validated with facts), I looked at the \"unfixed\" CVEs from this kernel release. Currently it is a list 983 CVEs long, too long to list here.... Note, this does NOT count the hardware CVEs which kernel.org does not track, and many are sill unfixed in this kernel branch. \n\nYes, CVE counts don't mean much these days, but hey, it's a signal of something, right? I take it to mean that no one is caring enough to backport the needed fixes to this branch, which means that you shouldn't be using it anymore. \n\nAnyway, please move off to a more modern kernel if you were using this one for some reason.

By infecting the firmware that runs immediately before the operating system loads, these UEFI bootkits continue to run even when the hard drive is replaced or reformatted. Now the same type of chip-dwelling malware has been found in the wild for backdooring Linux machines. Researchers at security firm ESET said Wednesday that Bootkitty -- the name unknown threat actors gave to their Linux bootkit -- was uploaded to VirusTotal earlier this month. Compared to its Windows cousins, Bootkitty is still relatively rudimentary, containing imperfections in key under-the-hood functionality and lacking the means to infect all Linux distributions other than Ubuntu. That has led the company researchers to suspect the new bootkit is likely a proof-of-concept release. To date, ESET has found no evidence of actual infections in the wild.\n \nStill, Bootkitty suggests threat actors may be actively developing a Linux version of the same sort of unkillable bootkit that previously was found only targeting Windows machines. \"Whether a proof of concept or not, Bootkitty marks an interesting move forward in the UEFI threat landscape, breaking the belief about modern UEFI bootkits being Windows-exclusive threats,\" ESET researchers wrote. \"Even though the current version from VirusTotal does not, at the moment, represent a real threat to the majority of Linux systems, it emphasizes the necessity of being prepared for potential future threats.\" [...] As ESET notes, the discovery is nonetheless significant because it demonstrates someone -- most likely a malicious threat actor -- is pouring resources and considerable know-how into creating working UEFI bootkits for Linux. Currently, there are few simple ways for people to check the integrity of the UEFI running on either Windows or Linux devices. The demand for these sorts of defenses will likely grow in the coming years.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+World's+First+Unkillable+UEFI+Bootkit+For+Linux%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F27%2F2028231%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F27%2F2028231%2Fthe-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/24/11/27/2028231/the-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
