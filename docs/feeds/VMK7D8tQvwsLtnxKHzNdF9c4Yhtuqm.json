Sharing a recent side project of mine, the Atlas of Space, that I built out to explore the Solar System.<p>As a long-time space nerd, I realized recently that I didn't have a good intuition on the scale, speed, and relative orientation of the celestial bodies around us. So over the break I built out a kind of spatial Wikipedia to click around and learn about planets, moons, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun.<p>The physics is all simulated in the browser using simple Newtonian mechanics. There's a lot left to do from here, including modeling objects in non-Keplerian orbits and replaying different spacecraft missions.<p>Hope you have fun clicking around, and curious to hear what I should improve next!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634787\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634787</a></p>\n<p>Points: 751</p>\n<p># Comments: 123</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Fidget","url":"https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/fidget/","date":1736346658,"author":"todsacerdoti","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/fidget/\">https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/fidget/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634624\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634624</a></p>\n<p>Points: 550</p>\n<p># Comments: 55</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Cracking a 512-bit DKIM key for less than $8 in the cloud","url":"https://dmarcchecker.app/articles/crack-512-bit-dkim-rsa-key","date":1736339554,"author":"awulf","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://dmarcchecker.app/articles/crack-512-bit-dkim-rsa-key\">https://dmarcchecker.app/articles/crack-512-bit-dkim-rsa-key</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633501\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633501</a></p>\n<p>Points: 794</p>\n<p># Comments: 405</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Operating System in 1,000 Lines â€“ Intro","url":"https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en","date":1736320730,"author":"ingve","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en\">https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631873\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42631873</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1029</p>\n<p># Comments: 121</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Magic/tragic email links: don't make them the only option","url":"https://recyclebin.zip/posts/annoyinglinks/","date":1736283984,"author":"gepeto42","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://recyclebin.zip/posts/annoyinglinks/\">https://recyclebin.zip/posts/annoyinglinks/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42627453\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42627453</a></p>\n<p>Points: 702</p>\n<p># Comments: 502</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases","url":"https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases/","date":1736282675,"author":"BerislavLopac","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases/\">https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42627227\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42627227</a></p>\n<p>Points: 798</p>\n<p># Comments: 363</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease attributable to sugar beverages","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4","date":1736272278,"author":"tchalla","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42625193\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42625193</a></p>\n<p>Points: 420</p>\n<p># Comments: 380</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: Tramway SDK â€“ An unholy union between Half-Life and Morrowind engines","url":"https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/why.html","date":1736266929,"author":"racenis","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Hello everyone, I would like to see if there is any interest in this little project that I have been working on for the past few years.<p>Could be relevant, seeing the direction in which the mainstream game engines are going.<p>I didn't really like any of the already existing options, so I tried to make my own and it turned out to be easier than expected.<p>It's sort of like a low-budget Unreal/Source, but with open-world streaming support and it is free and open source.
