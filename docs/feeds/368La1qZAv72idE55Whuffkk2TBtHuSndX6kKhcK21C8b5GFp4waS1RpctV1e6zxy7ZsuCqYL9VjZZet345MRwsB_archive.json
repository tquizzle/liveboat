My current work-in-progress (WIP) involves setting up a Beelink Proxmox and K3s cluster.</p> <p>Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the setup from top to bottom and left to right in the first two pictures:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Mac Mini:</strong> Running Docker and will soon be replaced by the cluster.</li> <li><strong>Fiber ONT and Home Run HD:</strong> The Home Run HD is behind the ONT and is used for Plex streaming.</li> <li><strong>Beelink S12 Pro:</strong> Running HAOS and essential software like Nginx Proxy Manager.</li> <li><strong>UDM SE:</strong> It used to run Protect, but I had to upgrade because I acquired 13 cameras. It now serves as a router firewall, including port forwarding to NPM and running DynDNS.</li> <li><strong>UNVR running Protect:</strong></li> <li><strong>Unifi Switch Pro Max 24 POE:</strong> This is the central switch for the network. I plan to move my VLAN routing to this switch and only use the main network on the router.</li> <li><strong>Unifi Patch Panel:</strong></li> <li><strong>Unifi Brush Panel:</strong></li> <li><strong>Unifi PDU Pro:</strong> Iâ€™ve been eagerly waiting for this PDU for about six months. You can see how I rearranged the rack in the third photo before getting it. I had reserved space for it, but then I added the mini cluster.</li> <li><strong>Beelink Sei12 Max x3:</strong> These boxes contain 500 GB and 1 TB NVMe drives with 64 GB of RAM and 2.5 GbE ports.</li> <li><strong>PiKVM V4 mini:</strong> This is connected to the four Beelink boxes via an ezcoo KVM. </li> <li><strong>Synology Disk Station 1821+</strong> I have five 20 TB and three 4 TB drives in the Synology version of RAID 6. I intend to upgrade the 4 TB drives as space becomes necessary. I recently replaced the first five drives, increasing the available storage from 22 TB to 65 TB! This device is performing exceptionally well. It also runs Plex and some backups, including an incremental backup of a shared family Google Drive containing numerous tape and film videos from my mother-in-lawâ€™s childhood.</li> <li>The bottom section primarily serves as smart home hubs. <ul> <li>It has an Echo Dot (muted and speaker disabled) for Amazon-only integrations (I can communicate with it using text-to-speech and control a few devices).</li> <li>A Rachio sprinkler timer hub.</li> <li>A Hue Bridge.</li> <li>A Lutron Bridge for light switches.</li> <li>A Lutron Bridge for window shades. We were running out of compatible devices (the maximum number of supported devices is 75), so splitting this setup was highly beneficial.</li> <li>A Unifi AI Port. I am hoping to install facial recognition capabilities on my G4 Pro Doorbell to enable personalized greetings. </li> </ul></li> <li>Last is the UPS, it has since been kicked out of the rack and is next to it on the right. Itâ€™s great and lets me do minor electrical work without turning off the WiFi. I get about 18 minutes when everything is running full bore. The Synology acts and the host for the UPS shut down notifications. </li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alexbbt\"> /u/alexbbt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i09pes\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1i09pes/it_is_never_done_but_it_has_come_a_long_way/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Build home made router.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1i04lo9/build_home_made_router/","date":1736737888,"author":"/u/Touky1444","unread":true,"content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1i04lo9/build_home_made_router/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gx3cta2tVgY3qIPNBuFt_M-qx-D8VgRzaCxhCGfaong.jpg\" alt=\"Build home made router.\" title=\"Build home made router.\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is work in progress the build is not over.
