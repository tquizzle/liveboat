The day has come, and I have no idea what I&#39;m doing.</p> <p>I&#39;ve found surprisingly few resources on getting started with rack mounting stuff. I assume this means that it&#39;s pretty straightforward, but I got these servers second hand on-the-cheap, and have no mounting hardware other than the rack ears. I&#39;d like slides on the 4U unit especially, as it&#39;d be nice to work on it without removing it from the rack. It sounds like slides are usually proprietary, but how do I find them for old used commercial hardware? Am I better off giving up on that dream and just using the shelves it came with? They sure seem like not the best solution.</p> <p>The one thing I do understand is how the rack ears work, I intend to use rack studs. Anything beyond that, I&#39;m pretty lost.</p> <p>Tl;dr: I&#39;m looking for tips, hacks, suggestions, and resources for how to rack mount these things and future things, considering I&#39;ve never touched a rack before in my life.</p> <p>Your help is much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/joelk111\"> /u/joelk111 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hoqc4a\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hoqc4a/those_servers_that_rack_how/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"1 Year later...slightly nicer but still in progress","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hongzs/1_year_laterslightly_nicer_but_still_in_progress/","date":1735444436,"author":"/u/turbocharged5652","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hongzs/1_year_laterslightly_nicer_but_still_in_progress/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/djAYrM73TMjTfwh8myVpsJzQccUWXew7oXvjRpyl78A.jpg\" alt=\"1 Year later...slightly nicer but still in progress\" title=\"1 Year later...slightly nicer but still in progress\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is my 1 year &quot;evolution&quot; if you will.
