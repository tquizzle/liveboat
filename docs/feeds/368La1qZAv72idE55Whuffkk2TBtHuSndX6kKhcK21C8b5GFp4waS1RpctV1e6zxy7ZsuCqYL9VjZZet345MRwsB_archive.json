Everything was down though; TrueNAS Scale, all VMs… yay.</p> <p>After troubleshooting (checking / reseating all other components), the conclusion is that the motherboard that is only one year and a few month old, has crapped out. I can’t even access the BIOS. The POST code stays at 00 and the power management options in the IPMI interface + the power button do nothing…</p> <p>At this time, I started Googling... I use an AsRock Rack B650D4U motherboard and apparently there’s a bad batch of these that die exactly with these symptoms. Great!

That experience was a wake-up call for them, realizing they weren’t doing enough for off-site backups, even though they had everything stored across multiple <a href=\"http://drives.So\">drives.So</a> I’m looking for proper backup recommendations. How do you handle off-site backups? How do you protect against hardware failure or other disasters?

IPMI still worked but simply said that the host was down. No error logs, nothing! Went to the server and found its fans spinning normally, power button LED lit and NICs also apparently up. Everything was down though; TrueNAS Scale, all VMs… yay.</p> <p>After troubleshooting (checking / reseating all other components), the conclusion is that the motherboard that is only one year and a few month old, has crapped out. I can’t even access the BIOS. The POST code stays at 00 and the power management options in the IPMI interface + the power button do nothing…</p> <p>At this time, I started Googling... I use an AsRock Rack B650D4U motherboard and apparently there’s a bad batch of these that die exactly with these symptoms. Great! Luckily it’s still under warrantly, so I hope there will be a quick swap to a newer hardware revision that doesn’t suffer this issue.</p> <p>Anyway, happy Christmas everybody!</p> <p>Some more reading material:</p> <p><a href=\"https://forum.level1techs.com/t/asrock-b650d4u-code-00-server-motherboard-failure/216110/21\">https://forum.level1techs.com/t/asrock-b650d4u-code-00-server-motherboard-failure/216110/21</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/asrock-rack-b650d4u-microatx-for-ryzen-7000-processors.38217/page-7\">https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/asrock-rack-b650d4u-microatx-for-ryzen-7000-processors.38217/page-7</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1gmm8vp/asrock_rack_b650d4u_died_again\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1gmm8vp/asrock_rack_b650d4u_died_again</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/unidentified_sp\"> /u/unidentified_sp </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmr5zc/server_down_on_christmas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmr5zc/server_down_on_christmas/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Built a Powerful and Silent AMD EPYC Home Server with My Kids (for a Fraction of the Price!)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/","date":1735217190,"author":"/u/aospan","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1hmnnwg/built_a_powerful_and_silent_amd_epyc_home_server/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oweY9kO6jsFXGPyuO9o3LCMRv-l2v0ZPEO1_8Poh6yM.jpg\" alt=\"Built a Powerful and Silent AMD EPYC Home Server with My Kids (for a Fraction of the Price!)\" title=\"Built a Powerful and Silent AMD EPYC Home Server with My Kids (for a Fraction of the Price!)\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>I wanted to share a fun weekend project I worked on with my kids – we built a beast of a home server powered by an AMD EPYC 7C13 (3rd gen). This CPU is typically found in big cloud provider datacenters, and while its MSRP is around $7000, we snagged one on eBay for just <strong>$875</strong>! 😲</p> <h1>Quick Benchmark Highlights:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>M.2 SSD</strong>: Achieves an insane <strong>7GB/sec throughput</strong>.</li> <li><strong>DDR4 RAM</strong>: Delivers <strong>130GB/sec bandwidth</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Linux Kernel Build (My lovely Real-World Benchmark)</strong>: Fully compiled with all options enabled in <strong>just 10 minutes</strong>.
