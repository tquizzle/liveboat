It has support for resampling techniques which historically have always been used for imbalanced classification use-cases. However, now that we are a few years down the line, it may be time to start rethinking the library. As it turns out, other techniques may be preferable. We talk to the maintainer, Guillaume Lemaitre, to discuss the lessons that have been learned over the last decade.\n\nThe imbalanced learn docs can be found here:\nhttps://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/\n\nScikit-learn has a great guide on calibrating a classifier, which can be found here:\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cost_sensitive_learning.html#addressing-the-problem-with-a-business-metric\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:14 How imbalanced-learn started\n15:32 Resampling API\n21:32 Scikit-learn\n25:41 Lessons learned\n34:50 Fix in sklearn\n43:28 More reflections\n51:17 Wrapup\n\nWe have a Discord these days, feel free to discuss the podcast with us there! https://discord.probabl.ai\n\nThis podcast is part of the open efforts over at probabl.
