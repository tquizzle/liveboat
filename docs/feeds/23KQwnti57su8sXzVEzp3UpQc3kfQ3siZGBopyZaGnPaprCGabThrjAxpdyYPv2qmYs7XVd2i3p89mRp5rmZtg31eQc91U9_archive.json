Here’s a summary of the situation and what I’ve tried so far:</p> <h1>The Problem:</h1> <ul> <li>The touchscreen used to work but recently stopped functioning after some updates.</li> <li>The display works perfectly, but touch input is not recognized by the system.</li> </ul> <h1>System Details:</h1> <ul> <li>Raspberry Pi Model: Raspberry Pi 4</li> <li>OS: Raspberry Pi OS (latest version)</li> <li>Kernel: 6.6.62+rpt-rpi-v8</li> <li>Touchscreen: Official Raspberry Pi 7-inch touchscreen</li> </ul> <h1>What I’ve Tried:</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Checked Modules and Logs</strong>: <ul> <li>The raspberrypi_ts module is loaded, and dmesg shows that the input device is registered as &quot;raspberrypi-ts.&quot; However, no input device (e.g., eventX or touchscreen) is listed in /dev/input/.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Tried Alternative Drivers</strong>: <ul> <li>Tested both raspberrypi_ts and rpi-ft5406 overlays in /boot/config.txt. Neither overlay made the touch functionality work.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Tested GUI and Graphics Driver</strong>: <ul> <li>Full KMS (vc4-kms-v3d) prevents touch from working.</li> <li>Fake KMS (vc4-fkms-v3d) was also tested but didn’t solve the issue.</li> <li>Removing GPU overlays disables the GUI altogether.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Checked for Input Events</strong>: <ul> <li>Tried evtest and libinput, but no touch events are registered.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Updated Everything</strong>: <ul> <li>Ran all updates and upgrades, including rpi-update, but no change.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Hardware Verification</strong>: <ul> <li>Checked ribbon cables and connections; all seem secure and undamaged.</li> <li>The display works fine, so power and DSI connections appear functional.</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>Anyone has a good idea on what to try next?
