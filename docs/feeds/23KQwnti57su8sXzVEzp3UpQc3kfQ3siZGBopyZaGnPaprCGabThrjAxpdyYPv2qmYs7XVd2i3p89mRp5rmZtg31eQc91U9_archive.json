LED on controller stops flashing and holds solid.</li><li>Controller functions perfectly.</li></ul><p>For my Pi, however, I get through the first 3, but even though the Pi says that pairing is successful, the controller continues to flash as though it has not been paired. On Batocera, this is particularly egregious because it will fill the screen with connected/disconnected messages, constantly going back and forth. And since the controller hasn't exited pairing mode, it shuts down a short time later.</p><p>I've tried this on both Batocera and Pi OS with the same results.
