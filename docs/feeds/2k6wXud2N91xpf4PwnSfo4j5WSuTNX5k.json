If you want to impact the way a billion people experience music you have to build something for a billion people,\" Shulman said on the 20VC podcast. \"And so that is first and foremost giving everybody the joys of creating music and this is a huge departure from how it is now. It's not really enjoyable to make music now [...] It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people don't enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.\"\n \nSuno AI works like other popular generative AI tools, allowing users to generate music by writing text prompts describing the kind of music they want to hear. Also like many other generative AI tools, Suno was trained on heaps of copyrighted music it fed into its training dataset without consent, a practice Suno is currently being sued for by the recording industry. In the interview, Shulman says he's disappointed that the recording industry is suing his company because he believes Suno and other similar AI music generators will ultimately allow more people to make and enjoy music, which will only grow the audience and industry, benefiting everyone. That may end up being true, and could be compared to the history of electronic music, digital production tools, or any other technology that allowed more people to make more music.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=CEO+of+AI+Music+Company+Says+People+Don't+Like+Making+Music%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F217244%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F217244%2Fceo-of-ai-music-company-says-people-dont-like-making-music%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/217244/ceo-of-ai-music-company-says-people-dont-like-making-music?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23578327&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"New York Starts Enforcing $15 Broadband Law That ISPs Tried To Kill","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/213221/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1736805600,"author":"BeauHD","unread":true,"content":"Ars Technica's Jon Brodkin reports: The New York law requiring Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes will take effect on Wednesday this week following a multi-year court battle in which the state defeated broadband industry lobby groups. A US appeals court upheld the law in April 2024, reversing the ruling of a district judge who blocked it in 2021. The Supreme Court last month decided not to hear the broadband industry's challenge, leaving the appeals court ruling in place. The state law requires Internet providers to offer $15- or $20-per-month service to people with low incomes.\n \nAs we've written, the battle between New York and ISPs was an important test case for how states can regulate broadband providers when the Federal Communications Commission isn't doing so. The Biden-era FCC's attempt to reinstate net neutrality rules and regulate broadband providers as common carriers was blocked in court, but ISPs lost the fight against the New York affordability law and an earlier fight against California's net neutrality law.\n \nNew York-based ISPs can comply by offering $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds. The price must include \"any recurring taxes and fees such as recurring rental fees for service provider equipment required to obtain broadband service and usage fees.\" Price increases are to be capped at 2 percent per year, and state officials will periodically review whether minimum required speeds should be raised. New York Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian last week issued an order stating that the law will take effect on January 15. \"On December 16, 2024, the United States Supreme Court denied the Plaintiff's request for further review,\" the order said. \"As part of the litigation, the [New York attorney general] agreed not to enforce the ABA [Affordable Broadband Act] until 30 days after the date when the US Supreme Court decided the writ of Certiorari. Thus, the ABA will once again take effect and may be enforced in New York on January 15, 2025.\" The order said it plans to implement the law quickly because of \"developments at the federal level impacting the affordability of broadband service.\"\n \nISPs can receive one-month exemptions by filing paperwork by Wednesday confirming they meet the subscriber threshold, notes Ars. To secure longer-term exemptions, ISPs must submit detailed financial information by February 15.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=New+York+Starts+Enforcing+%2415+Broadband+Law+That+ISPs+Tried+To+Kill%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F213221%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F213221%2Fnew-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/213221/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23578323&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Euro-Cloud Anexia Moves 12,000 VMs Off VMware to Homebrew KVM Platform","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/2050210/euro-cloud-anexia-moves-12000-vms-off-vmware-to-homebrew-kvm-platform?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1736803200,"author":"BeauHD","unread":true,"content":"The Register's Simon Sharwood reports: Broadcom has lost another sizable customer for its VMware platform: Austrian cloud provider Anexia has moved 12,000 VMs, some of them rented by major European businesses, to an open-source system based on the KVM hypervisor. Anexia was founded in 2006, is based in Austria, and provides cloud services from over 100 locations around the world by placing equipment in third party datacenters. Clients include remote access and control vendor TeamViewer, and airline Lufthansa -- plus plenty more outfits that need reliable hosting and service to match.\n \nCEO Alexander Windbichler told The Register that after Broadcom acquired VMware, increased licensing costs, and made big changes to its partner program, Anexia remained eligible to operate a VMware-powered cloud. But Windbichler felt he couldn't afford to continue, because Broadcom offered new terms that saw the cost of VMware licenses rise sharply. The CEO preferred not to enumerate the increase precisely however The Register understands it exceeded 500 percent. Whatever the actual figure, Windbichler said the cost increase \"Would have been existential for us.\"\n \n\"We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,\" he said. \"With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.\" That arrangement, the CEO said, would have created extreme stress on company cashflow. \"We would not be able to compete with the market,\" he said. \"We had customers on contracts, and they would not pay for a price increase.\" Windbichler considered legal action, but felt the fight would have been slow and expensive. Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Euro-Cloud+Anexia+Moves+12%2C000+VMs+Off+VMware+to+Homebrew+KVM+Platform%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F2050210%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F2050210%2Feuro-cloud-anexia-moves-12000-vms-off-vmware-to-homebrew-kvm-platform%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/2050210/euro-cloud-anexia-moves-12000-vms-off-vmware-to-homebrew-kvm-platform?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23578301&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The CIA’s first CTO, Nand Mulchandani, prepares for the Trump administration","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/the-cias-first-cto-nand-mulchandani-prepares-for-the-trump-administration/","date":1736801597,"author":"Connie Loizos","unread":true,"content":"<p>In April 2022, the CIA decided to swipe right on Nand Mulchandani, appointing him as its first-ever Chief Technology Officer.

This means one person won't have control over the entire project. The organization is trying to differentiate itself from social networks controlled by CEOs like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. While exact details are yet to be finalized, this means that Mastodon's current CEO and creator, Eugen Rochko, will hand over management bits of the organization to the new entity and focus on the product strategy.\n \nThe organization said that it will continue to host the mastodon.social and mastodon.online servers, which users can sign up for and join the ActivityPub-based network. Mastodon currently has 835,000 monthly active users spread across thousands of servers. [...] Last year, the company formed a U.S.-based nonprofit to get more funds and grants with Twitter co-founder Biz Stone on the board. At the same time, the organization lost its nonprofit status in Germany. [...] The blog post noted that the new Europe-based nonprofit entity will wholly own the Mastodon GmbH for-profit entity. The organization is in the process of finalizing the place where the new entity will be set up. \"We are taking the time to select the appropriate jurisdiction and structure in Europe. Then we will determine which other (subsidiary) legal structures are needed to support operations and sustainability,&#226; Mastodon said in a blog post. \"Throughout, we will focus on establishing the appropriate governance and leadership frameworks that reflect the nature and purpose of Mastodon as a whole, and responsibly serve the community.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Mastodon+Announces+Transition+To+Nonprofit+Structure%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F2038215%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F2038215%2Fmastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/2038215/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23578299&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Intel Battlemage Showing Off Nice OpenCL Gains With Newest Open-Source Compute Stack","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-b580-opencl-january","date":1736797920,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"content":"Last month with the launch of Intel Battlemage with the Arc B580 graphics card, there was fairly nice open-source GPU compute performance but with some outliers...

This shift comes as long-term unemployment in the U.S. has risen more than 50% since late 2022, though tech sector unemployment dropped to 2% in December.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Companies+Deploy+AI+To+Curb+Hiring+as+'Cost+Avoidance'+Gains+Ground%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F1633224%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F1633224%2Fcompanies-deploy-ai-to-curb-hiring-as-cost-avoidance-gains-ground%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/1633224/companies-deploy-ai-to-curb-hiring-as-cost-avoidance-gains-ground?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23578067&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Welcome to HackerNoon Decoded: The Best of 2024","url":"https://hackernoon.com/welcome-to-hackernoon-decoded-the-best-of-2024?source=rss","date":1736786835,"author":"HackerNoon Decoded","unread":true,"content":"<h2 id=\"welcometohackernoondecodedhttpshackernooncomphackernoondecodedtheultimaterecapofthestorieswritersandtrendsthatdefined2024\">Welcome to <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/p/hackernoon-decoded\">HackerNoon Decoded</a>—the ultimate recap of the stories, writers, and trends that defined 2024!</h2>\n<p>Discover the stories that dominated HackerNoon, meet the top writers who captivated our readers, explore the most popular tags, and celebrate the standout readers who shaped our community.

From finance to supply chain management, these technologies are driving innovation and reshaping how businesses and individuals interact. The adaptability of DLT has also caught the attention of governments worldwide, inspiring them to create platforms tailored to their unique needs and visions for the future.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Across the globe, numerous cities and their governments have developed their own crypto projects and platforms.</strong> Each location brings its own approach, shaped by local expertise, culture, and economic priorities. These initiatives demonstrate how diverse applications of this technology can address region-specific challenges while contributing to the broader development of decentralized solutions.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe’ll explore some of these projects ahead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bondsinquincy\">Bonds in Quincy</h2>\n<p>In April 2024, the City of Quincy, Massachusetts, became the first U.S. municipality to issue bonds using DLT. A bond, in this context, is like a loan from investors to the city. The city borrows money to fund public projects, and in return, it promises to pay the investors back over time with interest. Collaborating with the bank JP Morgan and leveraging its private chain Onyx Digital Assets, Quincy raised $10 million through a seven-year bond issuance.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.211Z-gv097jetkp2d4udbidw48hvz\" alt=\"Quincy Market in Boston, Massachusetts\" title=\"right-50\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Quincy <strong><a href=\"https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/massachusetts-municipality-issues-bond-via-blockchain-in-us-public-sector-first/\">used this technology</a></strong> to simplify and modernize the bond process, making it more transparent and efficient.</strong> This innovation is part of the city's effort to “democratize” its finances, making them more transparent and efficient. Besides, now it’s easier for everyday residents to participate in funding and benefiting from local projects.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe issuance was smaller than Quincy’s typical bond sizes, but it served as a proof of concept to explore DLT's potential in simplifying processes like interest payments. This platform, for instance, can allow automatic payments to bondholders and lower costs for all parties involved.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"supplychainindubai\">Supply Chain in Dubai</h2>\n<p>The government agency responsible for regulating trade, enforcing customs laws, and facilitating the movement of goods in and out of Dubai, Dubai Customs, released a new DLT platform in July 2024. This one will work to improve how goods are tracked and traded within the city and across its borders.</p>\n<p>\\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.214Z-qs79i5zbrbs07i987cjs0ayl\" alt=\"Downtown Dubai, UAE\" title=\"right-50\" /><strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-customs-launches-blockchain-platform-amid-smart-city-effort\">Launched</a></strong> as a part of Dubai’s broader \"smart city\" initiative, this platform focuses on making supply chains more transparent and reducing delays in customs clearance by simplifying processes.** It also eliminates the need for excessive paperwork by enabling tamper-proof data sharing, which is more secure and reliable.</p>\n<p>\\\nDLT was chosen for this project because of its ability to securely store and share data across multiple locations. This technology is ideal for tracking the movement of goods in real-time, reducing fraud, and ensuring that transactions are trustworthy. By automating many procedures, the platform saves time and effort for everyone involved, from businesses managing shipments to customs officials clearing goods. This makes Dubai’s trade and logistics environment smoother and more appealing to global partners.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"identityinbuenosaires\">Identity in Buenos Aires</h2>\n<p>In October 2024, Buenos Aires (the capital of Argentina) finally released QuarkID, a digital identity platform powered by DLT, designed to enhance security and privacy for its 3.6 million citizens. <strong>QuarkID, which has been <strong><a href=\"https://thepaypers.com/digital-identity-security-online-fraud/argentina-adopts-quarkid-for-blockchain-based-citizen-id--1266717\">in development</a></strong> the whole year, allows residents to manage personal documents such as birth certificates, tax files, and vaccination records through the city’s app MiBa.</strong> This new system ensures authenticity without relying on external oversight, marking a major step forward in digital identity innovation.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.215Z-d7jsj80t4evijuaw3viokrk3\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nQuarkID uses DLT to provide secure, tamper-proof data management. The platform uses zero-knowledge cryptography, which enables individuals to share only the specific information needed for each interaction, keeping the rest of their data private. With no intermediaries involved, <strong><a href=\"https://quarkid.org/\">QuarkID</a></strong> facilitates seamless, peer-to-peer document sharing while reducing risks like identity theft and fraud.</p>\n<p>\\\nBuenos Aires plans to expand QuarkID to include more services, such as driver’s licenses and permits, and is testing its use in other 12 cities in five countries. By adopting this technology for digital identities, Argentina aims to create a more efficient, secure, and cost-effective system, setting an example for other governments to follow.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"cryptoindexinhongkong\">Crypto Index in Hong Kong</h2>\n<p>The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) made history by launching Asia’s first EU-regulated crypto index, a major development for the region. Unveiled in November 2024, the index integrates leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether into traditional financial markets. Let's remember that an index is a tool that tracks the value of a group of assets, showing how the prices of those assets change over time. The EU regulation ensures the index is accurate, trustworthy, and follows strict rules. This helps protect investors by making sure the information is reliable and transparent.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:04.215Z-gv4qd28c3sj0t2n8bcoj5pcp\" alt=\"HKEX Bitcoin Index in Nov 24\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nBy offering this initiative, <strong><a href=\"https://coinpaprika.com/news/hong-kong-launches-asia-s-first-eu-regulated-crypto-index/\">Hong Kong aims</a></strong> to meet the growing demand for crypto investment opportunities while reinforcing its reputation as a forward-thinking financial hub. The index series calculates the prices of cryptocurrencies using a 24-hour volume-weighted average from major global exchanges. <strong>Updated daily at 4:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time, it provides real-time benchmarks in US dollars, aligning regional crypto standards with international markets.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThis way, Hong Kong is bridging the gap between traditional finance and the growing world of cryptocurrencies. Now, we can say that HKEX supports the healthy development of the virtual asset market while solidifying its leadership in financial innovation across Asia.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"tokenizationinsingapore\">Tokenization in Singapore</h2>\n<p>The Singapore Monetary Authority (MAS) has been a very active player in DLT over several years. In November 2024, it shared its plans to push the use of tokenization in finance. Tokenization means turning assets like stocks or bonds into digital tokens on a DLT, making them easier to trade. MAS wants to connect financial companies to make buying, selling, and settling tokenized assets smoother and faster.</p>\n<p>\\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:06.871Z-z06vpfjedzedmwx5l9dvk6r7\" alt=\"\" title=\"left-50\" /><strong><a href=\"https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation\">This initiative</a></strong> includes forming networks to boost liquidity, developing a supporting ecosystem for digital infrastructure, and enabling access to common settlement facilities for tokenized assets.** Through Project Guardian, over 40 institutions from seven regions are testing tokenization in various markets, including bonds, currencies, and funds.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe authority is also expanding its Global Layer One (GL1) initiative, which began in 2023. GL1 aims to create a seamless system for cross-border transactions by ensuring that market infrastructures are compatible. This will help tokenized assets to be traded internationally, with clear governance and risk management guidelines. Besides, MAS is also introducing a common settlement facility to enhance trust in tokenized transactions, using a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) for settlements.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"amultipurposecryptoecosystem\">A Multipurpose Crypto Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Of course, there are numerous DLT platforms at this point, but not all of them offer the same features, security, and decentralization levels. <strong><a href=\"https://obyte.org/\">Obyte</a></strong>, as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with a fully decentralized ecosystem, could be a good alternative to build numerous projects —individual or institutional.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Besides, while other DLT platforms have been chosen only for their efficiency, Obyte also empowers users with true freedom by using a decentralized Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) system, eliminating middlemen like miners or validators.</strong> This ensures fast, secure transactions without intermediaries or censorship risks. Beyond that, it’s a versatile crypto ecosystem, supporting a wide range of features.</p>\n<p>\\\n \\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-13T16:47:06.787Z-vcjqnhhywyivmtldn9cu261v\" alt=\"\" /><strong><a href=\"https://obyte.org/platform/tokens\">Tokenization</a></strong>, for instance, is one of its main features, allowing users to issue tokens easily, representing any asset, like stocks or bonds, without complicated processes or high costs. These tokens can be customized for different environments, making Obyte an ideal solution for regulated industries requiring compliance features, average users seeking ease of use, or advanced users looking for privacy.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/discovering-the-power-of-obyte-top-business-use-cases-revealed\">In supply chain management</a></strong>, Obyte’s technology can ensure transparency and trust. Each step in the movement of goods can be recorded on the platform, from raw materials to final product delivery. Furthermore, Obyte supports <strong><a href=\"https://obyte.org/platform/identity\">self-sovereign identity</a></strong>, enabling individuals to manage and share their personal data securely. With Obyte, users can have their identities verified by trusted parties and then share only the necessary details, keeping the rest private.</p>\n<p>\\\nThese features empower both individuals and institutions by eliminating intermediaries and giving users full control over their data and transactions. With Obyte's decentralized structure, there’s no central authority that can alter or manipulate the system, ensuring transparency and trust at every level.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\n<em>Featured Vector Image by <strong><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/isometric-smart-city-background_4441699.htm\">Freepik</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\n </p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Biden administration proposes sweeping new restrictions on exporting AI chips","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/biden-administration-proposes-sweeping-new-restrictions-on-exporting-ai-chips/","date":1736786563,"author":"Rebecca Szkutak","unread":true,"content":"<p>With a week left in office, President Joe Biden introduced a new set of guidelines and restrictions for exporting U.S.-made AI chips.

That's why tools like Flixier, Synthesia,  and Canva are exploding. They're not trying to replace Premiere - they're trying to help people who just need to get shit done without selling a kidney.</p>\n<p>\\\nI forced myself to use browser editors for a month and the feeling now? It works for quick social posts. Simple as that. Flixier works for basic/advanced edits and some of its pretty nice AI features. No crashes. No lag.</p>\n<p>\\\nSynthesia is perfect for that perfect avatar of yours if you’re dreading filming yourself or for those corporate and onboarding videos.</p>\n<p>\\\nCanva's templates make even my trash footage look semi-professional. For most people posting on social media, this is probably enough. 4K editing is where things get real. Most editors choke immediately, but Flixier surprised me. It handled my footage better than expected - still not perfect, but smooth enough to actually work with.

But $10-15 a month for Flixier or Canva is a lot easier to swallow than Adobe's Creative Cloud ransom demands + and I'm really skeptical that I've completely uninstalled it from my laptop…There are countless <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/1d8v6jq/impossible_to_uninstall_adobe/\">threads on Reddit</a> complaining about this bit. With online tools, you simply get what you pay for, and that's exactly what you need.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Harsh Truth</p>\n<p>\\\nThe cloud is just a computer in some warehouse in Texas. But maybe that's not so bad. Your projects are backed up automatically. You can edit from anywhere. Sure, every upload burns some energy, but so does running a 1000W gaming PC for editing.</p>\n<p>\\\nCollaboration actually works most of the time.

But I'm also keeping Flixier bookmarked for quick edits and Canva for when I need something to look good fast.

Evaluation on downstream tasks</h2>\n<p>In order to compare to other models in the literature, we train all our models for 300B tokens before evaluating on downstream tasks. The two external baselines that we compare to are Mamba-3B (Gu and Dao, 2023), the strongest small recurrent model reported in the literature to date, and Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), a widely used open Transformer model. Both external baselines have been trained on significantly more than 300B tokens – Mamba has been trained on 600B tokens, twice more, and Llama-2 has been trained on 2T tokens, nearly seven times more. We note however that both Mamba and Llama-2 were trained on different datasets and with different hyper-parameter tuning strategies, which may partially explain our strong performance. We therefore also include our own MQA transformer baseline, trained on the same data and with the same hyper-parameter tuning budget as Hawk and Griffin.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe provide an evaluation on downstream tasks in Table 1. We find that both Hawk and Griffin achieve very strong performance. In line with other works, we report character normalized accuracy on MMLU, HellaSwag, PIQA, ARC-E and ARC-C, while we report absolute accuracy on WinoGrande with partial scoring. The performance of Hawk improves significantly as we increase the model size, and Hawk-3B achieves stronger performance on downstream tasks than Mamba-3B, despite being trained on half as many tokens. Griffin-3B significantly outperforms Mamba-3B, and Griffin-7B and Griffin-14B achieve performance competitive with Llama-2, despite being trained on nearly 7 times fewer tokens. Hawk is also competitive with our MQA Transformer baseline, while Griffin outperforms this baseline.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"From WhatsApp to Web3: How Kaia is Turning 200M Asian Users into Crypto Natives","url":"https://hackernoon.com/from-whatsapp-to-web3-how-kaia-is-turning-200m-asian-users-into-crypto-natives?source=rss","date":1736785684,"author":"Ishan Pandey","unread":true,"content":"<p>In an exclusive interview, Eddie Kim and Ashwani, the visionaries building <a href=\"https://www.kaia.io/\">Kaia</a>, share their journey from traditional sectors to spearheading one of the most ambitious blockchain projects in Southeast Asia.

From addressing the challenges of gig workers in Indonesia to creating innovative Mini Dapps within messaging platforms, Kaia's approach offers a unique glimpse into the future of digital transformation in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: Hi Eddie Kim and Ashwani, welcome to our 'Behind the Startup' series. Please share about your journey and what drew you to blockchain technology. We would love to hear about your experience in Kaia?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Eddie</strong>: Before entering the Web3 industry, I worked in the international development sector with various organizations, including UNICEF, WHO, the UN Secretariat, and ASEAN. My role was to support the sustainable development of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. One of the biggest challenges in this sector is the slow pace of change—it often takes years to see the tangible results of your efforts. The only notable exception is projects involving the introduction of new technology. When a country or community adopts innovative technology, the impact on people's lives can be immediate and transformative. This realization fueled my interest in focusing on technology and innovation.</p>\n<p>\\\nDuring the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was in Indonesia, separated from my wife and son in Korea for over a year. That challenging and isolating experience led me to reevaluate my priorities. I decided to leave my position at ASEAN and return to Korea, even without a clear plan in place. After discussing my decision with my supervisor, I began exploring job opportunities in Korea, particularly in the ICT sector.</p>\n<p>\\\nAround that time, a friend introduced me to the Web3 industry, sparking my interest in blockchain technology. The Kaia team (then the Klaytn team) was seeking someone to lead the decentralization process of the Kaia chain. My experience with international organizations and my academic background in governance made me an excellent fit for the role. This is how I transitioned into the Web3 industry.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Before I started my Web3 Journey, I worked mainly in the Banking industry as Head of data analytics and architecture for DBS, VISA, BNP Paribas, JPMC. My role was to understand the data needs from various departments and provide different solutions based on their needs. One of the biggest challenges for the Banking sector was a lot of regulations that made processes slow and expensive.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs I was part of the banking industry for almost a decade, I understand the banking shortfalls and importance of decentralization in this industry. For instance, just to transfer a thousand dollars from one country to another country, banks charge approx thirty to forty dollars as fees and take a couple of days to process the transactions. I learned about Bitcoin in 2013 but did not pay much attention but I got involved in the crypto industry in 2017. I got excited to understand about faster payments, low fees, and decentralization.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn 2021, I started exploring opportunities in the blockchain space to go deep into this sector. I came to know about Kaia (back then Klaytn) from a job portal in Singapore. I came to know about Kakao and how big companies are moving towards blockchain. This is how I moved from traditional finance to blockchain space.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: Kaia emerged from the chain merge with Klaytn. How does this evolution impact your goals for the platform's ecosystem and governance?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Eddie</strong>: Kaia emerged from the chain merger between Klaytn and Finschia. Klaytn was initiated by Kakao Group, renowned for its super app KakaoTalk, while Finschia was initiated by LINE Group, known for its own super app, LINE. Since both chains were developed by messenger companies, they shared a common goal: bringing Web2 users into Web3 through their messenger applications. This alignment of vision significantly facilitated a smooth technical and organizational merger.</p>\n<p>\\\nFrom a governance perspective, we were fortunate as well. Both chains operated under a council-based governance model, with governance councils composed of global enterprises and ecosystem leaders successful in their respective chains. To consolidate, we simply merged the two councils into one unified governance structure. Again, we were fortunate that stakeholders from both chains aligned on the policies and strategic priorities of the new chain, which played a crucial role in making the merger a resounding success.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ashwani</strong>: As mentioned earlier, Kakao and Line groups are interested in exploring opportunities with newer technologies like blockchain with the same mission to bring more messenger users to blockchain to provide more transparency. With this merger, it will provide us more global experience and to understand and cater users in the SEA region. Klaytn was more prominent in Korea but with Line, it will expand to countries like Japan, Thailand and Taiwan.</p>\n<p>\\\nBoth companies worked on the council model for governance so merger was easier to align the common goals and directions. Council members are global enterprise and big web 3 companies. With this merger, Kaia ecosystem expanded to a bigger and stronger ecosystem.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: What differentiates Kaia's approach to blockchain ecosystem development from other platforms, particularly in emerging markets like Southeast Asia?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Eddie</strong>: Before discussing our approach to the Southeast Asian market as Head of Southeast Asia, I'd like to highlight our Kaia Wave program. Following the chain merger, we engaged in extensive discussions on how to maximize the value and momentum created by the merger. The conclusion was to leverage one of our strongest assets: LINE Messenger. Specifically, we decided to enable developers to build Mini Dapps directly on the LINE messaging app platform.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis decision was influenced by the success of TON and Telegram, but we believe we can achieve even more. Unlike Telegram, which is primarily used by Web3-native users, LINE is an integral part of everyday life for Web2 users—our families and friends rely on it for daily communication. Through this initiative, we aim to bring Web3 closer to everyday life, making it an accessible and meaningful part of people's routines.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis belief drove the launch of the Kaia Wave program, a builder support initiative designed to ensure that high-quality Mini Dapps are developed on the Kaia chain and integrated into LINE Messenger. Since the program's launch in September, we've received over 700 applications, and we are in the process of selecting the best products to feature on the first day of our Mini Dapp ecosystem launch via the Dapp Portal within the LINE messenger.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn terms of market entry strategy, we take a localization-first approach, as we recognize that each market has unique needs and desires. For example:</p>\n<p>\\\nVietnam, one of our priority markets, has a developer-centric ecosystem. After intensive market research and interviews with local partners, we learned that many developers aspire to replicate the success of Axie Infinity (though they no longer explicitly state this ambition). To support this vision, we established a local team in Vietnam to assist developers in building on the Kaia chain and achieving their goals.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Philippines has a gamer-oriented market. Gamers there often dream of creating large gaming guilds like YGG. In response, we focus on collaborating with local game guilds, helping them expand their communities and integrate into our Web3 gaming ecosystem.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis market-specific approach is how we build ecosystems tailored to local needs. Now, I am in India to better understand the dreams and aspirations of the Indian market and to explore how we can align our initiatives with its unique opportunities.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Kaia sets itself apart in blockchain development for Southeast Asia by focusing on accessibility, integration with popular platforms, and real-world applications. Its standout feature is embedding blockchain services into messaging apps like LINE and KakaoTalk, which have extensive user bases in the region. This integration lowers barriers to entry by enabling users to access wallets and decentralized applications (dApps) directly within familiar platforms, eliminating the need for specialized(technical) knowledge.</p>\n<p>\\\nKaia supports developers with tools like the NEXT WEB SDK and the Kaia Wave program, which offers funding and mentorship. These initiatives foster innovation, helping create tailored applications for Southeast Asian markets. Additionally, Kaia bridges traditional finance and blockchain through the tokenization of real-world assets such as gold, real estate, and ships, enhancing liquidity and expanding investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy leveraging strategic partnerships, Kaia ensures robust ecosystem support and scalability. Its user-centric approach aligns with the high mobile adoption and digital engagement in Southeast Asia, making blockchain more accessible to everyday users. With its blend of Web2 familiarity and Web3 innovation, Kaia positions itself as a leader in the region, driving adoption and creating practical, inclusive use cases for blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: With your background in sustainable development and analytics, how do you see blockchain, specifically Kaia, addressing pressing global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and climate change in Southeast Asia?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Eddie</strong>: Frankly speaking, Kaia is still a startup, and like most startups, our primary focus is on ensuring the success of the Kaia chain. While ESG considerations are not our immediate focus, they remain important and will naturally follow as we achieve a certain level of success.</p>\n<p>That said, this does not mean Kaia is not contributing to addressing global challenges. In fact, we are already witnessing meaningful use cases where blockchain technology is making a positive impact on sustainable development issues. For example, one of our portfolio companies in Indonesia is leveraging blockchain technology to promote financial inclusion.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis company addresses the significant challenge faced by gig workers in accessing traditional financial services. In Indonesia, most banks do not provide loans to gig workers, even when they have regular incomes. To solve this, the company offers microfinance solutions to gig workers and records loan repayment transactions on the Kaia chain as NFTs. These NFTs serve as a verifiable record of financial behavior.</p>\n<p>\\\nThrough partnerships with local banks, they aim to ensure that these NFTs can be used as a reference for gig workers to access traditional loans. This innovative use of blockchain technology highlights how Kaia's ecosystem can contribute to addressing real-world challenges, even at this early stage of our journey.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Kaia leverages blockchain's transparency and decentralization to address poverty, inequality, and climate change in Southeast Asia. By enabling financial inclusion through decentralized finance (DeFi) and low-cost remittances, Kaia aims to unbanked populations. It ensures transparency and supports decentralized governance, giving communities control over resources. Through tokenized assets (e.q, tokenization of ships in Indonesia), it unlocks investment opportunities, while its analytics measure impact and optimize resource allocation.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: Southeast Asia is known for its rapidly growing tech-savvy population. What strategies are you employing to foster grassroots adoption of Kaia's blockchain technology in the region?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Eddie Kim</strong>: I believe I've already addressed this question earlier, but I'd like to add one more important point—our partnership strategy. We consistently strive to identify local partners with strong community and developer relationships and invite them to become governance council members. By doing so, these local partners become key stakeholders in the Kaia chain.</p>\n<p>\\\nThese partners act as our representatives in their respective markets, engaging with the local community and helping us design tailored strategies that resonate with local needs. Moreover, they play a crucial role in building additional partnerships with key players in the region, ensuring that our approach remains localized and effective.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: How do you leverage your experience with international organizations like the ASEAN Secretariat and UNICEF to build partnerships that align Kaia's expansion goals with regional development priorities?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Eddie Kim</strong>: With nearly a decade of experience in the region, I have developed a strong understanding of its dynamics. While my work primarily involved interacting with the public sector—including government agencies, international organizations, and think tanks—I have always made it a point to observe and understand the market and local communities as well.</p>\n<p>\\\nMy extensive travels across the region allowed me to experience its diversity firsthand. These experiences have given me a unique intuition about the region, which has proven valuable in prioritizing resources and building partnerships. Over the past four years, this intuition has guided me effectively, helping us establish meaningful collaborations.</p>\n<p>\\\nI am optimistic that this same approach will enable me to identify the right partner in India to support our expansion efforts.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: As Head of Ecosystem, what specific steps are you taking to attract developers and projects to Kaia, and how do you ensure that these partnerships lead to sustainable growth for the ecosystem?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ashwani</strong>: As Head of Ecosystem at Kaia, the focus is on attracting developers and projects while ensuring sustainable growth through robust support, funding, and practical use cases.</p>\n<p>\\\nKaia provides developer-friendly tools like the NEXT WEB SDK, Kaia Wallet SDK, and Wallet Market API, enabling seamless dApp creation and integration with popular platforms like LINE and KakaoTalk. Comprehensive documentation and responsive technical support further reduce barriers for developers.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo incentivize participation, Kaia offers initiatives such as the Kaia Wave program, providing up to $1.2 million in funding and mentorship. Hackathons and competitions foster innovation and visibility, while a vibrant developer community encourages collaboration. Kaia drives real-world applications by supporting asset tokenization, enabling projects to create tangible value in sectors like real estate and logistics.</p>\n<p>\\\nStrategic partnerships with LINE NEXT and others expand the ecosystem's reach, while targeted collaborations align projects with market demand.</p>\n<p>\\\nSustainable growth is ensured through revenue-sharing models, user adoption incentives, and analytics to help developers refine applications. By promoting user-centric solutions and aligning incentives, Kaia fosters long-term engagement from both developers and users.</p>\n<p>\\\nKaia's blend of incentives, tools, and real-world focus creates a thriving ecosystem, bridging blockchain innovation with practical adoption, particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ishan Pandey</strong>: What role does interoperability play in your strategy for Kaia's ecosystem growth, and how do you plan to position Kaia as a key player in the multichain future?</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ashwani</strong>: Interoperability is central to Kaia's strategy for ecosystem growth, enabling seamless interaction across blockchains, applications, and users. By prioritizing multichain functionality, Kaia positions itself as a key player in the Web3 multichain future, fostering usability, innovation, and connectivity.</p>\n<p>\\\nKaia supports cross-chain interactions by developing bridge infrastructure, allowing assets, data, and transactions to move freely across networks. Tools like multichain-compatible SDKs enable developers to build applications that operate across ecosystems, maximizing reach and utility.</p>\n<p>\\\nStrategic partnerships with major blockchains and adoption of interoperability standards, such as Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), ensure compatibility and security. Kaia enhances user experience with cross-chain wallets and unified APIs, simplifying multichain asset management and dApp creation.</p>\n<p>\\\nInteroperability also drives real-world applications like the tokenization of assets (e.g., real estate or commodities), expanding liquidity and use cases in sectors like finance, gaming, and supply chain.</p>\n<p>\\\nKaia positions itself as a multichain hub by facilitating cross-chain liquidity aggregation, providing developer incentives for interoperable projects, and ensuring secure, transparent governance. With a user- and developer-focused approach, Kaia is set to become a pivotal player in the multichain Web3 landscape, enabling scalable blockchain adoption and innovation.</p>\n<p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story! </p>\n<p>:::tip\n<strong>Vested Interest Disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://business.hackernoon.com/business-blogging/?ref=hackernoon.com#buy\">business blogging program</a></strong>.

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/1900-6418327/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/123/1239113/4426475-dynastywarriorsorigins2.jpg","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Griffin Models: Outperforming Transformers with Scalable AI Innovation","url":"https://hackernoon.com/griffin-models-outperforming-transformers-with-scalable-ai-innovation?source=rss","date":1736785430,"author":"Gating","unread":true,"content":"<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Soham De, Google DeepMind and with Equal contributions;</p>\n<p>(2) Samuel L.

Additional Details of the Copy and Retrieval Tasks</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"31scalingcurves\">3.1. Scaling curves</h2>\n<p>We present our main scaling results in Figure 1(a). All three model families are trained at a range of model scales from 100M to 7B parameters, with an additional Griffin model with 14 billion parameters. We increase the number of training tokens to be roughly proportional to the number of parameters of the model, as prescribed by the Chinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Models are trained on the MassiveText dataset (Hoffmann et al., 2022), previously used to train Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) and Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), although we use a slightly different data subset distribution. A sequence length of 2048 tokens was used (see Section 6 for results with longer sequences.) All experiments use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). We tune the learning rate, weight decay and 𝛽2 parameters for small models, and use these runs to identify scaling rules for these hyper-parameters which predict their optimal values for the 7B and 14B models.</p>\n<p>\\\nAll three model families demonstrate a linear scaling relationship between the validation loss and training FLOPs (see Figure 1(a); note both axes are in log scale), as previously observed for Transformers by Brown et al. (2020). Notably, Griffin achieves lower validation loss than the Transformer baseline across all FLOPs budgets despite not using any global attention layers. Hawk on the other hand achieves slightly higher validation loss, but this gap appears to close as the training budget increases.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-2r83vti.png\" alt=\"Table 1 | Character normalized accuracy. Hawk is competitive with our Transformer baseline, and exceeds the reported performance of Mamba despite being trained on half as many tokens. Griffin outperforms our Transformer baseline, and matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on roughly 7 times fewer tokens. We report unnormalized accuracy with partial scoring for WinoGrande.\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Xiaohongshu, China’s answer to Instagram, hits No. 1 on the App Store as TikTok faces US shutdown","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/xiaohongshu-chinas-answer-to-instagram-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store-as-tiktok-faces-us-shutdown/","date":1736785410,"author":"Lauren Forristal","unread":true,"content":"<p>On the heels of TikTok&#8217;s looming shut down on January 19 over its ownership in the U.S. (unless the Supreme Court intervenes), it looks like another Chinese app is catching some attention.

In the expanding world of blockchain, where every digital asset is a potential entry point, the <a href=\"https://gopluslabs.io/\">GoPlus Foundation</a> aims to deliver that lock. The <a href=\"https://gopluslabs.io/\">GoPlus</a> today announced its native utility token, $GPS, designed to unify and secure the GoPlus Security Network. This development marks GoPlus’s evolution from a centralized service to a decentralized security infrastructure protecting transactions across diverse blockchain ecosystems.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe $GPS token underpins what <a href=\"https://gopluslabs.io/\">GoPlus</a> calls its “Secure Universe,” a network architecture focused on transaction safety. Through this new structure, the Foundation seeks to encourage active community participation, allowing anyone to contribute security data and bolster the system’s defenses. The Foundation envisions a future where security becomes a common resource, accessible to users and developers on any chain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Bybit_Official/status/1878743820231213285?embedable=true\">https://x.com/Bybit_Official/status/1878743820231213285?embedable=true</a></p>\n<p>\\\nThe move represents GoPlus’s transformation from a centralized service provider to a decentralized security network—a development that recalls the way expanding cities once required new defensive measures to safeguard their growing populations. In that same spirit, GoPlus aims to secure every transaction in an ever-accelerating Web3 universe.</p>\n<p>\\\nSince its inception in 2020, GoPlus has processed more than 30 million security detection requests daily across 30 or more blockchains, protecting tens of billions of dollars in digital assets. Its services are trusted by leading wallets, decentralized exchanges, and diverse projects, with over 10,000 developers and protocols relying on GoPlus solutions. Observers note this trust as a foundation on which GoPlus can now build a fully decentralized model, enabling broader participation in securing the network.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe newly introduced (GPS) token underpins GoPlus’s ambition to create a “Secure Universe,” where every transaction is continuously protected. Individuals can use (GPS) for security service fees, while enterprises can access advanced security APIs by paying in the token. In addition, projects can tap into the SafeToken Protocol for secure liquidity management, also settled in (GPS). The token encourages active participation in maintaining the network, allowing contributors to stake (GPS) to operate security service nodes or provide security data; in return, they earn rewards for supporting the infrastructure. Early participants will have access to additional incentives through staking and contribution programs that further align the interests of users and developers.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe total supply of (GPS) is capped at 10 billion tokens. GoPlus Foundation has segmented the distribution as follows: 24.67 percent goes to Community and Development; 10 percent to Ecosystem Growth; 6 percent to Marketing and Growth; 10 percent to Airdrops; 7 percent to Liquidity; 3 percent to Advisors; and 39.33 percent allocated to initial contributors and private investors. Officials at GoPlus regard this breakdown as essential to balancing the needs of the community at large with those of early backers, aiming for long-term value rather than short-term speculation.</p>\n<p>\\\nBuilding upon the widespread use of its existing services, GoPlus now seeks to deepen its decentralized architecture. By embedding (GPS) as the cornerstone of its security network, the Foundation aspires to align incentives across developers, node operators, and end-users. The organization believes this collaborative model will help tackle the ever-increasing challenges of safeguarding digital assets amid the rapid evolution of blockchain applications.</p>\n<p>\\\nDetailed information on the Token Generation Event (TGE), including timelines, participation mechanics, and extended product features, will be released in the near future. Industry participants emphasize that this development may mark a pivotal juncture in the realm of blockchain security, underscoring the growing demand for robust, user-focused defenses. GoPlus Foundation remains committed to providing a secure, inclusive ecosystem, a mission that gains momentum through the introduction of (GPS).</p>\n<p>\\\nGoPlus Foundation is a recognized leader in Web3 security. Its offerings cover all stages of on-chain transactions, aiming to protect users every step of the way. Services tailored for wallets, decentralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, and public blockchains represent the organization’s broader strategy: to establish a global safeguard network that any project or user can access.</p>\n<p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story!</p>\n<p>:::tip\n<strong>Vested Interest Disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://business.hackernoon.com/business-blogging/?ref=hackernoon.com#buy\">business blogging program</a></strong>.

Recurrent Models Scale as Efficiently as Transformers</h2>\n<p>Scaling studies provide important insights into how to tune the hyperparameters of a model and its behaviour at scale. Here, we define the models evaluated in our studies, and provide scaling curves up to and beyond 7B parameters. Finally, we assess the performance of our models on downstream tasks. We consider 3 model families in this work; (1) a MQA-Transformer baseline, (2) Hawk; our pure RNN model, and (3) Griffin; our hybrid model which mixes recurrent blocks with local attention. We define the key model hyper-parameters for models across a range of scales in Appendix C.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>MQA Transformer baseline</strong> Our Transformer baseline uses the residual pattern and the gated MLP block described in Section 2, in combination with MQA (Shazeer, 2019) and RoPE (Su et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-k883vd3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Griffin</strong> The key advantage of recurrent blocks over global attention is that they use a fixed state size to summarize the sequence, whereas the size of MQA’s KV cache grows proportional to sequence length. Since local attention (Section2.3) has the same property, mixing recurrent blocks with local attention preserves this benefit. We have found this combination extremely effective, since local attention accurately models the recent past, while the recurrent layers can transmit information across long sequences.</p>\n<p>\\\nGriffin uses the same residual pattern and MLP block as our Transformer baseline. However unlike both our MQA Transformer baseline and the Hawk model, Griffin uses a mixture of recurrent blocks and MQA blocks. Specifically, we employ a layered structure by alternating two residual blocks with a recurrent block followed by one residual block which uses the local (MQA) attention block described in Section 2.3.

Additional Details of the Copy and Retrieval Tasks</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"2modelarchitecture\">2. Model Architecture</h2>\n<p>All our models contain the following components: (i) a residual block, (ii) an MLP block, and (iii) a temporal-mixing block. While (i) and (ii) are the same across all models, we consider three temporal mixing blocks: global Multi-Query Attention (MQA), local (sliding-window) MQA and our proposed recurrent block. As part of the recurrent block we use the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU) – a novel recurrent layer inspired by the Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023b).</p>\n<p>\\\nThe residual block, as shown in Figure 2(a), defines the global structure of our models and is inspired by pre-norm Transformers (Xiong et al., 2020). After embedding the input sequence we pass it through 𝑁 such blocks (𝑁 denoting the model depth), and then we apply RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) to produce the final activations. To compute the token probabilities we apply a final linear layer followed by a softmax. The weights of this layer are shared with the input embedding layer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"21residualblock\">2.1. Residual block</h3>\n<p>The residual block contains two components, applied in order. The first component takes the hidden state 𝑥 and applies an RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), followed by the temporal-mixing block.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-p183vyg.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 | a) The main backbone of our mode architecture is the residual block, which is stacked 𝑁 times. b) The gated MLP block that we use. c) The recurrent block that we propose as an alternative to Multi Query Attention (MQA). It uses our proposed RG-LRU layer, defined in Section 2.4.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nWe then merge the output with a skip connection from 𝑥 through addition. Similarly, the second component applies RMSNorm, followed by the MLP block and then merges its output with a skip connection from the input of the RMSNorm. This block is illustrated in Figure 2 (a).</p>\n<h3 id=\"22mlpblock\">2.2. MLP block</h3>\n<p>We use a gated MLP block (Dauphin et al., 2017) (illustrated in Figure 2(b)), which creates two branches from its input of dimension 𝐷. We apply a linear layer with output dimension 𝑀𝐷 on each branch, where 𝑀 denotes the expansion factor. For simplicity, we use 𝑀 =3 throughout this work. We apply a GeLU non-linearity (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) on one of the branches before merging them by element-wise multiplication, similar to GeGeLU (Shazeer, 2020). However, in our MLP block, we apply a final linear layer with output dimension 𝐷 on the outputs of the GeGeLU layer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23temporalmixingblocks\">2.3. Temporal-mixing blocks</h3>\n<p>The temporal-mixing block is the component of our model that aggregates hidden layer activations at different temporal locations in the sequence. We consider three temporal-mixing blocks: global MQA (Shazeer, 2019), local MQA (Beltagy et al., 2020) and our proposed Recurrent block.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-md93vpo.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Local sliding window attention</strong> One of the key disadvantages of using global attention is that its computational complexity grows quadratically in the sequence length. To address this, several works have started to adopt local attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), also known as sliding window attention. It allows each position to attend only to a fixed number of tokens in the past. This not only reduces the computational FLOPs but also bounds the size of the KV cache to the size of window, making it no longer quadratic in the sequence length. All other details are the same as the global MQA.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-n2a3vhb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"24realgatedlinearrecurrentunitrglru\">2.4.

Additional Details of the Copy and Retrieval Tasks</a></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have fast inference and scale efficiently on long sequences, but they are difficult to train and hard to scale. We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) played a central role in the early days of deep learning and NLP research (Elman, 1990; Siegelmann and Sontag, 1991; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Mikolov et al., 2010; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), and achieved practical success in many applications, including Google’s first end to end machine translation system (Wu et al., 2016). However in recent years, both deep learning and NLP have been dominated by the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which interleaves multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and multi-head attention (MHA). Transformers achieve better performance than RNNs in practice and are also very efficient at utilizing modern hardware (Kaplan et al., 2020). Transformer-based large language models trained on massive datasets collected from the web have achieved remarkable success (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Gemini Team Google, 2023).</p>\n<p>\\\nDespite their successes, Transformers are difficult to scale efficiently to long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of global attention. Additionally, the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with the sequence length makes Transformers slow during inference. Although Multi-Query Attention (MQA) (Shazeer, 2019) partially mitigates this issue by reducing the cache size by a constant factor, the cache still grows linearly in sequence length. Recurrent language models present a compelling alternative as they compress the entire sequence into a fixed-sized hidden state which is updated iteratively. However to replace Transformers, new RNN models must demonstrate not only comparable performance at scale but also achieve similar hardware efficiency (Gu et al., 2021a; Mehta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022; Orvieto et al., 2023b; Dao et al., 2022b; Poli et al., 2023; Gu and Dao, 2023).</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this work, we propose the RG-LRU layer, a novel gated linear recurrent layer, around which we design a new recurrent block to replace MQA. We build two new models using this recurrent block: Hawk, a model which interleaves MLPs with recurrent blocks, and Griffin, a hybrid model which interleaves MLPs with a mixture of recurrent blocks and local attention (Beltagy et al., 2020). We show that:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Hawk and Griffin exhibit power law scaling between held-out loss and training FLOPs, up to and beyond 7B parameters (Figure 1(a)), as previously observed for Transformers (Kaplan et al., 2020).</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Griffin achieves slightly lower held-out loss than strong Transformer baselines at all model scales.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ol83vsm.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 | a) Hawk, Griffin and our MQA Transformer baseline all show power law scaling between held-out loss and training FLOPs, with Griffin achieving the lowest held-out loss at all FLOPs budgets. The largest Griffin model shown has 14B parameters. b) Hawk and Griffin achieve significantly higher throughput than our MQA Transformer, especially when the length of the sample increases.\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>We overtrain Hawk and Griffin on 300B tokens at a range of model scales. Hawk-3B exceeds the reported performance of Mamba-3B (Gu and Dao, 2023) on downstream tasks, despite being trained on half as many tokens. Griffin-7B and Griffin-14B match the performance of Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) despite being trained on roughly 7 times fewer tokens (Section 3.2).</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Both Hawk and Griffin achieve comparable training efficiency to Transformers on TPU-v3. Since diagonal RNN layers are memory bound, we achieve this with a kernel for the RG-LRU layer, implemented in Pallas (Bradbury et al., 2018), that minimizes memory transfers (Section 4).</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>During inference, both Hawk and Griffin achieve significantly higher throughput than MQA Transformers (Figure 1(b)), and they achieve lower latency when sampling long sequences (Section 5).</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Griffin performs better than Transformers when evaluated on sequences longer than those seen during training, and can also efficiently learn copying and retrieval tasks from training data (Section 6). However, Hawk and Griffin perform less well than Transformers when we evaluate pre-trained models on copying and exact-retrieval tasks without fine-tuning.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"I Over Relied on AI and Those Shortcuts Cost Me","url":"https://hackernoon.com/i-over-relied-on-ai-and-those-shortcuts-cost-me?source=rss","date":1736783430,"author":"Lisa Kim","unread":true,"content":"<p>30th of November in 2022 is the day I embraced ChatGPT with no hesitation as my colleague, editor, and assistant. “What can I help with?” has become the most relieving sentence that’s welcomed me to work for the past two years.</p>\n<p>\\\nMany of my workflows began with prompts like “Give me ideas” or “Show me the steps on how I can,” and often ended with “Find improvements” or “Revise this text for a final draft.” Tasks that once demanded hours of deliberation and decision-making now flowed seamlessly, allowing me to reclaim precious time with more work.</p>\n<p>\\\nI became the ultimate master of ‘getting things done’ delivering over 5 growth campaigns within the first 9 months of my first full-time job in the blockchain industry, and authoring 7 articles about quantum computing technology when I had no prior knowledge on it.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor two years, not a single task crossed the finish line without an A.I.’s input. Now, as I build my blockchain marketing portfolio, I’m struck by how effective my AI-assisted work has been—consistently achieving results that were 'good enough.' However, I also notice what’s missing: the bold uniqueness and true innovation that make work unforgettable.</p>\n<p>\\\nGenerative A.I., after all, is trained on existing data and generates responses by predicting and reproducing patterns in the most contextually familiar way.</p>\n<p>\\\nChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity are not at fault for the lack of boldness and uniqueness in my portfolio. Their familiarity-preferring algorithms, and predictive methods imitating online text are in fact strikingly similar to how our brains work to reach solutions of creativity.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn fact, Aristotle once said that art and creativity often stem from mimicking nature or other works. Confucian philosophies also valued learning and imitation, but only as a means of mastering knowledge before creating something new.</p>\n<p>\\\nObserving myself in retrospect, I concluded that the lack of uniqueness in my marketing portfolio was solely my accountability. I had over-relied on AI, hooked on the rush of it giving me fast answers that boosted my productivity, churning out deliverables like clockwork. I was vaping my way through prompts and answers, giving myself artificial injections of dopamine and serotonin that could have otherwise naturally come from thinking deeply about something for a long-time and finally reaching a satisfying conclusion.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In the past two years, ChatGPT has undergone 23 updates, each significantly improving its accuracy, reasoning, and problem-solving capabilities since its public release. As for my own updates? Productivity, definitely—but reasoning, problem-solving, and accuracy? Maybe, though none as transformative as ChatGPT's evolution.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zozISNvPY6Xa14qQbao4YxXdCAd2-sy03995.png\" alt=\"A summary of OpenAI's ChatGPT updates since Nov, 2022\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAI is designed to replicate the solutions we might reach with more time, making it easy to delegate tasks like reasoning, problem-solving, and ensuring accuracy. At first glance, this might not seem harmful. But the truth is, ==the process matters more than the outcome.== Destinations reached through AI shortcuts are inherently different from those achieved without it, even if they seem identical on the surface.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>After going through extensive research about mankind’s greatest achievements, I’ve concluded that the grueling thinking processes we delegate to AI in exchange for speed and efficiency is the key to cultivate a trait that AI, no matter how advanced, can never possess.</p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to philosophers such as Socrates, and Emmanuel Kant along with the Christian body, The Enlightenment Movement, and the pioneers of the Romanticism - there exists something in humans that transcends intelligence —a quality that designates certain individuals as exceptional and defines our ability to create and innovate. This essence, the very force that enabled us to bring AI into existence, must be nurtured to maintain our distinctiveness as a species.</p>\n<p>\\\nSocrates was among the first to articulate this concept, referring to it in Latin as “daimonion.” He described his daimonion as a guiding spirit, particularly in moral decisions. It was not a source of knowledge or intellect, but rather a moral compass that steered him away from improper behavior. Paradoxically, it was Socrates’ humility and acknowledgment of his own ignorance—his famous belief that he knew nothing—that set him apart and elevated his wisdom above that of his peers.</p>\n<p>\\\n==The term \"daimonion\" would later be translated into English as “<strong>genius</strong>.”==</p>\n<p>\\\n‘Genius’ is a word that most of us cannot relate to, as it has become a term heavily used by the PR/Marketing specialists of the most successful people of the world. Today, it often serves as a convenient excuse for bad behavior, overshadowing its deeper significance. Modern cognitive science has further diluted the concept by framing human cognition in measurable terms—processing speed, memory, and problem-solving ability—reducing genius to mere variations of quantifiable traits.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, the concept of genius predates modern intelligence theories, and was initially linked to spiritual or otherworldly guidance rather than intellect. It was never synonymous to intelligence, as Socrates’ acknowledgement of his own ignorance (something A.I. is incapable of by the way) was celebrated as a form of genius - his humility, insight, and the ability to question deeply.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the Christian era, genius intertwined with spirituality, as mystic-saints sought unity with God. These figures believed in profound truths beyond intellectual comprehension, accessible through divine encounters or moments of ecstasy.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt wasn’t until The Enlightenment Movement in the 18th century that the term Genius became closer to the way we understand it today, shifting its focus from divine visitation to individual creativity. Immanuel Kant emphasized that true genius created transformative art by inspiration, not imitation or adherence to rules. For Kant, genius was not about technical skill but about originality—the ability to forge new paths and redefine the boundaries of human achievement.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Romantic movement further elevated the concept of genius, celebrating it as a profound expression of human truths through intuition and inspiration. For them, genius was not just a personal attribute but a force that connected humanity to deeper, universal truths.</p>\n<p>\\\nFurther in the 20th century, figures like Albert Einstein, Kurt Gödel, John von Neumann, and J. Robert Oppenheimer were celebrated as scientific geniuses, not solely for their extraordinary intellectual achievements but for their ability to think intuitively and creatively in ways that reshaped our understanding of the world. Their work often seemed to stem from an almost mystical insight, a quality that aligned them with the Romantic notion of genius as an unquantifiable force capable of reaching beyond the constraints of formal logic.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As is typical of modern science, which seeks to classify and quantify everything, most of us were excluded from the classification as a ‘genius’ and were left self-labeled “intelligent” at the most. And in quantifiable intelligence measures such as speed, and variety of solutions — A.I. has consistently outperformed us.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd over the past 20 years, films like <em>A Space Odyssey</em>, <em>iRobot</em>, and <em>The Terminator</em> have offered captivating predictions of a future where A.I. breaks their programmings and potentially overpowers humanity. This narrative fueled an instinctive yet false impression long before tools like ChatGPT were even introduced to the public. Our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_forecasting\">cultural prefiguration</a> of A.I. has not only blinded us to the possibility that humans might surpass A.I. in certain ways but has also prematurely defined A.I. as inherently superior to us.</p>\n<p>\\\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who has naturally found themselves taking the passenger’s seat at work while A.I. takes the wheel, thinking, “It’s better this way.”</p>\n<p>\\\nWe’ve rarely considered the genius we might bring to the table because we’ve never seen ourselves as geniuses. And maybe, scientifically speaking, we aren’t. But if genius were viewed as a spectrum rather than a binary (as many things are increasingly proven to be), humans would likely sit further along that spectrum than A.I.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>After all, no matter how advanced algorithms become in reasoning, problem-solving, or accuracy, they remain bound by predefined parameters, and rules while operating only within familiar frameworks incapable of calculating morals, intuition, inspiration and expression.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Moments that make genius seemingly possible from A.I. can be seen from media reports about A.I. hallucinations - when A.I. makes up information that appears factual. For example, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/science/ai-hallucinations-science.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\">this article</a> tells a story on how A.I. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/technology/chatbots-hallucination-rates.html\">hallucinations</a> have been beneficial to scientists for generating highly implausible yet novel (genius) ideas to tackle challenges, like designing entirely new molecules.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, A.I. hallucinations are nothing more than an error that can’t be controlled nor can be intentional. It is a joyous serendipity at the most, and cannot be described as genius.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd shouldn’t A.G.I. (the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can) be considered genius?</p>\n<p>\\\nNot really. A.I. was first introduced as an academic discipline in the 1950s at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence where participants aimed at creating machines capable of replicating human cognitive functions such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. A.G.I is just one of the pre-defined fundamentals of A.I. that’s being further developed.</p>\n<p>\\\nMaybe humans love A.I. so much because of how highly intelligent it can be without the possibility of it becoming a genius. And it’s perfectly fine to love A.I., as it stands as the genius invention of humanity—an incredible achievement of our kind.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Even after reading all this, you might be reluctant to admit that you are more ‘genius’ than A.I., especially if you’re a strong advocate of science that told you you’re not. Or it may be because the term raises discomfort that comes from the connotation of big ideas challenging societal norms. Figures like medieval saints and Socrates were often seen as dangerous, as they rejected societal conventions and sometimes faced execution for their defiance. This just shows how powerful our genius can be.</p>\n<p>\\\nBut Genius is not a test score, nor a quantifiable trait. ==Genius is not a cognitive function but rather a unique convergence of creativity, intuition, and insight that transcends raw intellectual abilities==. While cognitive functions like memory, reasoning, and problem-solving are essential components of intelligence, genius operates on a higher plane—marked by the ability to perceive connections, challenge conventions, and create transformative ideas. It is an expression of originality and vision that cannot be reduced to measurable mental processes, as it embodies qualities of inspiration, emotional resonance, and a capacity to innovate in ways that defy purely cognitive explanation.</p>\n<p>\\\nGenius begins as a brief spark during our problem-solving and reasoning processes—an instinctive moment of questioning that whispers, “but,” “what if,” “why not?” or “could it be?”</p>\n<p>\\\n==It’s this very genius—our capacity to explore and question intuitively beyond rationale—that we’re giving up in exchange for A.I.-generated shortcuts.==</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I wrote this story to share how I underestimated myself and overestimated A.I., in the hopes that you won’t make the same mistake. Since there is no manual on how to use A.I. properly, nor does a guide exist on how to balance our intelligence with that of A.I.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs A.I. has become an accessible tool for anyone over the age of 13, challenging ourselves has become a challenge in itself, with so many tempting shortcuts at our fingertips.</p>\n<p>\\\nBut perhaps, as long as we understand what sets us apart from this technology, we can avoid the discouragement and laziness that lead to over-reliance on it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Now that you know about the human-exclusive genius capabilities within you—capabilities that are fading in exchange for shortcuts—how will you adjust them?</strong></p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"New Startups Are Standing Out In a Hyper-competitive Market—Here's How","url":"https://hackernoon.com/new-startups-are-standing-out-in-a-hyper-competitive-marketheres-how?source=rss","date":1736782919,"author":"nimisha","unread":true,"content":"<p>Launching a product is always a thrilling yet daunting endeavor. But when your target market is crowded with established players and new entrants, the challenge becomes exponentially tougher.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen I worked at a startup, I was once tasked with solving a key problem for our users—a problem they were already addressing using a competitor’s product. Specifically, users were relying on a tool that excelled in automating report generation but lacked flexibility for real-time collaboration. My team identified this gap and set out to design a solution that integrated collaborative features, such as live document editing and instant feedback loops, which the competitor’s product didn’t offer. Breaking into such a saturated space felt like pushing a boulder uphill, but we learned to focus on delivering undeniable value.</p>\n<p>\\\nThat experience, coupled with my career journey of launching nearly 30 products across several companies, taught me invaluable lessons about navigating hyper-competitive markets. In this article, I’ll share the critical factors I’ve learned to consider when launching a product in a crowded market. These insights are designed to help you not just survive but thrive.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"1deeplyunderstandyourtargetmarket\">1. <strong>Deeply Understand Your Target Market</strong></h3>\n<p>In a competitive space, there is no room for guesswork. Start by conducting comprehensive research to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Identify underserved segments</strong>: For instance, while working on a rideshare platform, we discovered that users in suburban areas felt underserved compared to urban centers. Focusing on improved coverage in these areas created a unique opportunity to differentiate ourselves.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Analyze competitors’ strengths and weaknesses</strong>: Use tools like SWOT analysis to pinpoint areas where you can excel. For example, one competitor might have superior performance but lack intuitive user interfaces.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Validate your assumptions with real users</strong>: Engage directly with your audience through interviews, surveys, and user testing to ensure you’re solving a real problem. When launching a scheduling app, we discovered through user testing that the default calendar integrations were unintuitive, leading us to redesign how events were added.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example : Slack’s rise to fame during Covid!</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nWhen Slack entered the crowded communication tools market, they focused on delivering a seamless user experience for people by really understanding their problems and solving for them, thus distinguishing themselves from clunkier alternatives. For example, when Covid-19 hit, Slack helped maintain company culture by creating channels for informal chats and social interaction, reducing isolation and keeping morale high among remote employees. Because of extreme reliance on digital communication, email volumes surged, but Slack helped by centralizing communication, making it easier to track conversations and reduce inbox clutter. Slack did this better than most of it’s competitors.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/icrWDnjdvqZzEbKmMsYevbg5Qnu1-dt03449.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"2defineandcommunicateauniquevaluepropositionuvp\">2. <strong>Define and Communicate a Unique Value Proposition (UVP)</strong></h3>\n<p>Your product’s UVP is your weapon in a saturated market. It should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear</strong>: Avoid jargon and communicate in a way that resonates with your audience. For example, \"Save 10 hours a week with automated invoicing\" is clearer than \"Streamline your operational workflows.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Distinct</strong>: What makes your product irreplaceable? Sometimes it’s as simple as explaining how you solve a problem better.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: Ensure your messaging aligns across all channels—website, ads, emails, and product UI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use frameworks like the \"<strong>Jobs-to-be-Done</strong>\" theory to articulate what “<strong>job</strong>” your product accomplishes better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Example: Spotify reigning in the Music Streaming Market!</strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Job-to-be-Done</strong>: Music listeners need an easy, convenient way to discover, listen to, and manage their music collections across multiple devices without the hassle of downloading or managing files.</li>\n<li><strong>How Spotify does it better</strong>: In the hyper-competitive music streaming market, Spotify stands out by offering a seamless user experience with personalized playlists (like Discover Weekly) and a massive music library, all accessible across devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Why Spotify keeps winning:</strong> It continuously solves for music discovery and taste stagnation in the most creative ways getting better with each year. With a mature personalized playlist curation model, an AI-powered DJ and Wrapped, Spotify has truly learnt to stand out amongst competitors (YT music, Apple music etc.) whilst still solving for the same user problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-cl234jv.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"3prioritizespeedwithoutcompromisingquality\">3. <strong>Prioritize Speed Without Compromising Quality</strong></h3>\n<p>In hyper-competitive markets, time is of the essence. However, releasing a half-baked product can backfire. Strike a balance by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focusing on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong>: Build only the core features that deliver your UVP. For example, we launched a photo-editing app with just three standout filters that worked flawlessly, rather than overloading it with mediocre options.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopting agile development practices</strong>: Iterate quickly based on feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Testing thoroughly before launch</strong>: Ensure your product works seamlessly for the most critical use cases. For instance, before launching a payment gateway, we stress-tested transaction processing under peak loads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Example: Shopify</strong> <strong>making a dent in e-commerce!</strong></p>\n<p>Shopify experienced remarkable growth during the COVID-19 pandemic as more businesses moved to e-commerce. This was mainly due to fast yet strategic launch of offerings for businesses to sell online. In a span of a year, they grew revenue by <a href=\"https://growthnatives.com/blogs/ecommerce/tracking-shopifys-boom-in-ecommerce-business/\">over 80% and onboarded nearly 800k new businesses</a>! This growth was fueled by features like \"Shopify Payments,\" \"Shopify Capital,\" and \"Shopify Fulfillment Network\" to make it easier for businesses to manage online stores, process payments, and fulfill orders.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-yo634be.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nA key lesson to be learnt here that churning out offerings extremely quickly often means the product teams are taking up an iterative approach by breaking the complex bundle of features into several simpler parts and shipping them one after the other, whilst keeping a tab on user adoption. It’s a great tactic, one I tend to rely on a lot!</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"4investindifferentiatedbranding\">4. <strong>Invest in Differentiated Branding</strong></h3>\n<p>In crowded markets, your brand’s personality can make a lasting impression. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Visual identity</strong>: Is your design modern and appealing? For a fitness app, we chose vibrant, energetic colors and clean typography to appeal to younger audiences.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tone of voice</strong>: Are you approachable, authoritative, or innovative? Match your tone to your audience. For example, a financial planning tool might benefit from a reassuring and professional tone.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Share the story behind your product to build an emotional connection with users. For example, our marketing campaign for a productivity tool highlighted how it was inspired by the challenges of remote work during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> <strong>Nike and it’s inspirational running stories!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Differentiated Branding</strong>: Nike has built its brand around the theme of athletic empowerment and self-expression. The “Just Do It” slogan and endorsement of top athletes has made Nike synonymous with perseverance, excellence, and motivation.</li>\n<li><strong>Key Differentiators</strong>: Inspirational messaging, innovative athletic wear, and exclusive collaborations with celebrities and designers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-mk334tg.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"5leveragedatafordecisionmaking\">5. <strong>Leverage Data for Decision-Making</strong></h3>\n<p>Hyper-competitive markets require you to make quick, informed decisions. Set up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Data analytics tools</strong>: Track key metrics like acquisition, engagement, and retention. For instance, using tools like Mixpanel allowed us to understand feature usage patterns during beta testing.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Feedback loops</strong>: Regularly gather qualitative and quantitative insights from users. One product we launched had an in-app feedback button that yielded actionable insights within the first week.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Competitor benchmarking</strong>: Stay updated on what competitors are introducing and how users are reacting.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Build dashboards that give you real-time visibility into your product’s performance.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Example : Netflix and extreme AB testing</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nNetflix thrives in a hyper-competitive market by using data analytics tools to track key metrics like acquisition, engagement, and retention. By analyzing user behavior, including content preferences and consumption patterns, Netflix fine-tunes its recommendations engine and content investments. Tools such as <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/chapter_1/\">Mixpanel</a> enable detailed insights into feature usage during beta testing, optimizing decisions on what content to create or acquire.</p>\n<p>\\\nFunfact : Netflix use your personal data as <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/discovering-creative-insights-in-promotional-artwork-295e4d788db5\">insights to select cover art for the movie titles</a> you see on your TV. Their idea is, \"judge a movie by it’s cover”</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-bu434ht.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"6focusonretentionnotjustacquisition\">6. <strong>Focus on Retention, Not Just Acquisition</strong></h3>\n<p>Winning users is one thing; keeping them is another. To retain users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deliver exceptional customer experiences</strong>: Provide prompt support and proactive outreach. For example, offering 24/7 live chat support helped us maintain high retention rates for an e-commerce platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Evolve with user needs</strong>: Continuously gather feedback and adapt your product accordingly. A data visualization tool we launched added new chart types based on user requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Reward loyalty</strong>: Use incentives like referral programs or exclusive content for long-term users. A referral program offering extended premium subscriptions worked wonders for a fitness tracking app.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight:</strong> Loyal customers are your best advocates in competitive markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nExample: Zoom and how it thrives post-covid</p>\n<p>\\\nZoom knew that users would likely feel the need to drift back to G Meet, Teams, Webex etc and they really needed to continue adding value post-covid to retain all their gained customers. They really nailed it!</p>\n<p>\\\nZoom prioritized retention by offering exceptional customer support, including 24/7 live chat, ensuring users had a seamless experience. They also evolved based on user feedback, adding features like breakout rooms and virtual backgrounds to meet diverse needs. To reward loyalty, Zoom provided incentives such as extended trials for long-term users, ensuring they stayed engaged and became strong advocates in the competitive video conferencing market.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ul5343m.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"finalthoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Launching a product in a hyper-competitive market is no small feat, but it’s also an opportunity to shine. By understanding your audience, defining a strong UVP, moving quickly yet carefully, and investing in branding and retention, you can carve out your place even in the most crowded spaces.</p>\n<p>\\\nRemember, <strong><em>competition is not your enemy;</em></strong> <strong><em>it’s your motivator.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nUse it to sharpen your focus, improve your product, and deliver unparalleled value to your users. Good luck with your launch—and remember, the market is waiting for your unique touch! :)</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Who Even Needs Undersea Cables for Internet Anymore?","url":"https://hackernoon.com/who-even-needs-undersea-cables-for-internet-anymore?source=rss","date":1736782699,"author":"Edwin Liava'a","unread":true,"content":"<p>As we step into 2025, the Pacific region continues to grapple with the impacts of natural disasters, and recently, both Vanuatu and Tonga found themselves at the center of significant crises. In Vanuatu, a powerful earthquake struck the archipelago, causing widespread destruction and severing vital submarine fiber optic cable that had long been the lifeline for communication and connectivity. In Tonga, the country has experienced multiple internet outages related to its submarine cable infrastructure, with an 80% probability of such incidents recurring in the future.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn these critical moments, Starlink emerged as a beacon of hope, showcasing its remarkable capabilities in restoring connectivity and ultimately saving lives. Rather than relying solely on traditional infrastructure, which had been compromised, the people of Vanuatu and Tonga turned to Starlink's innovative satellite technology.</p>\n<p>\\\nWith a network of satellites orbiting the Earth, Starlink provided fast, reliable internet access that transcended the limitations of submarine cables. Imagine families separated by disaster, unable to communicate with loved ones or access essential services. With Starlink's deployment, individuals could connect to emergency services, share information, and reach out for help. In regions where every second counts, this connectivity was not just a convenience; it was a lifeline.</p>\n<p>\\\nStarlink's technology facilitated critical communication, allowing first responders to coordinate rescue efforts effectively and ensuring that medical facilities could operate without interruption. In Tonga, where repeated outages had left communities disconnected, Starlink offered a more resilient alternative, ensuring that people could stay connected even during the most challenging times.</p>\n<p>\\\nReflecting on these recent events, my perspective on connectivity infrastructure is shifting. While Starlink has demonstrated the immediate practical benefits of satellite-based internet, emerging technology like <a href=\"https://spacecoin.org/\">Spacecoin</a> is taking this concept even further by combining satellite connectivity with blockchain technology. This convergence of technologies suggests that not only do we not need traditional submarine cables, but we're on the cusp of a truly disruptive approach to internet infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe traditional internet infrastructure, dominated by submarine cables and controlled by a handful of major telecommunications companies, has created a centralized system vulnerable to both natural disasters and human intervention. While Starlink's satellite network offers one path to decentralization, Spacecoin's vision of a blockchain-powered satellite network represents the next evolution in this journey. By combining Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites with blockchain technology, Spacecoin aims to create a trustless, decentralized network that could further democratize internet access and ensure complete freedom from centralized control.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis shift towards decentralization through both satellite technology and blockchain could dramatically impact global accessibility and free speech, particularly in regions like the Pacific Islands. Starlink has already shown how satellite-based systems can maintain connectivity during infrastructure failures. Spacecoin's blockchain integration could take this further by ensuring that this connectivity isn't just resilient but also resistant to censorship and control through its decentralized governance structure.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe crux of the connectivity challenge in the Pacific Islands lies not only in the \"last mile\" problem but also in the network effect that has kept communities tethered to traditional infrastructure solutions. While Starlink's Direct to Cell capability offers one solution, Spacecoin's blockchain-based approach could provide additional benefits by enabling peer-to-peer connectivity and removing the need for traditional telecommunications intermediaries entirely.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn light of these challenges, Starlink's Direct to Cell capability presents an innovative solution for enhancing connectivity in the Pacific. This technology allows individuals to connect their mobile devices directly to satellites, eliminating the need for traditional ground-based infrastructure entirely. In areas where terrestrial networks are sparse or unreliable, Direct to Cell provides a lifeline, enabling seamless communication even in the most remote locations. As this capability expands, it reinforces the notion that satellite solutions can effectively meet the unique needs of small island communities, offering a reliable alternative that avoids the pitfalls of underutilized submarine systems.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the current internet landscape, algorithms controlled by major platforms significantly influence public perception and information flow. The combination of Starlink's satellite network and Spacecoin's blockchain technology could offer a powerful counter to this centralized control. While Starlink provides the physical infrastructure for decentralized access, Spacecoin's blockchain framework could ensure that the governance and operation of this infrastructure remain truly decentralized and community-driven.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile fully decentralized internet through satellite technology promises greater freedom from traditional forms of censorship, new challenges may emerge. The key will be ensuring that satellite providers themselves don't become new centralized authorities. This is where Spacecoin's blockchain governance model becomes particularly relevant, offering a transparent and democratic approach to network management that complements Starlink's physical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\\\nStarlink's satellites offer a more resilient and adaptable solution for small island nations. With the ability to roam and provide backhaul capabilities, Starlink can deliver high-speed internet to even the most remote locations, often at a fraction of the cost of traditional infrastructure. The earthquakes in Vanuatu and the recurring issues in Tonga have highlighted this shift, demonstrating that when disaster strikes, the ability to connect via satellite can be more effective than relying on undersea cables that can easily be severed.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs we embrace this new era of connectivity, we're seeing a convergence of solutions. Starlink has proven the viability of satellite-based internet in crisis situations, while Spacecoin's blockchain-powered approach promises to take this decentralization even further. For regions like Vanuatu and Tonga, this combination of technologies offers not just an alternative to traditional infrastructure, but a path toward a truly decentralized, resilient, and democratic internet.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe dawn of 2025 brings with it not just the promise of better connectivity, but of a fundamental transformation in how we think about internet infrastructure. As Starlink continues to demonstrate the practical benefits of satellite-based internet, and as Spacecoin develops its blockchain-powered satellite network, we're moving toward a future where the question isn't whether we can survive without submarine cables, but how quickly we can embrace these new decentralized technologies that promise to revolutionize global connectivity.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Nvidia Snaps Back at Biden's 'Innovation-Killing' AI Chip Export Restrictions","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/1527220/nvidia-snaps-back-at-bidens-innovation-killing-ai-chip-export-restrictions?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1736782020,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"content":"Nvidia has hit back at the outgoing Biden administration's AI chip tech export restrictions designed to tighten America's stranglehold on supply chains and maintain market dominance.

Context and Participant Characterization</h2>\n<p>We decided to conduct our focus group with experienced developers of the VazaZika development team [111, 112]. The VazaZika is a gamified software that encourages policies of education in public health concerning the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya. VazaZika aims to address the need for constantly reporting mosquito breeding sites. By using 12 game design elements (avatar, badge, challenge, comment, level, notification, point, ranking, social activity, social sharing, team and vote) and 16 game rules that reward citizens by reporting mosquito breeding sites the software successfully promote the collaborative work of citizens towards disease prevention, a fruitful competition among citizens, at the same time that improving the quality of reported mosquito breeding sites [111, 112].</p>\n<p>\\\nThe VazaZika software resulted from an international research project entitled Leveraging GamiFIcation and Social Networks for Improving Prevention and Control of Zika [111, 112]. This project was performed by researchers in Software Engineering and Data Analytics from Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK). A total of 25 members participated in the project: one project manager; four development team leaders; 15 software developers, including the team leaders, distributed in two Brazilian cities, each with at least one developer per team; and seven senior researchers, five from Brazil and two from the UK. The project counted on the active contribution of a dozen Brazilian public health agents, which assisted many development activities.</p>\n<p>\\\nFrom 15 software developers of the VazaZika development team, we successfully recruited four developers, including two team leaders. Table 16 provides a general view on the participants background. We have collected the table data from an online Participant Characterization Form, which we sent to participants minutes before the start of the focus group session. The team leaders are marked in Table 16 with the symbol (*).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-4e93vp9.png\" alt=\"Table 16: Participant Background Collected via Characterization Form\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nBy observing Table 16, we can see that all participants have a high education level, all of them having a PhD in Computer Science. Also, all participants have at least ten years of experience with software development and have been involved with at least six software projects. Finally, two participants reported a high level of knowledge in gamification and game design elements (P1 and P2), and two others reported a very low (P3) and low (P4) level of knowledge. Thus, we assume that we have a balanced set of participants in terms of expertise on the specific topic. It is noteworthy that all of them actively participated as developers (or technical team lead - in the case of P1 and P2) in the gamification of the VazaZika software.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08346\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Evaluating the Usefulness of Negative Effects in GDE Adoption","url":"https://hackernoon.com/evaluating-the-usefulness-of-negative-effects-in-gde-adoption?source=rss","date":1736773210,"author":"Gamifications FTW Publications","unread":true,"content":"<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Clauvin Almeida, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;</p>\n<p>(2) Marcos Kalinowski, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;</p>\n<p>(3) Anderson Uchoa, Federal University of Ceara (UFC), Itapaje, Brazil;</p>\n<p>(4) Bruno Feijo, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/HAYN9tLCaZA9ehGtSe6p\">Abstract and 1 Introduction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/9hT34x7oDVE4jJgkkvsc\">2.

On the Perceived Usefulness, Ease of use and Intent of Adoption of Mapped Negative Effects</h2>\n<p>As designed, based on a simplified and direct approach on the main TAM constructs, we asked participants to assign one vote to their agreement degree on the usefulness, ease of use, and intent of adoption of information on potential negative effects of game design elements to support adoption decisions. We have collected the agreement degree by the participants in the session’s virtual mural (as illustrated in section G of Figure 7) based on a five-point Likert scale [114].</p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 16 illustrates the level of Agreement reported by the participants.</p>\n<p>\\\nAll participants strongly agree about the usefulness of the potential negative effects of game design elements to support adoption decisions. On the other hand, only one participant partially disagrees and three participants partially agree that the information about the potential negative effects are easy to use. Finally, one participant partially agrees and three participants strongly agree on the intent to use. With regard to these questions, participant P1 mentioned that information about the negative effects are sensitive to the context of the gamified software: <em>“[…] depending on the context of your software, it may be that all negatives effects become positives, for instance.

The Developers’ Perception on The Negative Effects</h2>\n<p>We asked participants to assign one vote to the awareness degree on the negative effects reported in the literature and to provide us with comments on pros and cons for using the game design elements under discussion. We have collected these comments through post-it notes added by the participants in the session’s virtual mural (as illustrated in Figure 8). In order to analyze these comments, we first watched the video and audio records and transcribed them into plain text. Thereafter, we analyzed all post-it comments written by the participants and associated transcription quotes. In the following subsections, we summarize the comments that emerged for each group of game design elements.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>5.3.1. Badges and Rewards</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 9 illustrates the comments made by the participants. In this group of game design elements, three participants reported being mostly unaware, and only one participant reported being mostly aware about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative ones.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Positive comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of two positive comments. <strong>Increases Extrinsic Motivation</strong>. Participant P1 mentioned that he was unaware about the negative effect of reducing intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, the participants mentioned that the use of these game design elements, in isolation or together with others, is important to increase extrinsic motivation. As mentioned by P1 and agreed by P3, as follows.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “when we see that a player has many badges, what we expect as developers is that another player becomes more motivated, […] the perception is that it increases the extrinsic motivation. However, I was unaware that [the use of badges and rewards] could reduce intrinsic motivation.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-4u83v5o.png\" alt=\"Figure 9: Positive and Negative Comments for Badges and Rewards.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “We made some simulations using badges as part of the challenges, I would say that yes, it had a return on the motivation.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Distinguished Badges to improve engagement quality.</strong> Another positive point highlighted by the participants was the use of distinguished badges to improve engagement quality. In this sense, participant P3 mentioned that one of the strategies used to motivate users of the VazaZika software was the use of distinguished badges, which could only be won by the user under specific conditions, associated with challenges and time intervals.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “[…] the idea of distinguished badges instead of [normal] badges that you can get doing a task anytime, [is that] you have distinguished badges associated with a certain time period, a certain challenge. So the idea would be to motivate certain periods associated with each badge.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of four negative comments. <strong>Super motivation.</strong> An interesting negative point raised by participants P2 and P3 concerns the super motivation of users in performing tasks, aimed only at winning badges and rewards. In this case, P3 also mentioned that super motivating users can lead to the introduction of false data into the software. For instance, in gamified software where the user earns badges for each check-in performed.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “[…] In the VazaZika software, we had a badge that the user would only earn if he was in a certain location in a specific period of time […]. So it was possible to increase the [data] quality, because we knew that the user who was completing this challenge was reporting real mosquito breeding sites.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough the presence of super motivated users has a negative effect, participant P2 also mentioned that this effect can be minimized through the definition of validation mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “[..] in programming sites in which the user is super motivated, writing code and sending a lot of code every time. The control mechanism is good [because] it tests and verifies that the code is working. Thus, the super motivated user is not a problem in this case. It would only be a problem if the control mechanism was bad.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Validation mechanisms to avoid cheating.</strong> Another negative point mentioned by the participants was the need to introduce validation mechanisms to avoid cheating. As mentioned by participants P1 and P4.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “In order to avoid false data, we used the vote (up and downvote) to verify and validate if that reported mosquito breeding site was really real or not.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “[…] we had a worry that the award by itself, without any type of control mechanism, could be harmful. In our context, at the health area, that involved the work of health public agent, government actions […], a greater care was needed to ensure the fidelity of information.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Cheating to Badges.</strong> Another point mentioned, and strongly related to super motivation, and the presence of validation mechanisms is the practice of cheating to badges, intending to earn more rewards as mentioned by the participant P2 as follows.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “[…] the player was misrepresenting the app data because he was super motivated to win the badge. However, I do not think that this avoids the bigger problem that is the false data that are entering the software, this is the big context.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Excessive focus on rewards.</strong> Finally, the participants mentioned that the use of badges and rewards can generate an excessive focus on earning rewards. According to participant P4, this may be due to the gamification software being designed to generate rewards for users after performing simple and repetitive tasks, generating a deficiency in the game’s logic.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “So, maybe it is related to certain gamified software that have more focus in provide rewards than the game logic.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “[So], if the idea is to [provide] fun, entertain and attract [the players], we need to be more careful in giving rewards for each performed task by the player. This cannot go unnoticed. We need game logic too.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>5.3.2. Competitions, Challenges and Goals</em></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 10 illustrates the pros and cons mentioned by the participants for Competitions, Challenges and Goals. In this group of game design elements, two participants reported a mostly unaware, and two participants reported mostly awareness about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Positive comments.</strong> The participants mentioned a total of three positive comments as follows. <strong>Communitary (social) integration</strong>. P4 mentioned that the use of competition, challenges, and goals can increase community integration. More particularity, the participant mentioned the use of these game design elements in a particular community, for instance, the citizens of a particular neighborhood can increase integration between those involved. As we can see below.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ap93v9d.png\" alt=\"Figure 10: Positive and Negative Comments for Competitions, Challenges, and Goals.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “The context here influences a lot. I would add this type of competition as an advantage. So, if you are gamifying something that probably has a purpose of getting a result for a certain community, e.g., a industry, but specifically in our case citizens within a neighborhood or region, I see this as an opportunity for integration.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Cooperative tasks can help integrate the community.</strong> In line with the previous positive reason, participant P2 mentioned that the use of cooperative competitions, i.e., in which players come together to achieve the same goal, is more motivating than just creating competitions between players.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “if you create competitions that aren’t necessarily between players, but between players around a common goal, you can help players come together to achieve those goals. In VazaZika, we’ve done that by enabling team creation.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Team effort might reduce individual efforts.</strong> Complementary, Participant P3 mentioned that depending on the type of challenge and its difficulty level, is essential that the challenge be done with two to three people. In this sense, the creation of cooperative tasks helps to reduce the effort to achieve a common goal.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “What I think goes against the extra effort, is that depending on the challenge, you can not do it alone, you need two to three people”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of five negative comments, as follows. <strong>Perceived extra effort.</strong> Participant P1 has mentioned that extra effort is a negative effect when challenges require physical effort. In the context of the VazaZika software, citizens had to report and validate real cases of mosquito outbreaks in loco. The participant also mentioned that even though the challenge is done in teams, the extra effort was still perceived by the citizens.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “Most of our challenges required a physical effort since the citizens had to go to a location to report or validate the existence of a mosquito breeding site, either individually or in teams. We were aware that there was an extra effort because they would have to move around.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Can demotivate casual players.</strong> Another interesting negative reason mentioned by participant P2 concerns the demotivation of casual players to participate in competitions that attract frenetic or experienced players. In other words, a casual player may feel demotivated to compete with frenetic players, whose experience level is constantly increasing due to the time spent these players in performing gamified activities in the software.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “You have a frenetic community of [players] who set the bar high, and for a [casual player] to participate in competitions is simply demotivating, because he cannot play casually in these competitions.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Rules might demotivate participation.</strong> Another problem associated with the demotivation of casual players is related to the definition of rules that can restrict the participation of some players in collaborative challenges. For instance, rules that involve the availability of collaborative challenges in a given time interval may restrict the participation of players who are in different time-zones. As mentioned by Participant P3 as follows.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “Another problem is that there are some rules in competitions that make it difficult for players to participate, e.g., players who are in a completely different time zone and who want to compete with their friends from Brazil who are in another time zone. In this sense, a rule involving time restrictions discourages a player from participating in the competition.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\nOn the other hand, participant P4 mentioned that the definition of rules that restrict the participation of players is not always a bad design. That is the case of challenges that involve the participation of a community (a favela), or a small group of adolescents in a public school. Such challenges, although they have geographic restrictions, also stimulate the accomplishment of tasks or challenges pertinent to a certain location. For instance, a challenge to report mosquito outbreaks in a region with a public health policy deficiency.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “For a community geographically, a favela, adolescents from a public school […] it would be a stimulus, to prevent diseases […]”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Rules may stop competitors to participate in the way they want.</strong> In line with the previous comment, participant P3 mentioned that some rules in addition to demotivating can stop players that want to participate in challenges. For instance, rules related to the minimum quality of participants for challenges. In this case, the software may be forcing challenges with certain characteristics that a player does not necessarily want as mentioned by participant P3 as follows.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “I remember that in the VazaZika software , some competitions could only be held by a team, and the team had a minimum amount of people. […] So, the software was forcing you to enter a competition with certain characteristics that you don’t necessarily want.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Confusion to reach the goal as a team.</strong> In fact the lack of understanding can be a negative effect. More specifically, participant P1 mentioned that although instructions for completing a challenge were explicitly provided to players, in some cases they could not understand what needed to be done to complete a challenge as a team.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “The lack of understanding could indeed have this negative effect. We tried to make it explicit what they had to do to complete a challenge, but they still couldn’t understand.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>5.3.3. Leaderboards and Rankings</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 11 illustrates the pros and cons mentioned by the participants for Leaderboards and Rankings. Similar to the previous group of game design elements, two participants reported a mostly unaware, and two participants reported mostly awareness about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Positive comments.</strong> The only positive comment mentioned was <strong>Can create pro players</strong>, by P2, where he argued that players with a higher level of ability in the game would be able to be beneficial outside it.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “Per example, trying to get the context of a gamified system, the HackerRank, (…) that is a programming questions’ system, the pro players there… for you to be as good as them, you have to ’waste your life’ writing code and submitting questions all the time, and being approved on the tests and gaining points.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “But the pro players in those systems are so good in algorithms that they would easily be approved on certain business interviews, you understand? So, there’s a lot of business monitoring those pro players, let’s say that. So for the industry that is monitoring the rankings, this could be a positive point. Not considering all the negative effect of the thing that can stress you, stuff like that. For the corporate world this can help somehow.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-sma3vkk.png\" alt=\"Figure 11: Positive and Negative Comments for Leaderboards and Rankings.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comments.</em> There are four negative comment, starting with <strong>Depends on the profile of the players (collaborative or competitive),</strong> the participant P3 mentioned that depending on the type of player, the use of leaderboards or rankings can have a negative effect. For instance, unlike players with a competitive profile, who are motivated to get the best positions, collaborative players can feel unmotivated.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “[…] there are those that will consider Leaderboards and Rankings as something that motivates them, ”I want to be the first”, but there are others with a more collaborative profile, their reaction will be ”look, I don’t want to participate and be the first”, so it depends a lot of the […] players’ profile.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Cooperative harassment.</strong> Participant P4 has mentioned that the use of leaderboards and rankings in a cooperative environment, mainly in the private sector, can lead to harassment or bullying of the player. In this case, participant P4 argued that in these environments, a player can use leaderboards and rankings as a form of harassment, both for those who are at the top of leaderboards/rankings and for those who are not.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “[…] in the public sector and mixed economy, this worry with harassment, the person feeling excluded, diminished, or even demotivated. And that has a lot to do with the negative effect.[…] They see that as a way to reduce the other, both who is higher in the rankings/leaderboards and who is lower.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Limits of quantitative approaches (do not consider particular situations).</strong> In line with the Cooperative harassment, participant P4 mentioned that a negative aspect is the use of leaderboards and rankings heavily based on quantitative approaches. P4 argued that in situations in which a player is unable to perform tasks in the software, he will lose positions in the ranking, which would be considered unfair. For instance, in cooperative environments when a player takes sick leave, his actions are no longer quantified.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “[…]exceptions will always happen because we are human and there will be situations where the person will fall through the rankings and that will be considered unfair, as an example, a medic license and the person went away. And the metrics are […] quantitative, and the rankings are mostly quantitative.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Can create an unfair competition</strong>. Is related to the demotivation of beginner players in achieving leadership or a similar position to players who are at the top of the leaderboard. In other words, depending on the beginner player’s current level, he may never reach the leadership as mentioned by participant P1 as follows.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “So I think this is a cons point, because depending on what level you are, you will never reach the lead.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>5.3.4. Points, XPs and Virtual Currencies</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 12 illustrates the comments made by the participants for Points, XPs, and Virtual Currencies. About the awareness degree, three participants reported a mostly unaware, and one participant reported mostly awareness about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-fwb3ved.png\" alt=\"Figure 12: Positive and Negative Comments for Points, XPs and Virtual Currencies.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Positive comments.</em> Two positive comments were made by participant P3: <strong>Build a reputation mechanism</strong> and <strong>It increases reliability</strong>. Participant P3 exemplified that in systems such as Stack Overflow, a gamified system of questions and answers about programming problems, the use of points helps to build a reputation in terms of the player’s level of experience in response to specific answers. At the same time, responses from highly reputable players are considered highly reliable.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “For instance, let’s think about the case of Stack Overflow, that is a gamified system where sometimes you want to search an answer to a solution, then you have two possibilities, which one you choose first? The one of the user with the highest XP. […].”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comment.</em> The participants P2 and P4 mentioned that <strong>There are games that allow paying to win, demotivating others</strong> as a negative reason. In this sense, P2 discussed the negative effects of virtual currencies in allowing players to obtain advantages over other players (pay to win).</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “It’s a real option. And then you have games with a mechanic of paying to have advantages upon other players. This creates a demotivation. It’s what people calls as pay to win.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\nParticipant P4 also argued that the use of virtual currencies, which facilitates the practice of pay to win, can discourage players who continually perform actions in the software in order to advance in the game.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “I agree a lot with P2. I can’t see the gamification context, it does not occur to me that it would be worthy to give coin or the opportunity to pay to play, I can’t see it, because usually the serious game, you will gamify a thing there to fix an issue, how are you going to add payment there? Why when you pay to achieve something without a fight for that, so that is done only to brag about the achievement. But in a serious game you have to do things, you have to solve problems. So, how can you in this context use a coin, not only as money but being able to pay to gain the money? Then in this pay to win, I agree completely with P2, and I can’t see, can’t glimpse in the serious game context that you would pay to win.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>5.3.5. Feedback and Achievements</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 13 illustrates the comments made by the participants for Feedback and Achievements. In this group of game design elements, two participants were completely unaware, one participant was mostly unaware, and one participant as mostly aware of the negative effects. We detail each reason as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Positive comments.</em> <strong>Public feedbacks may serve as hints for other users</strong> and <strong>Achievements-driven players can play and contribute more.</strong> P1 added that public feedbacks would be advantageous to engage the users. In other words, users can feel motivated, realizing that other users are performing tasks and being rewarded for them.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-i6c3veo.png\" alt=\"Figure 13: Positive and Negative Comments for Feedback and Achievements.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “So, there’s that question about various gamification elements, but in truth, it has the same meaning. I think, this was our case, in relation to the list of activities that the citizen would be able to do, I don’t know if you all agree, but when we say to the other citizens that that player, that citizen, did an activity with success, I believe that it is a valid feedback form to other participants, even as a way to engage. So-and-so is reporting small flies at that region. Hey I’m also going there because theoretically there’s a high concentration, or something like that.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Difficult to perceive feedback as negative.</strong> Participant P3 mentioned that the use of feedback should be considered in any software. In gamified software , its use is more intensive because when the user performing a task with with reward, the user must always be informed.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “[…] Feedback is something that must be considered in any software development. […]. So, as a gamified software this should be even more prominent, because, you start doing a lot of different achievements and you don’t get any response from the software that you’re changing levels and getting a badge. So it’s a little difficult for me to see that lack of effect is a negative feedback effect.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comments.</em> <strong>Excessive feedback might be a problem</strong> and <strong>Massive use of feedback.</strong> The Participant P3 have mentioned that the excessive use of feedback results in a negative and intrusive effect for the user of the software .</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “Maybe it can be bad when you receive too much feedback. For instance, I logged into the software , and I get a notification, anything you do on the software gets feedback. So maybe there is a negative and intrusive effect.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>5.3.6. Avatar</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 14 illustrates the comments made by the participants for Avatars. Three participants were completely unaware, and only one participant was completely aware about the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-otd3vcr.png\" alt=\"Figure 14: Positive and Negative Comments for Avatars.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Positive comments.</strong> The participants have mentioned a total of four positive and one negative comments as follows. <strong>Basic characteristics of any game, enables customizing the users.</strong> P1 and P3 have mentioned Avatar is a basic characteristic of any gamified software . Even more so today, in which everyone wants to differentiate themselves, and in this case an avatar can express that difference.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “In the same way that XP is considered a basic feature of any game, Avatar is too. Even more so nowadays, when everyone wants to differentiate themselves, and you don’t have an avatar that can express that difference. For me or at least for most users it is a core feature of the software.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\nAdditionally, participant P1 mentioned that from the end user’s point of view, there is no extra effort in selecting an avatar’s characteristics. P1 also mentioned that setting up an avatar is normally part of the initial setup of any game.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “From the end user’s point of view, I don’t think it takes too much effort. Also, as P3 mentioned, if you were going to play some other game, or even some gamified software, a step in the tutorial is to create your avatar.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Self-expression brings engagement.</strong> The participant P4 have mentioned that in gamified software s that focus on a younger audience, the use of avatars leads to greater engagement, mainly due to the capacity for self-expression.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “You know, it’s a thing that it must exist, because some like it, mainly the young public.[…]”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Development effort might pay off (e.g., engag</strong>ement). Participant P2 has mentioned that despite the development effort required to add an avatar as a feature into the software, the effort might pay off, especially if the avatar increases user engagement in the software.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P2: “Understood. Because, even if it demands effort from the developer to create the activity, if me manages to engage (…), even if just 10% or 20% of the users, it would be worthwhile.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comment.</em> The participants P1 and P4 mentioned that an <strong>Extra effort was indeed considered in the gamified software, and only basic avatars were used.</strong> More specifically, P1, mentioned that the creation of sophisticated avatars requires the customization of different items, e.g., hair, clothes, skin color, which consumes development time (one of the main constraints of the VazaZika project).</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “From the developer’s point of view, in VazaZika we didn’t have a sophisticated avatar where you could choose your hair, clothes, skin color, etc. One of the comments for this was extra effort, and time restrictions.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\nParticipant P4 also mentioned that the extra effort is also related to the constant need to make new items available for the avatar, which are often driven by external trends, associated with the need for a professional with design skills.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “Who chooses and customizes an Avatar is an identity mechanism, the person will continually update the Avatar. Something happened, I’ll update the avatar. Changed a trend, a fashion, I’ll update. It’s how I change clothes. I update the avatar all the time.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P4: “(…)because it’s something that demands much more design, so it must have a designer, someone that would work with that part.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>5.3.7. Quizzes</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 15 illustrates the comments made by the participants. Two participants were mostly unaware, and two mostly aware of the negative effects. We detail each comment as follows grouped by positive and negative comments.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Positive comment.</em> The participants mentioned one positive comment: <strong>Might Help To Achieve Educational Purposes Participant</strong> P1 mentioned that, although quizzes were not added to VazaZika software, the quizzes were considered in the early phases of VazaZika software design. The same participant also mentioned that an advantage of using quizzes is enabling achieving educational purposes.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-kte3vow.png\" alt=\"Figure 15: Positive and Negative Comments for Quizzes.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “I think that the advantage is when you want to gamify in this educational sense. So, in our software the advantage would be that we would be making the citizen be more conscious about the peculiarities of the small fly and its focus. So, how to combat the focus? Which is the time period with more incidence? […]”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Negative comments.</em> The participants mentioned a total of three negative comments as follows. Boring task. P1 mentioned that compared to other gamified tasks, answering questions can demotivate players.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P1: “[…] only answering questions really is a bit boring, if compared with other tasks that the game would offer.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Frustration after getting wrong answers.</strong> In line with P1, participant P3 elaborated on the possible negative effect of using quizzes is the frustration when a user gives a wrong answer to a question, generating pressure to get it right.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “First that I don’t like quizzes, but there are cases where you have to do, right, you don’t have a choice. But there’s that pressure of having to get it right, and when you don’t, you stay with that […] frustration, and I always see it as a negative effect.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “Even more when you are in an educational software, where the person answering the quiz wants to get it right and when it doesn’t, or has the pressure to, or gets frustrated.[…]”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Risk of repetition.</strong> The use of traditional quizzes may have the risk of repetition, resulting in the lack of motivation of the players as pointed by P3 as follows.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>P3: “The repetition risk that I added here, its obvious that there are a lot of mechanisms to avoid [it], but a more conventional quiz where you raffle questions in a small group always have that.”</em></p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08346\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"AI Mistakes Are Very Different Than Human Mistakes","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-mistakes-schneier","date":1736773203,"author":"Bruce Schneier","unread":true,"content":"<p>We need new security systems designed to deal with their weirdness</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTQ3OTA1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODE2Njk0Nn0.VmGGcZjk8qvggdKGxvh-LqePGPict_eO22aBTM2xQFA/image.jpg?width=600","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Float Financial, which aims to be the Brex of Canada, lands US$48.5M Series B","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/float-financial-which-aims-to-be-the-brex-of-canada-lands-us48-5m-series-b/","date":1736773200,"author":"Mary Ann Azevedo","unread":true,"content":"<p>Float Financial, an expense management and corporate card startup focused on the Canadian market, has raised $48.5 million in a Series B funding round.

We're reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt.\" \n\nBut soon Blue Origin will again attempt its very first orbital flight. And they'll also attempt to land their reusable Stage 1 on a drone in the Atlantic ocean... \n\nSeveral hours Sunday night their rocket was fueled on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, awaiting ignition. Its three-hour launch window had just opened. And Blue Origin was webcasting it all live on their web page... \n\nBut whatever happened, Ars Technica's senior space editor Eric Berger got to talk to an \"affable and anxious\" Jeff Bezos:\n\n\n\"It's pretty exciting, isn't it?\" Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, said by way of greeting... I asked what his expectations were for the launch of New Glenn, which has a three-hour window that opens at 1 am ET (06:00 UTC) on Monday, January 13... \"We would certainly like to achieve orbit, and get the Blue Ring Pathfinder into orbit,\" Bezos said. \"Landing the booster would be gravy on top of that. It's kind of insane to try and land the booster. A more sane approach would probably be to try to land it into ocean. But we're gonna go for it.\" \n\nBlue Origin has built a considerable amount of infrastructure on a drone ship, Jacklyn, that will be waiting offshore for the rocket to land upon. Was Bezos not concerned about putting that hardware at risk? \"I'm worried about everything,\" he admitted. However, the rocket has been programmed to divert from the ship if the avionics on board the vehicle sense that anything is off-nominal. And there is, of course, a pretty good chance of that happening. \"We've done a lot of work, we've done a lot of testing, but there are some things that can only be tested in flight,\" Bezos said. \"And you can't be overconfident in these things... The reality is, there are a lot of things that go wrong, and you have to accept that, if something goes wrong, we'll pick ourselves up and get busy for the second flight.\" \n\nBezos also pointed out that 7% of all the people who have ever flown into space have done so on a Blue Origin vehicle &mdash; including himself, an experience he told Ars Technica \"is kind of hard to beat... That really was very meaningful for a whole bunch of reasons. \n\n\"But this is, you know, the culmination of a lot of hard work by a lot of people. And it's a really big deal. You know, you don't get very many first flights, yeah, and here we go.\" \n\nThe rocket's payload nose cone (or fairing) has the signatures of thousands of Blue Origin employees, according to a Blue Origin post on Instagram, calling it \"a tribute to the hard work and passion for mission we all have here...\" More details about the launch:\n\n Space.com notes that the launch \"was initially scheduled for Jan. 10 and then Jan. 12, but Blue Origin postponed it due to rough offshore weather that could affect a rocket landing on the company's recovery ship in the Atlantic.\" Space Force officials forecast the chance of good liftoff conditions Sunday night were 50%.\n\n\"We want to be clear about our objectives,\" Blue Origin posted Sunday on X.com. \"This is our first flight and we've prepared rigorously for it. But no amount of ground testing or mission simulations is a replacement for flying this rocket. Our key objective today is to reach orbit safely. Anything beyond that is icing on the cake. We know landing the booster on our first try offshore in the Atlantic is ambitious &mdash; but we're going for it. No matter what happens, we'll learn, refine, and apply that knowledge to our next launch.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhile Blue Origin's \"New Shephard\" capsule can hold up to six passengers, the New Glenn's capsule has 30 times that capacity.\n\nSpace.com notes the rocket is carrying a payload: a test version of the company's new 'Blue Ring' spacecraft platform to validate its orbit-to-ground communications capabilities.\n\nTo get the next generation excited about space travel, Blue Origin's web site is selling an 11.5-inch , 636-piece model of the New Glenn rocket (complete with a retractable launch tower).<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Blue+Origin+Livestreams+-+But+Postpones+-+Its+First+Orbital+Rocket+Launch%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F0627230%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F13%2F0627230%2Fblue-origin-livestreams---but-postpones---its-first-orbital-rocket-launch%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0627230/blue-origin-livestreams---but-postpones---its-first-orbital-rocket-launch?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23577649&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Linux 6.13-rc7 Released: Linux 6.13 Stable Likely Next Week","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.13-rc7-Released","date":1736724240,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"content":"Linux 6.13-rc7 is out as the newest weekly release candidate for Linux 6.13 is a more exciting one than weeks prior with many of the developers and kernel testers returning from the end-of-year holiday break.
