Shortly thereafter, tech-backed nonprofit Code.org emerged (led by Smith's next-door neighbor Hadi Partovi with Smith as a founding Board member) with a mission to ensure that U.S. schoolchildren started receiving 'rigorous' computer science education instruction. Around the same time, Mark Zuckerberg's FWD.us PAC launched (with support from Smith, Partovi, and other tech leaders) with a mission to reform tech visa policy to meet tech's need for talent. \n\nFast forward to 2024, and Newsweek reports the debate over tech immigration policy has been revived, spurred by the recent appointment of Sriram Krishnan as senior policy adviser for AI at the Trump White House. Comments by far-right political activist Laura Loomer on Twitter about Krishnan's call for loosening Green Card restrictions were met with rebuttals from prominent tech leaders who are also serving as members of the Trump transition team. Entrepreneur David Sacks, who Trump has tapped as his cryptocurrency and AI czar, took to social media to clarify that Krishnan advocates for removing country caps on green cards, not eliminating caps entirely, aiming to create a more merit-based system. However, the NY Times reported that Sacks discussed a much broader visa reform proposal with Trump during a June podcast (\"What I will do is,\" Trump told Sacks, \"you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country\"). Elon Musk, the recently appointed co-head of Trump's new Dept. of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had Sacks' and Krishnan's backs (not unexpected -- both were close Musk advisors on his Twitter purchase), tweeting out \"Makes sense\" to his 209 million followers, lamenting that \"the number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,\" reposting claims crediting immigrants for 36% of the innovation in the U.S., and taking USCIS to task for failing to immediately recognize his own genius with an Exceptional Ability Green Card (for his long-defunct Zip2 startup). \n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who Trump has tapped to co-lead DOGE with Musk, agreed and fanned the Twitter flames with a pinned Tweet of his own explaining, \"The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born -- first-generation engineers over \"native\" Americans isn't because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy -- wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture.\" (Colorado Governor Jared Polis also took to Twitter to agree with Musk and Ramaswamy on the need to import 'elite engineers'). And Code.org CEO Partovi joined the Twitter fray, echoing the old we-need-H1B-visas-to-make-US-schoolchildren-CS-savvy argument of Microsoft's 2012 National Talent Strategy. \"Did you know 2/3 of H1B visas are for computer scientists?\" Partovi wrote in reply to Musk, Loomer, and Sachs. \"The H1B program raises $500M/year (from its corporate sponsors) and all that money is funneled into programs at Labor and NSF without focus to grow local CS talent. Let's fund CS education.\" The NYT also cited Zuckerberg's earlier efforts to influence immigration policy with FWD.us (which also counted Sacks and Musk as early supporters), taking note of Zuck's recent visit to Mar-a-Lago and Meta's $1 million donation to Trump's upcoming inauguration. \n\nSo, who is to be believed? Musk, who attributes any tech visa qualms to \"a 'fixed pie' fallacy that is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking\" and argues that \"there is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation ['We should let anyone in the country who is hardworking and honest and will be a contributor to the United States,' Musk has said]\"? Or economists who have found that immigration and globalization is not quite the rising-tide-that-raises-all-boats it's been cracked up to be?<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Trump+Transition+Leaders+Call+For+Eased+Tech+Immigration+Policy%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F27%2F0127229%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F27%2F0127229%2Ftrump-transition-leaders-call-for-eased-tech-immigration-policy%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/27/0127229/trump-transition-leaders-call-for-eased-tech-immigration-policy?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23562185&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"AI sales rep startups are booming.

They price the options using an Automatic Market Maker (AMM). Lyra [10] stands as the preeminent decentralized options trading platform, commanding around a third of the marketâs TVL, and employs an AMM with a Black76 [4] pricing model. However, its operations hinge on external data feeds from oracle, such as spot prices and implied volatility. Hegic [44] decentralizes the writersâ risk and employs a fixed pricing rate based on option expiry date and target prices, which leads to less accurate pricing.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn traditional markets, the price of options is determined by supply and demand. Devising an effective pricing model for options by AMM faces challenges due to the lack of accurate supply and demand modeling. Therefore, an order-book based decentralized exchange shows up. Aevo [2] is a high-performance, order-book based decentralized exchange, which closely resembles the traditional options market. However, its current implementation employs an off-chain orderbook coupled with on-chain settlement, which introduces a higher degree of centralized risk into the protocol. Opyn [30] provides users with the ability to sell European options by minting ERC20 tokens as the option. These tokens can be destroyed to exercise rights or transacted in the market. However, the system faces challenges due to high gas fees on Ethereum and a lack of necessary liquidity for exchanges. All of above on-chain protocols lack universality, most [2, 10, 30, 44] currently only support ETH and BTC options trading and lack the flexibility of customized pricing to meet the needs of the traders</p>\n<p>\\\nA Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) can address the aforementioned issues by enabling two parties to create option contracts across two chains. These contracts lock assets, agreed upon by both parties, on two chains at a predetermined price. HTLCs [23, 29, 48] were originally designed for cross-chain atomic swaps. Subsequently, Han et al. [14] highlighted the optionality and fairness aspects for one party, demonstrating that an atomic crosschain swap is equivalent to a premium-free American call option. They estimate premiums with Cox-Ross-Rubinstein option pricing model [8]. They addresses the unfairness by incorporating a premium mechanism. In [47], the authors define a sore loser attack in cross-chain swaps and let participants escrow assets along with a negotiated option premium, which acts as compensation. Nadahalli et al. [26] separate the premium protocol from the collateral protocol, employs upfront communication of off-chain unspent transaction outputs as the option premium and collateral. [21, 42] introduce cross-chain atomic options, incorporating concepts such as the holderâs late margin deposit and early cancellation of the option. In [12], the authors introduce transferability of options. However, their approach requires long transfer times and does not support concurrent trading involving multiple buyers, which may lead to phantom bid attacks. An adversary can create multiple fake buyers who offer higher prices but fail to complete the transfer. Consequently, the option holder is unable to sell their position</p>\n<p>\\\nNone of these protocols eliminate the holderâs collateral in crosschain options. To eliminate the holderâs upfront collateral requirement, cross-chain transaction confirmation can be adopted to verify the collateral deposition on one chain when the option is exercised. This approach can employ cross-chain bridges. Some cross-chain bridges rely on external verification and introduces a trusted third party to facilitate message transmission. This approach is vulnerable to many attacks [40, 50], such as rug pulls [18], code vulnerabilities [28] and private key leakage [24]. Some bridges employ native verification and use light clients on both chains to verify proofs. This method requires complex smart contracts and incurs high verification and storage costs [9, 39, 46, 49]. The diversity and heterogeneity of blockchains significantly increase the time and cost of implementing a light client for each chain. An alternative is using Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for cross-chain transactions [3, 41]. Those solutions are susceptible to both software and hardware vulnerabilities, including side-channel attacks, which present significant security risks [7, 20, 25, 36, 43].</p>\n<p>\\\nOur proposed approach provides an efficient cross-chain option protocol by combining HTLC logic with a signature scheme. This combination facilitates the transfer of positions and replacement of hashlocks in option contracts. Our approach eliminates the need for option holders to provide upfront collateral. Instead of relying on cross-chain bridges, we achieve this through a distributed protocol design bolstered by economic incentives.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zifan Peng, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (zpengao@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(2) Yingjie Xue, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (yingjiexue@hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(3) Jingyu Liu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (jliu514@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Watch this robotic âSuperman Suitâ rotate around a gymnastics bar","url":"https://techcrunch.com/video/watch-this-robotic-superman-suit-rotate-around-a-gymnastics-bar/","date":1735250053,"author":"TC Video","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Scientists at the Suzumori Endo Robotics lab in Tokyo have developed the Superman Suit: a suit powered by hydraulic artificial muscles that allow it to perform superhuman tasks.

We implemented, tested, and evaluated our proposed protocol, Efficient Cross-Chain Options without Upfront Holder Collateral, in Section 4.2.1. This was conducted within a simulated environment using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) (Remix VM Cancun) and the Solidity Compiler version 0.8.22. We employ the same signature algorithm as Ethereum, utilizing the secp256k1 curve and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) [17]. Since EVM does not support direct on-chain verification of a public-private key pair, we implement the proof of the private key ð ð by signing a specific message with it. The corresponding codes are provided in Appendix A.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Expected Transfer Time Evaluation.</em> We compared our work with that of Engel and Xue [12]. Assuming that the probability of an option being transferred and ultimately finalized within the current network is ð, the total number of transfers is ð. Then, in their protocol, ð follows a geometric distribution, i.e. ð â¼ ðº(ð). The relationship between the expected successful transfer time and the successful transfer probability of each phase is illustrated in Figure 3, where mutate lock phase in Engel and Xueâs protocol to corresponds to the reveal phase in our protocol. When a large number of malicious nodes exist in the current network, say, the finalization probability is 10%, the duration of the mutate lock phase and the consistency phase in their protocol becomes significantly prolonged, reaching 45Î, which is approximately equivalent to 2 days in Bitcoin. By initiating the replace phase earlier and consolidating the mutate and consistency phases, we significantly reduce the duration of these phases.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Gas Consumption Evaluation</em>. Figure 4 lists the gas consumption for contract deployment, option operations, and gas consumption in different phases, where gas price is 4.131 Gwei and ETH price is $2274.87 (Sep 7, 2024). We calculate the maximum gas used for each operation. In the transfer failure case, we only calculate the gas consumption of conforming parties.</p>\n<p>\\\nNotably, as shown in Figure 4a, compared to Engel and Xueâs protocol, the gas consumption for the holder transfer process has significantly decreased from 714,867 to 510,857 gas (a reduction of approximately 28.5% for successful transfers). For failed transfers, the gas consumption decreases from 330,350 gas to 248,388 gas (a reduction of approximately 3.4%). The gas consumption of the transferring writer also decreases to a similar level. The gas consumption for exercising an option increases from 96,916 to 145,337, while the gas consumption for abandonment decreased. This is because, during an exercise, Alice needs to deposit funds and Bob must fulfill the request by revealing the exercise secret. In contrast, for an abandonment, Bob only needs to perform a refund operation.</p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 4b illustrates the gas consumption of a successful transfer across different phases. In our protocol, the reveal phase only requires the seller to reveal a signature in one contract, significantly reducing gas consumption compared to the mutate and replace/revert phases, lowering the gas for the holder and the writer to 123,158 and 123,435 gas, respectively. However, gas usage in the consistency phase is higher than that of their protocol, as we verify signatures in both contracts to ensure consistency. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe gas consumption for contract deployment in our protocol is generally higher compared to Engel and Xueâs protocol due to additional security measures and DAPS support. For instance, the deployment costs for ð¶ððð¡ðððð¡ð´ and ð¶ððð¡ðððð¡ðµ in our protocol are 2,549,610 and 2,220,156 gas, respectively.

Feature extraction ability of quadratic and conventional networks</h2>\n<p>Previously, we have theoretically demonstrated that quadratic networks possess superior cyclostationary feature extraction ability to conventional networks. It is also necessary to validate the performance in practice. Therefore, we construct two time-domain filters using quadratic convolutional layers and conventional convolutional layers with an identical structure and then evaluate their feature-extraction performance on the JNU dataset subjected to -10 dB noise.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe signals are analyzed using the Fast-SC method [84]. The results, as depicted in Figure 8, clearly demonstrate that the quadratic network outperforms in terms of feature extraction capability. The bright lines in the spectral coherence, highlight the quadratic network can extract cyclic frequency across high and low frequency bands. Despite the severe attenuation of the signal amplitude due to the noise, the quadratic network effectively recovers the cyclic frequency of the signal. Remarkably, the amplitude of the initial few cyclic frequencies is even higher than that of the raw signal.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-bp83169.png\" alt=\"Figure 8: Denosing performance of the quadratic neural network and conventional network on the JNU dataset.\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Jing-Xiao Liao, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China and School of Instrumentation Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China;</p>\n<p>(2) Chao He, School of Mechanical, Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China;</p>\n<p>(3) Jipu Li, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China;</p>\n<p>(4) Jinwei Sun, School of Instrumentation Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China;</p>\n<p>(5) Shiping Zhang (Corresponding author), School of Instrumentation Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China;</p>\n<p>(6) Xiaoge Zhang (Corresponding author), Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15341\">available on arxiv</a> under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"ChatGPT and Sora went down for the second time this month","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/chatgpt-and-sora-went-down-for-the-second-time-this-month/","date":1735245711,"author":"Maxwell Zeff","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>ChatGPT, Sora, and OpenAI&#8217;s developer-facing API were down on Thursday for more than four hours.

However, these âshallowâ ML methods invariably rely on</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3j831ev.png\" alt=\"Table 13The F1 scores (%) of the compared backbone networks on the JNU and HIT datasets.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nhuman-engineered features for bearing fault diagnosis, thereby exhibiting limited generalization ability in the design of end-to-end diagnozing models [6]. Given that ClassBD can enhance the performance of deep learning classifiers, we posit that it can also serve as a feature extractor to augment the performance of classical ML classifiers.</p>\n<p>\\\nConsequently, in this experiment, we utilize the pre-trained ClassBD as a feature extractor and feed the output of ClassBD into several ML classifiers for comparison: support vector machine (SVM) [88], k-nearest neighbor (KNN) [89], random forest (RF) [90], logistic regression (LR) [91], and a highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree (LightGBM) [92].</p>\n<p>\\\nThe results are presented in Table 14. Evidently, ClassBD significantly facilitates the performance of ML methods. Directly inputting raw signals into these ML classifiers results in markedly poor performance. On the JNU and HIT datasets, SVM and RF even fail to converge. However, with the incorporation of ClassBD, the classification performance experiences a substantial improvement. For instance, the KNN achieves a 90.71% F1 score on the JNU dataset, compared to a mere 2.89% F1 score without ClassBD. This performance even surpasses some deep learning methods. Nonetheless, ML methods exhibit instability across different datasets. The best-performing ML methods can only achieve a 49.77% score on the PU dataset. Despite this, we believe that the combination of ClassBD and ML methods presents a promising solution, promoting the study of high interpretability and efficiency in diagnostic approaches. We will explore this topic further in our future work.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-lv9317r.png\" alt=\"Table 14The F1 scores (%) of different machine learning methods on three datasets.

Amid the mass focus on infrastructure, our conversation centered on the tangible, real-world impact of blockchain technologyâa refreshing shift that highlighted the builder energy driving meaningful change.</em></strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"howdoesitfeelbeinginthailandandwhatmissionareyoubringingtodevcon\"><strong>How does it feel being in Thailand, and what mission are you bringing to Devcon?</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Anke:</strong> There are so many interesting collaborators, developers, and teams here, all trying to work on the next big thingâor rather, the next better thing. What excites me the most is the collaborative mindset this community brings. Itâs not about pushing a single solution as the \"best one\" for everyone, but instead asking, âHow can we collectively solve these problems?â That open-mindedness makes such a difference.</p>\n<p>\\n At SDF, we see this collaborative spirit as essential because we work with a wide range of startups and teams. Our mission is about creating equitable access to the global financial system, and that looks different for different contexts and communities.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anna</strong>: My main focus is leading SDFâs aid and humanitarian portfolio, where I work with organizationsâaid agencies and international organizationsâthat provide cash-based assistance and other forms of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhatâs been particularly meaningful for me is engaging directly with people from the refugee community, especially at the Funding the Commons. Now, more than ever, itâs essential that these communities are the ones shaping the solutions themselves.</p>\n<p>\\n I donât even like the term âbeneficiaries.â It feels disconnected. We need to engage the communities as active partners in designing solutions. The conversations here have given me plenty of takeaways on how the Stellar network can better serve not just refugee populations but also smaller, localized organizations closer to the ground.</p>\n<p>\\n Looking ahead, I want to focus on supporting small and medium-sized organizations. While weâve partnered with large players like UNHCR, IRC, and GIZâwho have the resources and scopeâthereâs a shift in the international community toward funding organizations closer to the ground. This localization agenda supports smaller groups that are deeply embedded in their communities.</p>\n<p>\\n Seeing the innovation from startups here makes me optimistic about how we can better serve these local groups. Itâs a tough space, but itâs where we can make a real difference by adapting to the growing focus on localization and direct impact.</p>\n<h4 id=\"letstalkaboutthepotentialofblockchainforthosepurposes\">Letâs talk about the potential of blockchain for those purposesâ¦</h4>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong>: In the financial inclusion space, which is closely related to but slightly separate from humanitarian work, the challenges are massive. About one-third of the world doesnât have a bank account, which means theyâre excluded from the traditional financial system. This limits their ability to save, invest, or take out even small loans. For those of us living in countries where access to banking is taken for granted, it can be eye-opening to realize how widespread this exclusion is.</p>\n<p>\\n Blockchain offers a way for people to immediately connect to a global system that doesnât rely on formal banking relationships. Itâs decentralized, allowing individuals to access financial tools without intermediaries.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor example, Decaf, a wallet provider on the Stellar network, has connected women and rural communities in Colombia to the financial system. This has helped create circular economies and encouraged reinvestment in local communities. Even in areas without ATMs or banks, access to basic technology like a smartphone and the Internet can provide financial opportunities.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anke</strong>: Exactly! Blockchain makes it possible to transfer valueâwhether money or informationâwithout needing to trust an intermediary like a bank. Instead, you trust the system itself. This has opened doors for small developer teams or even solo developers, allowing them to set up reliable services and scale quickly.</p>\n<p>\\n We work with teams from the ground up, helping them grow on the Stellar network. Many of these startups are based in regions like Africa and Latin America, where they deeply understand and meet the needs of their communities.</p>\n<p>\\n For instance, HoneyCoin in Kenya has integrated with M-Pesa, the local mobile money network. This allows anyone, including myself, when I visited Kenya, to use the wallet to pay vendors or individuals seamlessly. Local users can also top up their wallets, save in a stable currency, and even access DeFi protocols using Stellar smart contracts. This unlocks opportunities for saving and investing that many had never experienced before.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnother example is ClickPesa Debt Fund, which provides lending opportunities for small Tanzanian businesses in need of capital powered by a financial protocol on Stellar. Even without formal credit, people can access funding to grow their business, which drives economic opportunities in their area.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anna</strong>: We really care about \"blockchain for the real world.\" This means addressing the fact that most people still need to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. Our strength lies in our network of off-ramps, which make that process easy and accessible.</p>\n<p>\\n One of our key partnerships is with MoneyGram International. This allows people to cash out their crypto at any MoneyGram location worldwide. A great example is our collaboration with UNHCR in Ukraine. Theyâve used this system to disburse over $5 million in aid, which recipients can cash out at MoneyGram locationsâeven across borders. This system offers a practical solution for displaced people or those in conflict zones, enabling them to safely transport their money and always have access to local fiat currency.</p>\n<p>\\n Another innovation is adapting traditional money management methods to blockchain. Bousol, a wallet in Haiti, addresses liquidity challenges by keeping digital currency within the ecosystem. Theyâve adapted the concept of a rotating savings accountâa traditional system where individuals contribute monthly and take turns accessing a lump sum.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy bringing this on-chain, Bousol allows participants to borrow from others in case of emergencies, ensuring they stay current in the savings pool. This merges traditional practices with blockchain technology, addressing the needs of unbanked or underbanked populations.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhatâs exciting is how these solutions combine traditional and new systems. They adapt to local contexts while making financial tools more accessible, bridging the gap between traditional and modern finance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"whydoesstellarworksowellforthefinancialinclusionusecase\">Why does Stellar work so well for the financial inclusion use case?</h4>\n<p><strong>Anke</strong>: At the core of Stellarâs success is its dual structure: the Stellar network, an open-source blockchain designed for payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and financial services, and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), a nonprofit supporting the network. The SDF is focused on creating equitable access to the global financial system, prioritizing transparency and accessibility for everyone.</p>\n<p>\\\nThrough initiatives like the Stellar Community Fund and targeted grants, the SDF and the wider community foster projects that turn financial innovation into real-world impact. These projectsâranging from wallets and DeFi protocols to infrastructure for on and off-rampingâare key to advancing both financial inclusion and humanitarian efforts. The collaborative, mission-driven Stellar ecosystem makes it easier for teams to scale solutions that directly benefit underserved communities.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen it comes to the blockchain itself, one of the standout advantages of Stellar is its incredibly low transaction costsâaround one ten-thousandth of a US cent per transaction. This cost efficiency is especially important for financial inclusion, where small, frequent transactions are common. High fees are a barrier for many users, but with the low-cost Stellar structure, those barriers are largely removed, making it possible to send funds affordably, even for low-value transactions.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is particularly critical for humanitarian organizations, which often handle bulk paymentsâthink $100, $500, or $700 disbursements spread across hundreds or thousands of recipients. On other blockchains, these bulk transactions wouldnât be financially viable due to high fees. But with the Stellar cost structure, organizations can create scalable, practical solutions to address real-world challenges, whether in emergency relief or long-term financial inclusion initiatives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"canyousharemoreaboutsomeofyourmajorcollaborations\">Can you share more about some of your major collaborations?</h4>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong>: One of SDFâsflagship projects is with UNHCR. They partnered with us to develop an open-source software platform for bulk cash disbursements called the Stellar Disbursement Platform. This platform was designed to enable rapid, low-cost, and transparent cash transfers and was born when conflict broke out in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\\n UNHCR needed a way to move funds into Ukraine quickly, minimizing transaction costs. The Stellar Disbursement Platform allows for bulk disbursements at almost no costâaround 10,000 transactions per cent. Since its launch, itâs helped deliver nearly $5 million to more than 2,500 families in Ukraine and is now expanding to other geographies.</p>\n<p>\\n Recipients access their funds via a link sent by SMS or email. They can then receive digital currency into wallets like Vibrant, Decaf, or Beans. Off-ramps such as MoneyGram or local options, depending on the country, allow people to cash out in the most convenient way for their location.</p>\n<p>\\n In regions with limited smartphone or internet access, or where fiat systems are strained, weâve also worked on localized solutions. For instance, in Syria, weâve partnered with GIZ on a payroll program for hospital workers. Before using the Stellar network, payroll distribution took months, and workers had to visit cash-out points up to nine times. Now, payments are made directly and efficiently, reducing delays and improving safety.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anke</strong>: And in Lebanon, one of our partners faced transaction costs of up to 40% to get money into the country. With Stellar, the fees are negligible. Currently, MoneyGram offers a subsidy for aid recipients, so they pay no fees to cash out. For other transactions, like remittances, the fee is around 2%, a significant improvement over traditional systems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"whenworkingwithbuilderswhatarethemostcommonerrorstheymakeorobstaclestheyface\">When working with builders, what are the most common errors they make or obstacles they face?</h4>\n<p><strong>Anke</strong>: The biggest challenge is understanding the market and figuring out how to distribute your product effectively. Today, tools like Repl.it or even AI make it easier to quickly create a product. You can build an MVP in no time, but the real challenge is proving thereâs a market for it. Thatâs why, with our Stellar Community Fund Build Award, we ask projects to demonstrate their market value.</p>\n<p>\\n This means doing things like user research, running beta interviews, gathering early users, or getting validation from other companies in the ecosystem. Once you can prove the need, we provide funding to help the team move forward. Then, the focus shifts to finding product-market fitâtesting marketing strategies, iterating, and pivoting as needed.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anna</strong>: Especially when solving for financial inclusion, understanding the real need is crucial. It's important to have intellectual humilityâacknowledging that you donât know all the answers. Instead of assuming what people need, work directly with the community youâre trying to serve. Understand the problem from their perspective, not from your assumptions.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anke</strong>: You canât be building in a vacuum. The best products are the ones that constantly check in with users. When adding new features, they seek feedback before moving forward. Projects that try to create the âperfect productâ in isolation tend to fail. You need to stay flexible and be ready to pivot.</p>\n<p>\\n This is something we stress in our Kickstart Bootcamp. We help founders shift their mindset. Many hesitate to share their ideas early, saying, âItâs not ready yet.â My response is always, âNo one cares if itâs perfect right now.â Itâs not about protecting your ideaâitâs about executing it well. Ideas are easy to come by; itâs the execution that counts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"becauseaproductisnevergoingtobefullyreadyright\">Because a product is never going to be fully ready, right?</h4>\n<p><strong>Anke</strong>: Absolutely. It might not be perfect, but get it out there, try it, pivot, and ship again. Most teams go through at least one pivotâit's normal. Your first idea isnât usually your best. The most successful builders are those who persevere, stay open to feedback, and are willing to adapt when necessary. The key right now is figuring out how to stand out with distribution. Thatâs where a lot of builders can really make a difference.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe ClickPesa Debt Fund is my favorite example of this. Theyâve been part of the Stellar community for around seven years and have gone through multiple pivots, faced roadblocks along the way, and kept pushing forward. At one point, they hit a regulatory wall with one of their initiatives. Instead of giving up, they adapted, found a new direction, and kept building.</p>\n<p>\\n Now, with Stellar smart contracts, theyâve connected with protocols like Blend and tools like Mercury as an indexer. These pieces helped them launch a debt fund where users can deploy capital and earn yield. Theyâre currently focused on microfinance institutions (MFIs) that support women-owned small and medium-sized businesses.</p>\n<p>\\n Whatâs exciting is how it combines doing good with creating financial opportunitiesâyou can earn money while supporting businesses that need it. This is the future weâre building with the Stellar DeFi narrative.</p>\n<h4 id=\"istheresomethingyoudliketoseemoreofintheweb3space\">Is there something youâd like to see more of in the Web3 space?</h4>\n<p><strong>Anna</strong>: Definitely more projects focused on social good! Even within the Stellar ecosystem, weâve seen that itâs possible to be both profitable and mission-driven. Many of our partners manage to do both, which is inspiring.</p>\n<p>\\n In the humanitarian space, there are still major challengesâlike internet connectivity, lack of cell phones, and absence of ID. These are tough problems, and we need to partner with othersâwhether in Web3 or notâto solve them.</p>\n<p>\\n It would be great to see the community push these barriers further. But the hope is that weâll eventually find ways to reach those hardest to help.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anke</strong>: I completely agree. Another area Iâm passionate about is governance and human coordination. Coordination is a challenge not just in Web3, but in the world at large. While there have been experiments, none have scaled enough to address broader societal issues.</p>\n<p>\\n Iâd like to see more focus on collaboration in governance. Can we put egos aside and build systems that work at scale? And can we design systems that are easier for the general public to engage with, helping us all coordinate better? If we get this right, it could help us work more effectively as a global community.</p>\n<h4 id=\"soisthereaninterestinggovernanceinitiativeyoureexcitedabout\">So, is there an interesting governance initiative youâre excited about?</h4>\n<p><strong>Anke</strong>: There are a few, but one Iâm really excited about is reputation-based governance and flexible delegation models. At the Stellar Community Fund, weâre implementing decentralized decision-making processes supported by Neural Quorum Governance, which combines reputation-based voting power attribution with opt-in delegation.</p>\n<p>\\n What I find most exciting is the potential for governance models that can scale beyond Web3. Iâm also inspired by research into governing the commons, like Elinor Ostromâs work. Thereâs a gap between the technical work happening in Web3 and the real-world research on governance. If we could bring those together, we could build something really impactful.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anna</strong>: Blockchain foundations have a role to play in this space. They can help de-risk projects that governments, NGOs, or large organizations might hesitate to take on. These groups are cautious about experimenting with blockchain, especially crypto, because of their accountability to donors and taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\\n Blockchain foundations can test new ideas, prove their usefulness, and scale them without putting donor money at risk. We also help smooth the process by addressing regulatory and legal barriers, which vary by country.</p>\n<p>\\\nOur role includes funding pilots that may fail, learning from those failures, and making it easier for organizations to adopt these solutions.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Anke</strong>: Exactly. Blockchain foundations are in a good position to take on risk by supporting novel ideas and informing policy. Ideally, weâd see more collaboration between foundations to create a more unified approach. Unfortunately, many foundations treat each other as competitors.</p>\n<p>\\\nDenelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of SDF, has been actively engaging with policymakers in Congress and other government forums. But we need more foundations working together to advocate for sensible regulations and show how this technology can be used responsibly.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"6G-AI Mashups Will Reshape the Telecom Industry","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-ai-mashup","date":1735239603,"author":"Shashi Raj Pandey","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>EU-U.S. joint initiatives are paving the way for next-gen wireless networks</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM5MzQ4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Njc4Njk5M30.pXJ_ULd_m4voeDiJwKghWc7oAMv_kZaQ0g4Ht-OidOk/image.jpg?width=600","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Amazon's $8.45 Billion Gamble Clashes with Broccoli Family's Iron Grip on 007","url":"https://hackernoon.com/amazons-$845-billion-gamble-clashes-with-broccoli-familys-iron-grip-on-007?source=rss","date":1735238711,"author":"David Deal","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>James Bond and Amazon are at war with each other in a clash between an Old Hollywood studio and a digital New Hollywood brand. Advantage: James Bond.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere are the two players in this epic struggle as reported in&nbsp;<em><strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em>:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the one hand, Amazon has a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/amazon-mgm-and-the-triumph-of-new-hollywood-k2l366v\">50% stake in the James Bond franchise through its acquisition of MGM</a></strong>. Amazon wants to tap into the value of that franchise to create a multi-faceted cash cow, including movies, TV shows, spinoffs, and even a re-imaging of James Bond at a fundamental level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>But Amazon does not have full control over the James Bond name. The Broccoli family, through their company EON Productions, has maintained creative control over the James Bond film franchise since its inception. And the Broccolis are unhappy with Amazonâs ambitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nSince the Broccolis control the Bond brand, we wonât be seeing Bond movies onscreen anytime soon. And this is a major problem with Amazon, which needs to exhibit tentpole movies in theaters to drive their streaming success. But Amazon has cash and muscle. As New Hollywood increasingly understands how to monetize the offline/online interplay between entertainment, Amazon will likely play it the way the Broccolis want it â for now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"amazonsgoldeneyecashinginonthevalueofafranchise\">Amazonâs GoldenEye: Cashing In on the Value of a Franchise</h2>\n<p>In 2021, Amazon acquired MGM Studios for $8.45 billion. MGM co-owns the rights to the James Bond film franchise alongside Danjaq LLC, which is controlled by EON Productions (and thus by Barbara Broccoli and her half brother Michael G. Wilson). This acquisition gave Amazon access to MGMâs extensive film library and intellectual property, including its 50% stake in James Bond.</p>\n<p>\\\nAmazon is not content to have access to movies. Amazon wants to create entertainment options beyond movies. This is not surprising. Amazon views entertainment as a means to generate revenue multiple streams, including Prime memberships -- to sell more baby wipes, coffee, vacuum cleaners, acne patches, and more. As Jeff Bezos once famously said, â<strong><a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/anecdote-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-124500484.html\">When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes</a></strong>.â So, when Amazon has access to a lucrative franchise, the company milks its value.</p>\n<p>\\\nCase in point: the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;(<em>LOTR</em>). Amazon has monetized the&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>&nbsp;franchise primarily through its streaming platform, Amazon Prime Video, while using&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>&nbsp;to enhance its brand, attract subscribers, and explore merchandising and licensing opportunities:</p>\n<h3 id=\"primevideosubscriptions\">Prime Video Subscriptions</h3>\n<p>Amazonâs primary strategy with its&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>&nbsp;series,&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>, is to drive subscriptions to Amazon Prime. By offering exclusive access to the show, Amazon aims to attract fans of the franchise and new viewers globally. This approach helps increase the number of Prime subscribers, who pay $139 annually or $8.99 monthly for Prime Video alone. The series serves as a flagship product to boost customer loyalty and retention within the competitive streaming market.</p>\n<h3 id=\"brandexpansionandprestige\">Brand Expansion and Prestige</h3>\n<p>Amazon also views the series as a long-term play to enhance the prestige of its brand and establish itself as a major player in entertainment. By associating with a globally beloved name like&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>, Amazon aims to position itself alongside streaming giants like Netflix and Disney+. This strategy aligns with Jeff Bezosâs original vision of creating a&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>-level cultural phenomenon that generates buzz and awards recognition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"merchandisesales\">Merchandise Sales</h3>\n<p>Amazon is capitalizing on the&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>&nbsp;franchiseâs merchandising potential. From action figures to apparel,&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>-related products have historically been highly sought after by fans. By selling merchandise through its eCommerce platform, Amazon can create additional revenue streams tied directly to the series.</p>\n<h3 id=\"licensingdeals\">Licensing Deals</h3>\n<p>Amazon has opportunities to monetize through licensing agreements for video games, tabletop games, and other products based on the&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>&nbsp;universe. Such deals allow Amazon to extend the franchiseâs reach while earning royalties from third-party creators.</p>\n<h3 id=\"longtermfranchisedevelopment\">Long-Term Franchise Development</h3>\n<p>Amazonâs $250 million rights acquisition includes a commitment to producing five seasons of&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>, with total costs projected to exceed $1 billion when factoring in production and marketing expenses. Beyond the main series, Amazon may explore spin-offs or other Middle-earth content, which could further monetize the franchise over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"boostingrelatedsales\">Boosting Related Sales</h3>\n<p>The release of&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>&nbsp;has reportedly driven increased sales of Tolkienâs books and related media on Amazonâs retail platform. This cross-promotion benefits both the streaming service and eCommerce divisions, reinforcing Amazonâs ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"globalreach\">Global Reach</h3>\n<p>With Tolkienâs works enjoying worldwide popularity, Amazon has positioned&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>&nbsp;as a global product available in multiple languages via Prime Video. This international appeal broadens its audience base and maximizes revenue potential from diverse markets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"indirectbenefits\">Indirect Benefits</h3>\n<p>While direct profitability from&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>&nbsp;may be challenging given its massive production costs (e.g., $465 million for Season 1 alone), Amazon benefits indirectly by increasing overall engagement with its ecosystem. For example: Prime members who join for&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>&nbsp;may also use Amazonâs retail services. The series enhances investor confidence by showcasing Amazonâs ability to compete in high-stakes entertainment markets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shakennotstirredthebroccolifamilysrisktakinglegacy\">Shaken, Not Stirred: The Broccoli Familyâs Risk-Taking Legacy</h2>\n<p>Despite owning 50% of the franchise through MGM, Amazon does not have full control over James Bond. The Broccoli family retains ironclad creative control through EON Productions. Albert R. âCubbyâ Broccoli, along with Harry Saltzman, co-founded EON Productions in 1961 to bring Ian Flemingâs James Bond novels to the screen. Broccoliâs family has maintained control over the creative direction of the franchise ever since. Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who run EON, are considered the custodians of the James Bond character and hold significant authority over all aspects of the films, including casting, scripts, and marketing decisions. This means that any new Bond films, spin-offs, or projects must receive their approval. The Broccolis decide when a new Bond film is made, who plays the iconic role, and whether spin-offs or remakes are allowed. The family also proceeds at its own pace. Years can pass between one Bond film and the next.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Broccolis view James Bond as a sacred name that not only generates revenue but influences culture. They are protective of how the James Bond name is licensed. And they treat the release of a James Bond movie as a global event akin to the Super Bowl. For the Broccolis, Bond lives and dies in theaters. The Broccolis have resisted efforts to expand Bond into areas like television series or cinematic universes. This doesnât mean that the Broccolis are unwilling to license the Bond name. They may have standards, but they ainât stupid. The Broccolis understand that keeping the Bond name relevant requires flexibility. For example, EON Productions has partnered with various game developers to create James Bond-themed video games. Activision held the rights from 2006 to 2014 to develop games based on Bond films and original storylines. Earlier successes include&nbsp;<em>GoldenEye</em>&nbsp;<em>007</em>&nbsp;(1997), which became a cultural phenomenon. James Bondâs iconic Aston Martin vehicles have appeared in video games like Rocket League as part of cross-promotional licensing deals. This strategy introduces the brand to younger audiences through popular gaming platforms</p>\n<p>\\\nEON Productions and MGM partnered with Scientific Games in 2017 to license James Bond for slot machines, lottery games, and social gaming platforms. This deal allowed for the integration of iconic elements from past and future Bond films into casino experiences. This makes sense given the association of the Bond name with casino gambling.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Broccolis are also risk takers, such as casting unknowns to play the lead â a risk that famously paid off when Daniel Craig was chosen to play Bond in 2005. The decision was controversial. Craig was an unknown. Critics scoffed. But the Broccolis had the last laugh: Daniel Craig helped fuel James Bond to artistic and commercial heights. He updated Bond for the 21st&nbsp;Century and ensured 007âs cultural relevance.</p>\n<p>\\\nReportedly, the Broccolis have baffled Amazon with their willingness to take creative risks with the Bond name, especially with the Broccoliâs willingness to cast unknowns for the lead role, which is difficult to swallow for Amazon decision makers. Amazon calculates factors such as an actorâs known bankability. Not surprisingly, Amazon reportedly wants more say into who plays Bond.</p>\n<p>\\\nMeanwhile, in an early meeting with the Broccolis, Amazon Studios referred to James Bond as âcontent.â As reported in&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, such a sterile term was a red flag to the Broccolis that James Bond was nothing more than a commodity to Amazon.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe wonât be seeing any Bond movies until the Broccolis and Amazon agree on fundamental issues such as who plays Bond. The Broccolis hold the cards, and they are patient. We last saw James Bond onscreen in 2021, with&nbsp;<em>No Time to Die</em>. Before that, Bond last appeared in 2015 with&nbsp;<em>Spectre</em>. In the digital age, years are like centuries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"liveandletstream\">Live and Let Stream</h2>\n<p>The impasse comes at a time when New Hollywood and Old Hollywood are rethinking the value of movies shown in theaters. On the one hand, the film industry is enduring a difficult time. Worldwide movie ticket sales in 2024 are projected at $31.5 billion, which is lower than the $33.4 billion forecast for 2023 and 25% below the pre-pandemic peak of $42.3 billion in 2019. Total ticket sales have declined noticeably from 2000 to 2024. But in one important way, theatrical releases of movies are becoming more valuable: by stoking demand for their eventual release on streaming platforms.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;reports,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/business/media/streaming-movies-theaters.html\">the value of theatrical releases as a driver for streaming success</a></strong>&nbsp;is becoming increasingly clear in the entertainment industry â including Amazon Prime Video. For example, Amazon Studios poured a hefty $250 million into producing&nbsp;<em>Red One</em>, a comedic holiday action movie featuring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans. The company then backed the film with a major theatrical rollout, debuting in over 4,000 theaters and spending tens of millions on marketing.</p>\n<p>\\\nWith the domestic box office pulling in just $80 million â half of which is shared with theater operators â the movie might seem like a significant misstep. But according to Courtenay Valenti, Amazonâs head of film, Amazon invested the money to make&nbsp;<em>Red One</em>&nbsp;a streaming sensation.</p>\n<p>\\\nAmazon reports that when&nbsp;<em>Red One</em>&nbsp;appeared on Prime Video,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/red-one-prime-video-50-million-viewers-1236251153/\">it quickly claimed the top spot as the platformâs most popular movie, attracting 50 million viewers globally within its first four days</a></strong>. The film marked the most-watched streaming debut in Amazon MGM Studiosâ history, all while continuing its theatrical run on over 3,000 screens across North America.</p>\n<p>\\\nAmazon has plenty of competition in its quest to achieve offline/online success. Paramount said that the theatrical release of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>&nbsp;sparked a 207% rise in interest for earlier entries in the&nbsp;<em>Quiet Place</em>&nbsp;franchise that were streaming on the Paramount+ streaming service.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd when&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>&nbsp;hit theaters in May, Disney-owned Hulu offered subscribers an âexclusive lookâ at the film. This movie built anticipation for the theatrical release and also encouraged viewers to explore the eight other&nbsp;<em>Planet of the Apes</em>&nbsp;films available in Huluâs library. When&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>&nbsp;screened in theaters, the filmâs visibility then built anticipation for its release on streaming. Talk about creating a virtuous circle.</p>\n<p>\\\nStreaming is also giving poorly reviewed movies a second chance with audiences unwilling to spend money on a flop (<em>Joker: Folie Ã  Deux</em>, trashed by critics and a financial flop in theaters, is a hit on MAX.)</p>\n<p>\\\nOn HackerNoon,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/what-does-the-future-hold-for-the-new-hollywood-streaming-industry\">I wrote about this phenomenon a few years ago</a></strong>&nbsp;as the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic forced studios to figure out how to distribute movies online and in theaters amid uncertainty over when people would return to movie theaters and how often they would attend. Some studios sold movies originally intended for theaters directly to streaming services. Others experimented with simultaneously releasing films in movie theaters and streaming services, known as day-and-date releases.</p>\n<p>\\\nBut studios that gambled on exhibiting movies in theaters discovered that sometimes they could have it both ways: enjoy a hit in the theaters followed by streaming success. For example, in 2022,&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em>&nbsp;earned $750 million globally before Warner Brothers premiered the film the HBO Max streaming service.&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em>&nbsp;then enjoyed a first-week viewership of an estimated 4.1 million households (per Samba TV) â the second best first-week for a theatrical release on HBO Max. One of the biggest movie success stories of 2022 (or any year),&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, took&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/11/top-gun-maverick-paramount-plus-streaming-date-1235179876/?ref=hackernoon.com\">seven months</a></strong>&nbsp;to arrive on its studioâs streamer (Paramount+), which didnât stop it from immediately becoming the serviceâs&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/top-gun-maverick-paramount-most-watched-movie-1235475140/?ref=hackernoon.com\">â1 offering</a></strong>.&nbsp;<em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>&nbsp;banked $842 million globally during an 82-day run in theaters â and then&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/marvel-studios-black-panther-wakanda-forever-is-the-most-watched-marvel-film-premiere-on-disney-globally?ref=hackernoon.com\">became the most-watched Marvel premiere on Disney+ based on hours streamed within the first five days</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow the tail is wagging the dog. Studios see theatrical releases as a means to a streaming end. They are figuring out how to manage this interplay with effective marketing.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe biggest winners are Old Hollywood/New Hollywood hybrids like Disney, Paramount, and WarnerBros. Discovery that already possess film distribution and marketing know-how. And credit must be given to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. When the WarnerBros. Discovery merger was announced in 2022, Zaslav articulated a blueprint for how New and Old Hollywood are operating now. Zaslav&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/warner-bros-discovery-wont-overspend-to-win-streaming-subscribers-ceo-david-zaslav-says-11650977570?mod=article_inline&ref=hackernoon.com\">said</a></strong>, âWe are not trying to win the direct-to-consumer spending war.â He noted that company would resist the trend of taking movies directly to streaming amid a pandemic-era decline in moviegoing. Instead, he actually increased the number of theatrical releases for the companyâs movies.</p>\n<p>\\\nHe reasoned that movies in theaters would create buzz for their eventual streaming release while making box office revenues at the same time. âThereâs an ecosystem of economic return when you open something in the theaters,â he said during an analyst conference in November 2022. For instance, the WarnerBros. movie&nbsp;<em>Elvis</em>&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://movieweb.com/elvis-producer-success-explain/?ref=hackernoon.com\">smash in theaters</a></strong>&nbsp;before going to HBO Max,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/oscars-best-picture-most-viewed-nielsen-elvis-streaming-1235541283/?ref=hackernoon.com\">where it also proved to be popular</a></strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"advertisingroyalehowtheatricalreleasesshapestreamingads\">Advertising Royale: How Theatrical Releases Shape Streaming Ads</h2>\n<p>Theatrical releases are important for another major reason: bolstering the advertising models for streaming platforms like Amazon, Disney, Netflix, and Paramount+.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheatrical releases enable streaming platforms like Amazon, Disney+, Netflix, and Paramount+ to enhance their advertising strategies by creating more compelling and targeted campaigns. For example, when a film transitions from theaters to a streaming platformâs ad-supported tier, advertisers benefit from the platformâs ability to identify patterns in viewer engagement. By analyzing aggregated data from pre-release marketing campaigns, box office performance, and eventual streaming metrics, platforms can offer advertisers tailored slots that align with audience preferences. These highly curated ad placements tend to deliver stronger results, such as improved ad recall and higher click-through rates.</p>\n<p>\\\nAdvertisers are particularly drawn to the ability of streaming platforms to segment their audience based on first-party data. For instance, after a theatrical release, Amazon might use behavioral insights from its retail ecosystem â such as consumer purchases of related merchandise or engagement with promotional content â to predict which audience segments are most likely to stream the movie. Armed with this information, Amazon Ads can deliver highly targeted campaigns on Prime Video, serving ads for products or services that align with the viewerâs interests. For example, a viewer who purchased tickets to a theatrical action movie might later see ads for travel gear or high-end gadgets tailored to their demographic, increasing the likelihood of ad engagement.</p>\n<p>\\\nUnlike traditional streaming platforms, Amazon can integrate its eCommerce capabilities with Prime Video ads, enabling product placement and direct shopping opportunities. For instance, viewers could see an ad for a product featured in a movie â like a James Bond film -- and purchase it immediately through Amazonâs retail platform. This creates a closed-loop system where advertising drives sales within Amazonâs ecosystem, further boosting revenue streams. Additionally, by offering premium content supported by ads, Amazon can attract price-sensitive consumers who might otherwise avoid subscription fees, expanding its audience base while maintaining profitability.</p>\n<p>\\\nDisney+, using its integration with Disneyâs broader ecosystem, similarly enriches its advertising by combining viewer insights from theatrical campaigns with proprietary subscriber data. When a major film becomes available on Disney+, advertisers are offered premium slots during the high-traffic premiere period. These ads can feature immersive formats, such as interactive overlays or exclusive brand sponsorships, allowing brands to align themselves with blockbuster content and engage viewers on a deeper level. This strategy works particularly well for Disney+, as its ad-supported tier draws from a family-oriented audience, enabling brands to focus on cross-generational products with a strong emotional appeal.</p>\n<p>\\\nPlatforms like Paramount+ go a step further by tying advertising opportunities to the broader lifecycle of a film franchise. When&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>&nbsp;debuted in theaters, Paramount+ used the event to promote related streaming content, bundling ad slots that spanned both the theatrical lead-up and the streaming release. Advertisers could opt for integrated campaigns, such as showing trailers for upcoming movies or launching thematic ad creatives tied to the filmâs suspenseful tone. This multi-phase strategy extends the ad lifecycle, giving advertisers multiple touchpoints to interact with highly engaged audiences.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy capitalizing on the cultural momentum of theatrical releases, streaming platforms transform ad-supported streaming into a high-value proposition for advertisers. These platforms provide an ecosystem where ads are become integrated parts of the viewer experience. For advertisers, this approach helps make sure that campaigns are both contextually relevant and strategically timed, resulting in higher engagement rates, better conversion outcomes, and greater ROI.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn 2024 alone, over-the-top (OTT) ad spending in the U.S.&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.dunhamandcompany.com/digital/2024-digital-advertising-trends-ott-growth-and-social-media-shifts/?t\">exceeded $10 billion in the first eight months</a></strong>. Amazon positions itself to capture a significant share of this expanding market while capitalizing on its unique ability to connect entertainment with commerce â but the key is to master the interplay between theatrical releases and streaming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jamesbondwillreturn\">James Bond Will Return</h2>\n<p>In the digital age, there are few cultural phenomenon with the ability to make us drop what we are doing and really pay close attention. The Super Bowl is one. A Bond movie is another. And now, Bond has the ability to not only capture our attention but also keep it through its second life on streaming. Amazon knows this. Thatâs why Bond will return â the Broccoli way. Down the road, if Amazon can build trust with the Broccolis, I do believe itâs possible for the Broccolis to agree to more creative ways to share James Bond with the world beyond movies. Theyâve done it before, as noted above. They can do it again.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Scientists Explore Longevity Drugs For Dogs That Could Also 'Extend Human Life'","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/26/1824221/scientists-explore-longevity-drugs-for-dogs-that-could-also-extend-human-life?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735237440,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"U.S. biotech startup Loyal plans to launch a lifespan-extending drug for dogs in early 2025, potentially offering insights into human longevity.

Over time, Iâve learned that</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>The key to success in project delivery is being a jack-of-all-trades.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nYou need to manage the project, of course, but to successfully complete and deliver the project to production - most of the times you should also take ownership of the product youâre building. Additionally, you will act as a project analyst, an architect, conduct behavioral analytics, and dive deep into data to understand what to expect and what to improve with each new iteration.</p>\n<p>\\\nYou will act as a psychologist to your teammates; play dumb when the situation calls for it, and, at other times, think beyond your assigned role and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\\\nYou will stick your nose into design, content, and user flows. Youâll play a role of a content manager and fix some stuff yourself if its needed. And surely, you will take on a sense of responsibility for the result, even when itâs technically not supposed to fall entirely on you.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt takes a mix of soft and hard skills to roll out a project successfully and on time. ==And here are <strong>a few very practical tricks</strong> I use and believe to be extremely effective.==</p>\n<h2 id=\"1learn\">1. Learn</h2>\n<p><strong>Learn the basics</strong> <strong>(at least) of everything that might help you.</strong> And know that this is a never-ending process. There always will be something new youâll have to learn and apply to keep being successful in projects delivery.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn Agile methodology.</strong> Even a basic understanding of Agile principles can be extremely helpful, especially when working in IT.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic SQL knowledge</strong> has allowed me to quickly answer simple data questions directly from the database. I donât  need to create tasks for analytics teams or wait for them to complete requests. Instead, I can get answers to my marketing questions quickly and independently. And yes, even some basics of SQL are enough to do so. What typical marketer asks and consider important is a pretty basic for data analysts, but they do usually have a huge backlog, and you might wait too long for some basic info that is crucial for decision making, but annoying as a task for data analysts.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> â now with GA4 God bless us all with this new version! But learning how to create dashboards that answer performance questions on your own saves you tons of time and ensures your decisions are data-driven from the start.</li>\n<li>Due to the same reason (to be data-driven), <strong>know your CRM and data structure</strong>. If your company uses Salesforce, invest time in understanding the differences between objects, the data structure, and basic reporting. Being able to quickly find answers to your questions is an invaluable skill.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn basic HTML.</strong> Spend some time learning how to read it and make simple edits. At the very least, train yourself to use tools like ChatGPT to assist you with it.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn Excel.</strong> It feels like thereâs no end to the features and advanced tricks you can discover in Excel. Every year, I make time to complete a new course on Excel how-toâs, and Iâm always amazed at how much I still donât knowâitâs just the tip of the iceberg!</li>\n<li><strong>Find unexpected skills that can help in surprising ways.</strong> For example:</li>\n<li>I completed a three-year interior design course that included composition, color studies, and other disciplines. This knowledge has been incredibly helpful in communicating with UI design teams. It has given me the ability to provide professional feedback and collaborate effectively, which I believe has led to the best results.</li>\n<li>I worked as a radio DJ for a while, and this experience has made me comfortable conducting calls or meetings. I donât overthink or overprepare because I trust my improvisation skills to guide the conversation effectively.</li>\n<li>Knowing the basics of different languages (and overall, Iâve tried to learn around seven different languages) helped me perform a content manager's job better and even identify issues with translations.</li>\n<li>Finally, <strong>learn how to use AI</strong> to assist you. Spend some time learning how to write effective prompts that can help you with coding, design, or text-related tasks. For example, as a non-native English speaker, I often check the grammar and tone of my writing using available, free AI tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2document\"><strong>2. Document</strong></h2>\n<p>This might sound obvious, as itâs a fundamental principle of nearly every project management methodology, but Iâve seen countless examples where proper project documentation was missing. As well as the absence of clear tasks structure, no connections between several tasks under a single project epic âso let me start with this: ==document your projects== and never underestimate the importance of this step.</p>\n<p>\\\nDepending on the nature and scope of your project, it might include the following milestones:</p>\n<h3 id=\"21answerthequestionwhyarewedoingthis\">2.1 Answer the question: âWhy are we doing this?â</h3>\n<p>In other words, create a <strong>==Business requirements==</strong> where you clearly define all business goals for the activity, including targets, and KPIs.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Donâts:</strong> What you should avoid doing is assigning tasks to the team without having clear business requirements in place. In large companies, there may be many different stakeholders requesting multidirectional updates to existing workflows or the creation of new ones (these requests could come from Sales, Product Management, the CEO directlyâyou name it). If you, as a project manager, lack an internal filter to prioritize and consolidate these requirements into a clear and agreed-upon \"to-be\" state that suits all parties, you risk creating chaos! Sometimes, a single page that consolidates and visualizes these diverse requests can help decision-makers clearly see the multidirectional requests, align, prioritize and define the proper next steps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nAlso, because itâs always better to <strong>==be data-driven==</strong>, provide a snapshot of the current stateâunless the project is entirely new and thereâs nothing to analyze. Analyzing how things work today can help define KPIs and identify opportunities for optimization and improvement. Include everything you haveâsuch as all collected metrics, scroll and heat maps, flow analytics, customer feedback, results of UX research, etc. All of this will contribute to creating a well-informed and effective future roadmap (or may lead to a decision to cancel the project).</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter that, youâll be able to create a high-level project overview and <strong>==a preliminary roadmap==</strong> that outlines the main milestones and deliverables. Additionally, you should prepare a project charter that specifies responsibilities, identifies decision-makers, and provides a preliminary estimate of the resources required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22answerthequestionhowarewedoingthis\">2.2 Answer the question: âHow are we doing this?â</h3>\n<p>This can be fulfilled by creating several different requirement documents, such as:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Technical requirements:</strong> Collaborate with your developers to draft, review and sign off on technical documentation. Separate backend and front-end requirements. Involve architects when needed. Consult with QA early on to ensure their involvement and understanding of the project scope.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Content requirements:</strong> Ensure input from both the Product Marketing and SEO teams is includedâthis forms the foundation of your future traffic.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> In todayâs landscape, compliance, privacy, and other legal aspects must be addressed upfront. Make sure you adhere to all relevant legal checklists.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Design mockups:</strong> Finalized and detailed design mockups with documented flows and behaviors are essential before development begins. Ensure all breakpoints are included and designs are approved by stakeholders. For complex projects, start with wireframes, and have them approved before moving on to the design stage.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tracking markup:</strong> Ensure that appropriate tracking and analytics requirements are documented to capture the necessary data.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having all this documentation in place will enable all teams to begin the implementation process smoothly. Youâll address most questions upfront, ensuring everyone has clear visibility into what exactly is expected under this project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23answerthequestionwhenarewedoingthis\">2.3 Answer the question: âWhen are we doing this?â</h3>\n<p>Once all requirements are collected, designs are finalized and approved, and technical documentation is ready, you can move to the implementation stage.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/IkC3RJ0dhpfyCTOwCY6m6VlQz542-r4335ar.jpeg\" alt=\"Gantt chart ensample using TeamGantt \" title=\"left-50\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timeline or/and Gantt chart:</strong> Develop a granular project overview, allocating time and resources to each specific task. This will provide clarity on the project schedule and ensure proper planning for each phase.</li>\n<li><strong>Assign people.</strong></li>\n<li>You can also include the documentation and design phases in the beginning of your timeline for completeness, but these are generally more predictable and quicker compared to other stages. I usually plan it separately, during the early stage of my initial planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Doâs:</strong> Whatever youâre doing as a project manager, make sure to get it approvedâmultiple times and by different people, depending on the stage of your project. Approve all business requirements and the desired future state of your project with your stakeholders, using design mockups for clarity. Review and approve technical documentation with your development teams and solution architects. If necessary, involve analytics and operations teams as well. Approve with legal department to be compliant. Always play it safeâget your plans approved before moving into implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nWhen the entire cycle of project documentation, planning, and approvals is completed, the only remaining step is implementation. And the better prepared you are, the smoother the process will be.</p>\n<p>\\\nBased on practice, at the very beginning, when I first start drafting project documentation, I donât focus too much on the format. Most of the time, in addition to using a notebook (which I still rely on heavily for handwriting and sketching), I use tools like Miro boards to create rough sketches, mind maps, and diagrams of systems and their interconnections. My initial notes might be somewhat chaotic, and thatâs okay.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/IkC3RJ0dhpfyCTOwCY6m6VlQz542-l9135us.jpeg\" alt=\"An example of the Miro board draft\" title=\"left-50\" /></p>\n<p>As I gather more knowledge, collect all requirements, and have discussions with the necessary teammates, the structure of the documentation naturally evolves. I refine it, organize it, and clean it up to make it ready for sharing with other teams.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor detailed guidance, you can refer to resources on creating project documentation directly within tools like Atlassianâs Confluence, which is widely used in the IT industry for both Project and Tech documentation. But just start to compile something, and it will evolve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3collaborate\">3. Collaborate</h2>\n<p>Remember, to deliver your project to production successfully and on time, youâre the \"three-in-one persona\" and the one in chargeâso take the lead. Be proactive and stick your nose into everything. Itâs on you to:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Go through and actually understand all the documentation thatâs already been created.</li>\n<li>Talk to different departments to make sure theyâre not going to be âdamagedâ by the update youâre working on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nSet up meetings to get the requirements you need. And widen your âadvisory boardâ: find the people who know all the âwhysâ behind the current solutionsâthose who can explain whatâs possible to change, whatâs not, and why. Understand your technical debt. Brainstorm with the teams to figure out the future state of the project.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Doâs:</strong> Donât be afraid of being annoying by asking a million questions. Itâs so much better to get everything clear before development starts than after. That said, do your homework first! Make sure youâve checked the existing documentation and havenât skipped over something you could Google yourself. When you do ask questions, show up preparedâyouâll get much better answers that way. But Iâm also not afraid to play dumb when needed. Sometimes, thatâs the only card that works!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"4simplify\">4. Simplify</h2>\n<p>Make things simple! If something feels too complicated, break it down into smaller, simpler parts. While the overall architecture of the project may indeed be complex, each individual component should be straightforward.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/IkC3RJ0dhpfyCTOwCY6m6VlQz542-rb73525.jpeg\" alt=\"Simplify everything possible \" title=\"right-50\" /></p>\n<p>If I canât explain something in simple terms, I take it as a sign that I donât fully understand it. This prompts me to dig deeper, gain clarity, and develop the ability to explain it in clear, straightforward language, often with examples.</p>\n<p>\\\nSometimes, you might inherit a project with overly complex logic that takes ages to comprehend. In 99.9% of cases, thereâs room for simplification. This is often because the way people think varies, and some tend to overcomplicate things due to their natural inclination toward complexity. Most of the time, with âmy iterationâ I rebuild such projects in a much more straightforward and efficient way. Thereâs always a way to simplify things, largely because Iâve trained myself to approach problems with simplicity in mind.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>==So, develop the habit of simplifying.==</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"5practice\">5. Practice</h2>\n<p>You can read hundreds of articles on how to be a successful project manager, but nothing can replace real-life experience. Just do it!</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fail or succeed â Learn â Repeat</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nDonât be afraid to make mistakes in the beginning. Learn from your experiences. Practice, and continue gaining new knowledge along the way. All it takes is for you to start. If youâre truly determined, youâll figure it outâsooner or later, faster or slowerâbut you absolutely will.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd in case youâre just starting your journey and need some mentorship or advice, feel free to reach out to me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaromirova/?ref=hackernoon.com\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The fall of EV startup Fisker: A comprehensive timeline","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/the-fall-of-ev-startup-fisker-a-comprehensive-timeline/","date":1735234920,"author":"Henry Pickavet, Sean O'Kane","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Here is a timeline of the events that led fledgling automaker Fisker to file for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Â© 2024 TechCrunch.

By enabling data processing to occur closer to its source, this approach minimizes dependence on centralized data centers. The result is faster processing speeds, reduced latency, and enhanced securityâqualities that are indispensable for AI and ML, where real-time data analysis and response are critical.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt the forefront of this revolution is Ishan Bhatt, whose innovative work with Google Distributed Cloud Connected addresses the complex challenges of implementing edge computing for AI and ML workloads. Ishanâs solutions deliver the low-latency, high-performance networking essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles and advanced healthcare technologies.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy focusing on optimizing network performance and achieving seamless cloud integration, Ishan is redefining standards for efficiency and innovation in this dynamic and rapidly advancing domain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crackingthelowlatencycode\"><strong>Cracking the low-latency code</strong></h3>\n<p>Developing low-latency, high-performance networking solutions for edge deployments comes with significant challenges, as Ishan explains. One of the primary hurdles lies in the limited computational and energy resources at the edge. To address this, Ishan notes, âIt is crucial to optimize software and protocols to minimize resource usage while also leveraging advanced hardware accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs to offload tasks efficiently.â Additionally, he employs dynamic power management techniques to maintain a balance between energy consumption and system performance.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnother critical challenge is achieving the ultra-low latency required for edge applications. Ishan emphasizes the importance of strategies such as edge caching and data prefetching, which reduce the need for remote data retrieval, and advanced routing algorithms to ensure data transmission via the shortest possible paths. To manage unpredictable workloads and maintain scalability across distributed nodes, Ishan highlights the need for adaptive traffic management systems that allocate bandwidth dynamically based on real-time demand and microservice-based deployments for flexible scaling. These carefully integrated approaches reflect his commitment to addressing the unique demands of edge networking with precision and innovation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"networkingforedgeai\"><strong>Networking for edge AI</strong></h3>\n<p>Supporting AI and ML workloads at the edge demands a unique set of networking requirements to handle their high complexity and resource demands. Ishan highlights the necessity for high-bandwidth networking to handle the volume efficiently, especially when processing large datasets such as video streams or real-time telemetry. Unlike traditional networks, which prioritize general-purpose data transfer, edge AI solutions require robust throughput to prevent bottlenecks in the processing pipeline.</p>\n<p>\\\nUltra-low latency is another critical factor, as many AI tasks, including real-time object detection and autonomous decision-making, rely on instantaneous responses. Ishan explains, âEdge AI systems must minimize latency to support these time-sensitive operations,\" whereas traditional networks can tolerate delays typical of batch-processing tasks. Additionally, AI at the edge benefits from distributed architectures that decentralize processing, enabling localized data handling and coordination among geographically dispersed nodes. Ishan contrasts this with traditional systems, which typically centralize processing in data centers, making them less suited for the decentralized nature of edge AI. Tailoring networks to these unique demands is essential to unlocking the full potential of AI and ML at the edge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acceleratingperformanceinedgecomputing\"><strong>Accelerating performance in edge computing</strong></h3>\n<p>Achieving low-latency performance in edge deployments requires a combination of advanced strategies and innovative technologies, as outlined by Ishan. A key approach involves bringing computation closer to data sources. Ishan explains, \"Deploy compute resources at the network edge to handle time-sensitive tasks locally,\" minimizing the distance data must travel and reducing reliance on centralized servers through localized caching. To further optimize speed, he recommends modernizing communication protocols, such as replacing traditional TCP with alternatives like QUIC or RDMA, which reduce overhead and improve efficiency for specific use cases.</p>\n<p>\\\nDynamic traffic management also plays a crucial role. Ishan utilizes software-defined networking (SDN) to \"dynamically optimize traffic routing and resource allocation,\" ensuring latency-sensitive tasks receive priority. Similarly, network function virtualization (NFV) replaces hardware-based network appliances with virtualized functions, bringing critical processes closer to the edge and reducing delays. Advanced hardware, such as FPGA and ASIC accelerators, combined with intelligent routing algorithms and real-time congestion control mechanisms, ensures data flows along the most efficient paths. These techniques, paired with continuous latency monitoring and hybrid edge-cloud architectures, enable networks to meet the rigorous demands of AI, IoT, and other real-time applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scalingedgeintelligence\"><strong>Scaling edge intelligence</strong></h3>\n<p>Scalability in edge networks, especially for AI and ML applications, demands innovative design and strategic resource management. Ishan emphasizes the importance of modular architectures, stating, âThey allow seamless addition of edge nodes or components as demand grows.\" This approach relies on microservices for specific network functions, distributed edge infrastructures to reduce bottlenecks, and hierarchical edge tiers to balance workloads effectively across layers.</p>\n<p>\\\nDynamic resource allocation also plays a critical role in scaling efficiently. Ishan points out the value of using containerized environments like Kubernetes, which can dynamically orchestrate workloads across edge nodes and implement auto-scaling to adjust resources in real time. Additionally, AI-specific strategies such as federated learning frameworks enable distributed processing across edge nodes, reducing reliance on centralized training. By integrating advanced technologies like Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and leveraging high-performance hardware such as TPUs and FPGAs, Ishan ensures scalability without compromising the performance, adaptability, or reliability of edge networks designed to meet the increasing demands of AI and ML workloads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automationinaction\"><strong>Automation in action</strong></h3>\n<p>Automation is a cornerstone of efficient edge network deployment, as Ishanâs experience with Google Distributed Cloud Connected demonstrates. By employing the widely used gcloud API, Ishan ensures that edge device configurations are automated to maintain consistency across large-scale deployments. âIt reduces manual errors and accelerates setup from days to hours,â Ishan explains, emphasizing the tangible improvements in speed and accuracy. This approach also abstracts complex technical details, making the deployment process more user-friendly and streamlined.</p>\n<p>\\\nIshan envisions automation evolving further as it integrates with advanced technologies and trends. âAI and ML enhance network management by predicting traffic patterns, automating fault detection, and optimizing resource allocation,â he notes, underscoring the role of AI-powered automation in shaping next-generation networks. Tools like digital twins, which simulate and optimize network performance, and AI-driven anomaly detection are set to strengthen security and operational efficiency in increasingly complex environments.</p>\n<p>\\\nEmerging trends such as federated learning and quantum networking will also benefit from automation. Ishan highlights the need to design networks that facilitate federated learning for distributed AI processing while integrating quantum networking for unparalleled security and speed. These advancements, paired with automation, will enable networks to handle the growing demands of AI and edge workloads while maintaining scalability and adaptability.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis forward-looking integration of automation with innovations in hardware and sustainability reflects Ishanâs commitment to driving impactful advancements. Implementing energy-saving algorithms and hardware optimizations for AI workloads is a key focus, aligning operational efficiency with environmental responsibility. Ishanâs vision ensures that edge networks remain agile, secure, and ready for future demands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"realworldimpact\"><strong>Real-world impact</strong></h3>\n<p>The integration of AI and ML at the edge is revolutionizing real-world applications by enabling faster, more secure, and efficient processing of data. Ishan explains that edge AI systems eliminate the need to send data to the cloud, significantly reducing latency. \"AI-driven healthcare devices at hospitals detect irregular heart rhythms and alert doctors within milliseconds, potentially saving lives,\" Ishan highlights, demonstrating the life-saving potential of localized decision-making. Additionally, this approach enhances privacy and security by minimizing the transmission of sensitive data, as seen in facial recognition systems at airports that process images locally while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.</p>\n<p>\\\nEffective network design underpins these advancements by ensuring low-latency communication and dynamic resource allocation. Ishan points out, \"Networks with automated resource scaling ensure efficient handling of fluctuating AI/ML workloads,\" which is critical during peak demand periods, such as in e-commerce for AI-driven recommendation systems. Moreover, distributed architectures improve resilience, enabling systems like industrial IoT to maintain operations even during disruptions. Ishan underscores the broader impact of these designs, stating that optimized networks reduce energy consumption and operational costs, making edge AI more sustainable. These innovations not only enhance current applications but also set the stage for continuous innovation across industries.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs networking solutions continue to progress, Ishanâs leadership serves as a guiding light.

It is a naÃ¯ve ask.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, let us make an agenda (because we bother). Even in our educated agenda, the divide of efforts and reason, and of reason for execution, is substantial:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The amateurish.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strong capitals of intelligence, resource, and networks, armed agendas with shareholder objectives.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Firstly, enjoin me to a definition: amateur.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe amateur engages in an activity for pleasure rather than as a profession or for financial gain. That is in no way a proclamation of a virtuous high ground â in fact, it is only circumstances that have nudged me to my position â I would not necessarily have chosen it.</p>\n<p>\\\nHow does the citizen of a failing economy survive? what do they do when they have no control over the bigger picture? I am not an economist, nor a politically literate individual, but I am an engineer who have Identified a rather non problematic fix for the individual experience, and leaving the macroeconomic schematics to those who bother. The citizens of Nigeria are in trouble. The naira (the Nigerian currency) kept losing its value each day to inflation, so much it was disorienting. Just so you understand â if you earned one naira every single day, for four years straight, you still would not make a dollar.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6SmKD9YTi8b2HqzaEVy2WeHHv7p2-qe334wy.gif.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>It would be odd for the average citizen in an economy as that to stand non-disoriented â much beyond acquainted with it. The federal minimum wage remains less than 50 dollars a month â that is largely unsubstantial. Poverty increases; the wealth divide grows larger.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere was a lot to pack in, most of it another tragedy â but one thing is understood by anyone who sleeps with the intent to wake:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You either make more money,</p></li>\n<li><p>Or make the most of any you control.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The former certainly is most appealing, but not very reachable for most, for obvious reasons. The latter? We can work with that. The question for me was, how do I make the most out of the money I have, while I try navigating the crisis of expenditure, and the hard work of earning more. To do this, I had to get back to my priority list, but this time, with a gun to my head.</p>\n<p>\\\nDid I really have to buy the fifth snack for the day? No.</p>\n<p>Did I really have to cook my noodles with four eggs? No.</p>\n<p>Did I really have to lend my roommate cash whenever he asked for it? No.</p>\n<p>Did I really have to eat my oatmeal with that much milk? No.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6SmKD9YTi8b2HqzaEVy2WeHHv7p2-rt434oc.gif.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>As It turns out, when you are under pressure, there is a place where you could see quite clearly. Now, what do I do? It was true I did not need any more motivation to cut back on the spending, but heavens know it is all easier said than done. If I had a way of simply not having access to the money I would very much not like to waste. I am a software engineer, so getting the idea for an app was most natural, as I knew what could be done. Sadly, I could not find any existing apps doing this, so I was not getting a save. But I could do it for others. And I did ask â had a conversation with a couple of friends of mine, and they concurred on a relevance.</p>\n<p>\\\nGet acquainted with MyPursePay, a fintech app that allows users to schedule their money into days, weeks, or months â enabling them to lock it, and only allowing them to spend the amount they set on the event of the schedule they made.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo put that into perspective, if you had 30 dollars to spend for 30 days (a month) on transportation, and it cost a dollar a day for a bus ride, to ensure you never end up running out of money for that, due to unexpected expenses or casual spontaneous purchases, you can schedule a dollar a day on the MyPurse app. Every morning, a dollar is released to you for your bus ride, while the rest of the money remains inaccessible to you until the next day.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6SmKD9YTi8b2HqzaEVy2WeHHv7p2-nd634m4.gif.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe Nigerian citizens are widely digitally engaged, so there will be no usability or entry barriers. As for the idea, it will have to prove itself. The bureaucracies, political jargon, and unempathetic details on why the economy has fallen in ruins will elude the layman. They cannot control what they do not know, and have no power over. Words do not mean much in Nigeria, not on any level that concerns the ideals of democracy. What the citizen can do is adapt, and survive.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, for your considerations, I am the subject of definition : the amateur. I have come to see my enterprise find an entanglement with empathy for the well-being of the common citizen. I am Nigerian anyways, and what is any man without the will to serve his homeland? But this enterprise is young â it is inexperienced and, naturally, challenged. But it will give its best regardless. Because that is what survivors do.</p>\n<p>\\\nCheers,</p>\n<p><strong>Leon</strong></p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The High Cost of Training Data in NLP Projects","url":"https://hackernoon.com/the-high-cost-of-training-data-in-nlp-projects?source=rss","date":1735231515,"author":"Text Mining","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Atw2lXsJWRm7osebJVC4\">Abstract and Introduction</a></strong> </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Domain and Task</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/gvqItA7L7XcwOscgpVRv\">2.1.

The cost of training data</h2>\n<p>In the project, we used a mixture of supervised and unsupervised (rules) methods. There are many practical reasons for this choice, but contrary to the scientific literature that is predominantly based on supervised machine learning methods (Suganthan et al., 2015), the main reasons for not opting for a fully supervised approach is the cost. This may be explained from many factors, such as the human labour, the time required, the number (and complexity) of tasks to be addressed, and the tools needed for developing the training data.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe project uses a process that involves multiple tasks of varying complexity. Developing training data for the two zoning tasks is relatively low-cost, as they do not require specialist tools to support the annotation process. In both tasks, annotators were given the extracted text passages either in raw text or CSV (for tables only), together with the original document for reference. The annotation task is also fairly easy, as it only requires skimming through these documents, and does not require extensive reading. In contrast, annotating lot items (lot item detection) and their specific attributes (lot parsing) are much lower granularity tasks, and require examining content at sentence or phrase level. The data also needs to be transformed into formats that can be loaded into state of the art annotation tools that are not always available for our data format. For example, the widely used âspacyNERâ annotation format requires parallel sequences of tokens and their labels for each sentence. Such data is very expensive to develop from a business perspective.</p>\n<p>\\\nFurther, as already raised in earlier studies, industrial solutions often favour rules over supervised models as the latter offers easier interpretability and maintainability. These are crucial factors as the needs for their applications can evolve over time and therefore, the solutions must be easy to modify over time. In these cases, changing rules may be a much lighter effort than recreating training data and retraining the system. For these reasons, training data for supervised models can be a barrier to the adoption of methods developed in the research communities, when it comes to developing industrial applications.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Ziqi Zhang*, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Ziqi.Zhang@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(2) Tomas Jasaitis, Vamstar Ltd., London (Tomas.Jasaitis@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(3) Richard Freeman, Vamstar Ltd., London (Richard.Freeman@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(4) Rowida Alfrjani, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Rowida.Alfrjani@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(5) Adam Funk, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Adam.Funk@sheffield.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03458\">available on arxiv</a></strong> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Why Classic Algorithms Still Matter in Modern Natural Language Processing","url":"https://hackernoon.com/why-classic-algorithms-still-matter-in-modern-natural-language-processing?source=rss","date":1735230618,"author":"Text Mining","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Atw2lXsJWRm7osebJVC4\">Abstract and Introduction</a></strong> </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Domain and Task</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/gvqItA7L7XcwOscgpVRv\">2.1.

The dilemma of algorithmic choices</h2>\n<p>Our classification method is based on âclassicâ machine learning algorithms and does not utilise the more recent deep neural networks trained on very large datasets as âlanguage modelsâ, such as the well known BERT (Delvin et al., 2018). These models have been shown to set new benchmarks for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, we did not use BERT or similar language model based methods for a number of practical reasons.</p>\n<p>\\\nFirst, such models work in slightly different ways from classic algorithms in the sense that they take over the feature extraction process through a âtext readingâ process analogous to humans. The idea is that through training such models using enormous data, they are expected to have a certain level of âunderstandingâ of human language, and therefore, can learn to automatically extract useful features from the input texts. This makes feature engineering not very compatible with such models, although one can still run such models as a âfeature extractorâ to generate a feature representation vector, and combine it with other predefined features.</p>\n<p>\\\nSecond, such models are usually very resource intensive due to its complex architecture and the amount of data used to train them. As a result, they usually can only take a limited length of text. Popular options are a length of 256 or 512 tokens, with the second typically requiring significantly higher computing resources. This means that some of our tasks, such as page or table classification, may not fit well when the content is longer than this length, particularly the smaller option which is more affordable.</p>\n<p>\\\nThird, we experimented with a generic BERT model (English uncased, 256) on the lot item detection task using English training data only, and compared its performance against our best performing model, random forest. However, we did not notice significant gain in F1 by BERT (under 2 percentage points). We assume that a potential reason is that the generic BERT model is trained on general purpose corpus that may not be closely related to healthcare. Studies (Alsentzer et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2019) have shown that usually, language models need to be further trained using domain specific corpora when they are to be applied to domain specific contexts. This again requires significant data and computing resources, especially when we have to deal with multiple languages.</p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, the next lesson we learned is that for industry projects, practicality is an important factor when it comes to choosing the methods. Resource constraints often outweigh algorithmic superiority, especially if the performance gain is small given the potential resource investment needed.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Ziqi Zhang*, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Ziqi.Zhang@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(2) Tomas Jasaitis, Vamstar Ltd., London (Tomas.Jasaitis@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(3) Richard Freeman, Vamstar Ltd., London (Richard.Freeman@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(4) Rowida Alfrjani, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Rowida.Alfrjani@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(5) Adam Funk, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Adam.Funk@sheffield.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03458\">available on arxiv</a></strong> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Performance Benefits Of Linux 6.12 LTS Over Linux 6.6 LTS","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-66-612-lts","date":1735230600,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Linux 6.12 was recently promoted to being this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel with it being the last major kernel release of 2024.

Honeypots were designed traditionally as a form of protection from intelligent, human adversaries - specifically. I made a point to keep an eye on the change in defensive security as it grows to protect systems from intelligence with a computational cortex. To better understand this important cybersecurity practice, here is the history, foundational thinking, and the state of the art of what Honeypots look like today.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Introduction: The Honey Trap Throughout History</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe concept of the honeypot, both as a literal object and a metaphor, has a long history rooted in deception. The term conjures imagery of sweet, irresistible bait, deliberately placed to attract and ensnare an adversarial actor. In cybersecurity, honeypots are systems or environments designed to lure attackers, offering them what appears to be valuable data or access. But the roots of the honeypot idea go much deeper than digital security.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe origins of deception as a defensive strategy are ancient. Military forces used decoys to mislead enemies, such as wooden fortifications or dummy armies meant to draw fire or resources away from real targets. Espionage also has its own version of the honeypot: operatives trained to seduce and compromise adversaries, baiting them into revealing secrets or making strategic errors.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen computing entered the picture, the honeypot concept naturally transitioned into digital security. In 1989, Gene Spafford introduced active defence strategies that included deception, marking a turning point in how organisations thought about cybersecurity (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07194\">Cyber Deception: State of the Art, Trends, and Open Challenges</a>). By the 1990s, tools like Fred Cohenâs <a href=\"http://all.net/dtk/\">Deception Toolkit (DTK)</a> and the Honeynet Project formally brought the idea into practice. These early digital honeypots were static and straightforward, but they laid the groundwork for an entirely new approach to defence: luring attackers in to learn from their behavior, rather than merely keeping them out.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Cyber Deception in the Digital Age</strong></p>\n<p>Today, honeypots are part of a broader strategy known as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324117795_Cyber_Deception_Overview_and_the_Road_Ahead\">Cyber Deception (CYDEC)</a>. CYDEC uses deliberate misdirection to confuse attackers, increasing the cost of their operations while gathering valuable intelligence. Unlike firewalls or intrusion detection systems, which are designed to block or alert, honeypots serve as active tools for studying adversaries, learning their methods, and even deterring future attacks by introducing uncertainty into their efforts.</p>\n<p>\\\nModern honeypots align with CYDEC taxonomies, which categorise strategies across five layers: strategy (offensive or defensive), dimension (data, system, network), phase (prevention, detection, response), tactics (e.g., decoying), and techniques (e.g., honeypots, obfuscation). Honeypots excel as decoys, creating believable but fabricated environments that attackers cannot resist targeting, itâs really worth reviewing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07194\">Cyber Deception: State of the Art, Trends, and Open Challenges</a> to understand this.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>The Evolution of Honeypots</strong></p>\n<p>The static honeypots of the past were relatively simpleâdesigned to mimic services like SSH or FTP servers, they recorded basic interactions to analyse what attackers were doing. These honeypots worked well for catching opportunistic hackers, but they struggled against more sophisticated adversaries. Modern honeypots, by contrast, are dynamic and intelligent, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to engage with attackers in realistic, adaptive ways. Here are some of the most significant advancements:</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>1. HoneyGPT: Bringing AI to the Frontline</strong> HoneyGPT represents a leap forward in honeypot technology. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, HoneyGPT can engage attackers in detailed, human-like interactions. Using structured prompt engineering, it sustains conversations, creating an illusion of authentic engagement. This approach helps defenders gather critical insights into attacker behavior, tactics, and objectives (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01882\">HoneyGPT</a>).</p>\n<p>\\\nThe brilliance of HoneyGPT lies in its ability to mimic real users or system administrators. For instance, an attacker probing a customer service chatbot may unwittingly interact with a honeypot, revealing phishing techniques or other exploits in the process. The intelligence gathered is invaluable for preempting similar attacks elsewhere. However, HoneyGPT is not without limitationsâits effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of its prompts and its capacity to handle unstructured or unexpected inputs.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>2. LLM Honeypot: Proactive Cyber Defence</strong> The LLM Honeypot takes the concept of AI-driven honeypots further by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on datasets of known attacker behavior. This enables the honeypot to predict and adapt to adversarial tactics in real-time, shifting from reactive to proactive defence (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08234\">LLM Honeypot</a>).</p>\n<p>\\\nFor example, imagine a decoy administrative interface that not only responds to attacker queries but intelligently adjusts its behavior to prolong interaction and gather more data. While this approach has tremendous potential, it requires access to vast, high-quality datasets and substantial computational resources, making it less accessible to smaller organisations.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>3. HoneyDOC: Modular and Scalable Deception</strong> HoneyDOC introduces modularity to honeypot design, dividing it into Decoy, Captor, and Orchestrator components. This allows for tailored deployment in diverse environments, from enterprise networks to IoT systems (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06516\">HoneyDOC</a>).</p>\n<p>\\\nThis modularity is a game-changer, enabling organisations to build honeypots specific to their needs. For example, a healthcare provider could create a decoy electronic health record (EHR) system, while a manufacturing firm might mimic an IoT-enabled factory floor. However, deploying such systems in highly dynamic environments can pose integration and latency challenges.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>4. Industrial Honeypots: Protecting Critical Infrastructure</strong> Industrial honeypots focus on operational technology (OT), replicating environments like power grids, water treatment plants, and manufacturing systems. By mimicking complex industrial protocols, they provide a unique defence against adversaries targeting critical infrastructure. A notable example uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to emulate industrial processes in real time, creating convincing decoys for attackers (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21574\">Industrial Systems Honeypot</a>).</p>\n<p>\\\nThese honeypots address a critical need, as OT environments are often poorly secured and highly targeted. However, they require precise modeling of industrial systems to be effective, which can be a significant barrier.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>5. Blockchain and IoT Honeypots: Securing the Edge</strong> Emerging technologies like blockchain and IoT come with unique vulnerabilities. Honeypots designed for these environments leverage decentralised systems and smart contracts to deploy decoys dynamically across IoT networks. For instance, a fake blockchain node can attract attackers trying to exploit weaknesses in transaction validation (<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595866\">Blockchain IoT Honeypot</a>).</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile these systems are highly effective in addressing niche vulnerabilities, they can introduce computational overhead and may be less effective against adversaries familiar with blockchain and IoT environments.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>The Challenges Ahead</strong></p>\n<p>Despite their advancements, honeypots face significant challenges that are faced by all evolving AI systems:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Creating and maintaining realistic decoys across large networks remains a technical hurdle.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>AI Evolution</strong>: While AI-powered honeypots are promising, attackers are also using AI to identify and bypass decoys.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dynamic Threats</strong>: As attackers become more sophisticated, honeypots must continually innovate to remain effective.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Future research must address these challenges, particularly through automation and the integration of cutting-edge AI models. There are certainly more examples than those above, but Iâm calling attention to those I want to call attention to, and leaving out those that are so good I donât want adversarial actors to have a heads up. This is not a recreational architecture to stand up on your own personal architectures. <em>This article is for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)\">White Hats</a>, exclusively.</em> Thereâs very good regulatory reasons for this:</p>\n<h4 id=\"thechallengesofdeployinghoneypots\"><strong>The Challenges of Deploying Honeypots</strong></h4>\n<p>While honeypots provide invaluable insights and defence capabilities, their deployment must be approached with caution to avoid legal, ethical, and operational pitfalls. By addressing these challenges through careful planning and legal consultation, organisations can deploy honeypots effectively while minimising risks:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Honeypots often collect attacker data, including potentially identifiable information. In jurisdictions like the European Union, where IP addresses are classified as personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this can create compliance risks. Organisations must ensure their honeypots are configured to handle data ethically and within legal frameworks. <em>Yes, even your adversarial attacker is probably GDPR protected (</em><a href=\"https://jis-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13635-017-0057-4\">Honeypots and Honeynets: Issues of Privacy</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Liability Risks</strong>: If a honeypot is compromised and used to launch attacks on other systems, the organisation deploying it could face liability for damages. Robust security measures must be in place to prevent such misuse (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19419-6_9\">Deploying Honeypots and Honeynets: Issues of Liability</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Entrapment Issues</strong>: While primarily a legal concern for law enforcement, the concept of entrapmentâinducing someone to commit a crime they otherwise wouldnâtâis important to consider. Honeypots should passively observe and analyse attacker behavior rather than actively encouraging illegal actions (<a href=\"https://www.sans.org/white-papers/1746/\">CyberLaw 101: A primer on US laws related to honeypot deployments</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Jurisdictional Challenges</strong>: Cyber activities often cross international borders, complicating enforcement and compliance. For example, data collected in one country may be subject to the privacy laws of another, creating legal grey areas (<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-05-legal-ramifications-anti-hacker-honeypots.html\">Legal ramifications of anti-hacker honeypots</a>).</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: The Enduring Sweetness of Honeypots</strong></p>\n<p>Honeypots have transformed from simple traps into dynamic tools that play a critical role in modern cybersecurity. By integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and modular architectures, they remain indispensable in the fight against evolving cyber threats. Whether protecting critical infrastructure, defending IoT systems, or engaging adversaries in deceptive conversations, honeypots prove that the best defence often lies in strategic deception. As cybersecurity threats grow more sophisticated, the relevance of honeypots has only increased. Their ability to adapt, deceive, and gather intel will improve - as will the regulatory constraints of this evolving security practice, with ancient historical roots.</p>\n<p>\\\nAbsolutely yes, honeypots not only matter in the modern digital world â they are now <strong><em>sweeter than ever</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/RHANbxrXjsYoxIMTyKJFleCFJyC3-1d034cd.jpeg\" alt=\"Pyramid Honey: https://xkcd.com/1717/\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Unpacking The Starknet Bolt Upgrade","url":"https://hackernoon.com/unpacking-the-starknet-bolt-upgrade?source=rss","date":1735228818,"author":"2077 Research","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>\\\nStarknetâs latest upgrade (v0.13.2) named <strong>Bolt</strong> brings two major changes: <strong>parallel execution</strong> and <strong>block-packing</strong>. Although independent of one another, both features support the push towards the goal of fast, cheap blockspace cryptographically secured by Ethereum.</p>\n<p>\\\nParallel execution allows non-contentious transactions (i.e., transactions that donât touch the same state) to execute concurrently. By implementing parallel execution, L2s like Starknet can reduce execution time without increasing resource usage. This means lower transaction fees for users and significantly improved transaction confirmation times.</p>\n<p>\\\nBlock packing optimizes Starknetâs usage of blobspace on Ethereum L1: with block packing, sequencers can generate one proof to verify multiple Starknet L2 blocks simultaneously. This decouples usage of blobspace from the frequency of L2 block production and amortizes proof verification costs. Both reduce operating costs for the Starknet sequencer, which means users pay less per transaction.</p>\n<p>\\\nLike we said, Bolt makes Starknet cheaper and faster! This report will provide a detailed analysis of the Bolt upgradeâfocusing on parallel execution and block packingâand explore the implications for Starknetâs performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aquickrefresheronrollups\">A quick refresher on rollups</h2>\n<p>Rollups are <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/the-practical-guide-to-ethereum-rollups\">layer two (L2) scaling solutions</a> that aim to scale the underlying layer one (L1) blockchain by moving computation off-chain. By moving execution off-chain, rollups can optimize for scalability (cheap and fast transactions), while the L1 provides security for L2 transactions.</p>\n<p>\\\nRollups are often said to âinherit security from the L1â. What this essentially means is that they inherit the consensus and data availability guarantees provided by the L1. In addition to this, the L1 also provides a security guarantee in the form of secure bridging between it and the rollup.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen sequencers publish L2 blocks to the L1, the L1 provides guarantees of the availability as well as the ordering of this information. From here, L2 nodes can trustlessly compute the canonical L2 chain with this information along with the rollupâs rules around chain derivation and state transition described by the node implementation.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn order to facilitate secure bridging between the L1 and the L2, the L1 requires proof that the L2 chain it is currently following is correct and does not include illegal state changes (e.g. double spend). This need for rollups to prove the validity of state changes, ensures the L1 does not authorize withdrawals from the rollup based on illegal state.</p>\n<p>\\\nRollups differ based on how they prove validity of state changes to the L1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validity rollups rely on <strong>validity proofs</strong> to objectively verify correctness of execution. Proposers are allowed to propose a new rollup state if they submit a validity proof to the rollup contract.</li>\n<li>Optimistic rollups rely on the absence of a <strong>fraud proof</strong> to subjectively verify correctness of execution. Proposers submit state updates without proofs, but the rollup contract can roll back any state update whose validity is successfully challenged by a fraud proof.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nRollups also provide the base layer with enough data for interested parties to reconstruct the L2 state. While optimistic rollups must publish full transaction data to enable challengers to compute fraud proofs, validity rollups have no such requirements (validity proofs guarantee correct execution). But posting full transaction data on L1 is still useful from a trust-minimization perspective (trustless reconstruction of state and permissionless withdrawals).</p>\n<p>\\\nStarknet is a validity rollup that uses <strong>S</strong>calable, <strong>T</strong>ransparent <strong>AR</strong>gument of <strong>K</strong>nowledge (STARKs) to prove the validity of state changes. The latest upgrade to Starknetâcodenamed Boltâadds parallel execution and block packing. In subsequent sections, weâll explain how the two features work and what improvements they bring for Starknet users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdidthestarknetboltupgradechange\">What did the Starknet Bolt upgrade change?</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the Bolt upgrade changed Starknetâs execution, proving and <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/data-availability-or-how-rollups-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-ethereum\">data availability</a> mechanisms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optimizingexecution\">Optimizing execution</h3>\n<p>Before the Bolt upgrade, Starknet transactions were executed sequentiallyâone after the otherâby the sequencer. Sequential execution is simple but also very inefficient. Itâs inefficient because it does not take advantage of the multiple independent processing units that modern day computers offer and the parallelizability of a set of transactions.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:15.458Z-xvu6exe7ir9ty5yth0rx9dac\" alt=\"Sequential Execution\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:15.508Z-fr9t0x0ba0lysizcduhbhyn4\" alt=\"Parallel execution\" /></p>\n<p>Parallelizability is a measure of how independent the transactions in a given set are. For example, consider the set of three transactions below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Transaction 1: Alice wants to send Bob 1 STRK</p></li>\n<li><p>Transaction 2: Caitlyn wants to send Danny 100 ETH</p></li>\n<li><p>Transaction 3: Caitlyn wants to send Ella 100 ETH</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:15.510Z-lhg1p6y9mm4o6mod2ookg7rx\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Transaction 1 is completely independent of transactions 2 and 3âbecause it is accessing a different part of the state (Aliceâs balance)âand can be executed concurrently. However, transaction 2 and 3 are conflicting because they want to access the same stateâCaitlynâs ETH balance. These transactions can not be executed concurrently or weâll end up with conflicting results.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo illustrate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say Caitlynâs balance is 300 ETH and transactions 2 and 3 start at the same time. Both transactions will read the initial balance of Caitlynâs account as 300 ETH, deduct the transfer amount from it (300 - 100 = 200), and write 200 ETH to the location in memory where Caitlynâs account balance is stored.</li>\n<li>Transactions 2 and 3 will then read Danny and Ellaâs balances respectively and add 100 ETH to both usersâ balances. Caitlynâs balance would reduce by 100 ETH, but 200 ETH would be creditedâeffectively printing 100 ETH out of thin air.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nAvoiding these types of conflicts (and the complex nature of mitigation mechanisms) is why Ethereum chose sequential execution. However, while sequential execution reduces complexity and improves security, it results in inefficient use of hardware. Worse still, the trend of hardware design suggests sequential execution will become increasingly inefficient in the coming years.</p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 4 shows the trend of hardware design in the last 50 years. The relevant takeaway? Single-thread performance (purple circles) has been plateauing since the mid 2000s while the number of logical cores has increased around the same time. We can make two conclusions based on this data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hardware designers are scaling computer chips by adding more independent processing units rather than improving the performance of a single unit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Any system that continues to rely on increased performance of a single processing unit will experience a stall in performance gains even on newer hardware.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:15.512Z-gqlbm9k7jp7zr7gggghp3inm\" alt=\"Figure 4: Microprocessor trends\" /></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nIn recent years, sophisticated algorithms for managing transaction conflicts and ensuring correctness of parallel execution have appeared. Block-STM (based on a paper by Fikunmi et al*) is one such algorithm and forms the core part of Starknetâs new parallel execution engine.&nbsp; We analyze the Block-STM algorithm in later sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optimizingprovinganddataavailability\"><strong>Optimizing proving and data availability</strong></h3>\n<p>Starknetâs SHARP (short for Shared Prover) has always taken advantage of recursive proofs to reduce verification costs as much as possible. A recursive proof is essentially a âproof of proofâ where one proof verifies that one or more proofs are correct. Below is a sketch of how SHARP generates a recursive proof:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The SHARP system takes a set of programs to be executed (a âjobâ) as input and generates a proof of execution for the job. These âprogramsâ are L2 blocks and the proof attests to correctness of transactions.</p></li>\n<li><p>The proof is sent to another program that verifies the proof and converts the proof verification program into a job. SHARP takes the new job as input and generates another proof (this proof confirms the validity of the previous proof).</p></li>\n<li><p>The process (proof â job â proof) restarts and continues until a target is reached at which point the final proof (which is now a highly compressed version of the original proof) is posted to the L1</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.671Z-eo0qw1nvie0bora3tavdenvd\" alt=\"Figure 5: Recursive proof generation\" /></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThis design greatly amortizes costs for two major reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The subsequent jobs* are not individual programs or transactions and proving costs grow sub-linearly. This means the larger the number of programs/transactions within a job, the greater the savings. By creating proofs per block instead of per transaction, transaction fees can be much cheaper.</li>\n<li>Recursion greatly compresses the proofs resulting in a âproof of proofâ that is significantly cheaper to verify on the L1 than the initial proof or any of the intermediate proofs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nWhile the proving system was good, there were missed chances to further save costs. For example, each job was a single Starknet block and each of these blocks were designed to take up one blob on the L1. This resulted in certain inefficiencies as described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior to Bolt, Starknet did (and still does) not have regular blocktimes; instead an L2 block was published to the L1 under two conditions: (1) One blobâs worth of data was executed (2) Six minutes had elapsed from the previous block. Unfortunately, due to demand, most of the blocks were sent to the L1 because of the six minute limit (not DA limits).</li>\n<li>The above meant that blobs (not blocks) were often (severely) underutilized, resulting in unnecessarily high gas costs. Starknet blocks also had a <a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/upcoming-feature-starknet-applicative-recursion/113868#:~:text=Present%20and%20future-,Present,-We%20start%20off\">fixed cost</a>, which could theoretically be reduced by applying the same recursion techniques discussed above to produce proofs of multiple blocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nBlock packing tackles these problems by using a binary tree of recursive proofs. We discuss block packing in a later section of the article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"boltpart1parallelexecution\">Bolt Part 1: Parallel Execution</h2>\n<p>As discussed earlier, sequential execution is inefficient (and will only be more inefficient as time goes on) and naive parallel execution produces invalid results. Production parallel execution engines take care to prevent inconsistent results, however.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are two approaches to tackling parallel execution: <strong>Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)</strong> and <strong>Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)</strong>. PCC and OCC are transaction processing units (TPUs). Below is a definition of a transaction processing unit from <strong><a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/block-stm_vs_sealevel\">Block-STM vs. SVM: A Comparison of Parallel Execution Engines:</a></strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The TPU is usually coupled with, but distinct from the Virtual Machine (VM). Blockchain VMs like the EVM, SVM, and MoveVM are high-level language VMsâ¦The TPU, which is usually the subject of interest, subsumes the VM. It is tasked with the management of the entire transaction execution pipeline, including creating and managing instances of the VM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nPessimistic concurrency control is designed based on the assumption that many of the transactions within the set of transactions to be executed will conflict, i.e., they will touch the same state. PCC&nbsp; <strong>prevents</strong> these conflicts.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo prevent conflicts, PCC requires that a transaction declare upfront what portions of state it will access during read/write operations. The transaction processing unit can use this information to schedule transactions in a way that ensures that conflicting transactions are executed sequentially (instead of concurrently). Some TPUs also use locks to enforce this behavior (a lock (a.k.a., mutex) is a mechanism used to prevent concurrent access to a memory location).</p>\n<p>\\\nThat said, PCC-based execution incurs certain tradeoffs. First, the requirement to provide access lists (which identify the memory slot a transaction touches) degrades the developer experience and reduces the range of possible applications. Second, scheduling transactions can incur unnecessary overheadâespecially when there are no conflicts.</p>\n<p>\\\nOptimistic concurrency control is designed with the assumption that many of the transactions within the given set will not conflict, i.e. they will not write to the same state. As such, OCC TPUs execute the set of transactions with all the available resources and only try to <strong>detect</strong> conflicts. If a conflict is <strong>detected</strong> the transactions that conflict are executed and reverified until the entire set passes and can be committed.</p>\n<p>\\\nOCC TPUs donât incur overhead from scheduling, so they tend to perform better when there are few conflicts. OCC-based transaction processing units also have better developer experience and a wider range of use cases because state dependencies donât need to be known upfront.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, when the set of transactions are highly contentious, OCC performs worse than PCC. We cover TPU designs (in far more detail) and compare the OCC and PCC approaches in <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/block-stm_vs_sealevel\">our article</a> on parallel execution.</p>\n<p>\\\nStarknetâs new TPU uses the OCC approach. More specifically, it is an implementation of the Block-STM algorithm. Block-STM executes transactions optimistically with all the available resources assuming none of them will conflict and verifies after execution that no conflicting transactions executed concurrently. Before we dive into Starknetâs new architecture, itâs important to go over some key definitions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>State</strong>: State is the condition of an object at an instance in time. In the blockchain context it usually refers to the value of a portion of memory, e.g., the balance of an address is (part of) its state.</li>\n<li><strong>Serializability</strong>: Parallel execution is said to have preserved the property of serializability if executing a set of transactions serially and concurrently produces the same results.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Two transactions are said to conflict if and only if at least one of them wants to write to a portion of state that both want to access (can be read or write). If both transactions are only reading from a portion of state, then thereâs no conflict but if at least one of them is writing to that portion of state, then the transactions can not be executed concurrently without breaking serializability. We covered a sample case above in the Caitlyn, Danny and Ella example.</li>\n<li><strong>Dependency</strong>: A transaction <code>txj</code> is said to be dependent on (or a dependency of) a transaction <code>txi</code> if and only if both transactions write to the same memory location and <code>txj</code> comes after <code>txi</code> in the serial ordering. If <code>txi</code> came after <code>txj</code>, <code>txi</code> would be dependent on <code>txj</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-version data structure</strong>: A multi-version data structure is one where a new version of the data structure is created for each write to the data structure. Instead of changing the value in place, a new write-specific version of the location to be changed is created. The value prop of multi-version data structures is that they allow highly concurrent reads from and writes to the same region in memory. Weâll explore how this is useful later.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the definitions out of the way we can move on to cover how Block-STM works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howblockstmworks\">How Block-STM works</h2>\n<p>The input to Block-STM is a queue (an ordered list) of transactions, this list is often called a BLOCK. This list can be ordered in any manner; the only requirement is that there is a clearly defined order. So given a set of transactions T containing transactions <code>{t0â¦tn}</code>, the transactions are sorted such that <code>{t0 &gt; t1 &gt; t2 â¦ &gt; tn}</code> (read as <code>t0</code> is of higher priority than <code>t1</code>,&nbsp; <code>t1</code> is of higher priority than <code>t2</code> etc.)</p>\n<p>\\\nAt the beginning of the execution process, two sets are createdâan execution set E, and a validation set V. E tracks transactions that are yet to be executed while V tracks transactions that have been executed but are yet to be validated. Each transaction is also associated with an incarnation number n to track how many times it has been executed (and re-executed). The initial state of the sets is that E contains all the transactions and V is empty, i.e., <code>E = {t0,1 &gt; t1,1 &gt; t2,1 &gt; â¦ &gt; tn,1}</code> and <code>V = {}</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nWith these ordered sets of transactions, each thread used for execution cycles through a three stage loop:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check Done</li>\n<li>Find Next Task</li>\n<li>Perform Task</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"checkdone\">Check Done</h3>\n<p>During this step, the thread checks both V and E. If both are empty and no transaction is being executed then the current batch of transactions has been executed completely and the results can be committed to storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"findnexttask\">Find Next task</h3>\n<p>If either V or E contains transactions, Block-STM selects the transaction with the lowest index (not incarnation number) from both set of transactions, i.e., if E contains <code>{t1,3 , t3,1 and t5,2}</code> and V contains <code>{t0,1, t2,4, t4,3}</code>, the validation task for transaction <code>t0</code> would be selected as the next task.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performtask\">Perform Task</h3>\n<p>Once the next task has been identified and selected, it is performed. At the end of this step, the algorithm loops back to Check Done. This process continues until both sets of transactions are empty.</p>\n<p>\\\nLetâs look at what happens during execution and validation:</p>\n<p>\\\nDuring execution of a transaction, the Block-STM algorithm populates two sets (per transaction); a read set (<code>Ri,n</code>) and a write set (<code>Wn,i</code>). The read set contains all the memory locations that a transaction read from during its execution while the write set contains all the memory locations it wrote to. During execution, the transactions apply their writes to the multi-version data structure, but reading is a little nuanced.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn Block-STM when a transaction wants to read from the data structure, it checks for the value written by the lowest priority transaction that has higher priority. For example if <code>tx1</code>, <code>tx2</code>, and <code>tx7</code> have all written to a memory location and <code>tx5</code> wants to read from this location, it reads the version of the data structure corresponding to <code>tx2</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is done to enforce serializability; since <code>tx5</code> should be executed after <code>tx2</code> and before <code>tx7</code>, it should use the values written by <code>tx2</code> not <code>tx7</code>. In this example, <code>tx7</code> will have to be re-executed because it should have read the values written by <code>tx5</code>, not <code>tx2</code> or any higher priority transactions. If a single-version data structure was used, the value written by <code>tx2</code> would be unavailable and a conflict is sure to occur.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor a validation task, the transactionâs read set is compared to the current values at the memory locations it read from during execution. For example, if <code>tx2</code> reads account B during execution, during validation, the memory location for account B is read (keeping the definition of read we established earlier in mind). If the two values are the same then it means that no higher priority transaction (say <code>tx0</code> or <code>tx1</code>) has written to that location during the execution of <code>tx2</code>. This results in <code>tx2</code> marked as validated but not safe to commit.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe transaction is not considered safe to commit because a lower priority transaction could, for any number of reasons, be executed after the transaction had been validated. In our running example if <code>tx1</code> touches account B and only touches it after, <code>tx2</code> passes validation then <code>tx2</code> needs to be re-executed.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo provision for this, anytime a transaction completes execution all lower priority transactions&nbsp; that had passed validation are revalidated to ensure they do not conflict with the transaction. For example, if <code>tx1</code>, <code>tx3</code> and <code>tx4</code> have been validated and <code>tx2</code> completes execution, <code>tx3</code> and <code>tx4</code> must be revalidated to ensure that they do not conflict with (and so are dependencies of) <code>tx2</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf a transaction fails validation, i.e., a higher priority transaction that writes to the same state was executed concurrently with it, then the writes that the transaction made are dirty (because the values are wrong.) But instead of deleting these values from the database completely, they are flagged ESTIMATE.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe ESTIMATE flag tells any transaction reading that memory location that the values there are not correct and the transactions pause their execution. This is done in place of deletion because re-execution of the transaction that failed validation would likely result in writing to the same memory locations as the previous execution.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy marking the memory location as an estimate instead of deleting it, dependencies (of the transaction that failed validation) can be caught even before re-execution, preventing unnecessary re-executions. This heuristic greatly reduces wasted work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"puttingitalltogether\">Putting it all together</h3>\n<p>A complete overview of how Block-STM approaches parallelization can be summarized as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>BLOCK</code> of transactions start out as an ordered list with a clearly defined serial order. These transactions are executed on all the available resources in priority order.</li>\n<li>During execution, the read and write sets of the transactions are tracked and reads and writes are performed from/to a multi-version data structure. When a transaction finishes execution, it is validated to ensure that it did not execute concurrently with any conflicting transactions.</li>\n<li>If a transaction passes validation, then it is removed from E and V. And when a transaction is validated, all transactions lower in priority than it that had passed validation are rescheduled for validation.</li>\n<li>If a transaction fails validation then it is rescheduled for execution. When the entire set of transactions have been executed and validated then the entire BLOCK is safe to commit and the results can be written to permanent storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nAn example is shown below:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.479Z-jfw70yz60xrnm42dn9on5178\" alt=\"Figure 6: Block-STM example\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThat is an overview of how Block-STM works, more details can be found in our report <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/block-stm_vs_sealevel\">here</a> and the original Block-STM paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06871\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesblockstmimprovestarknetperformance\">How does Block-STM improve Starknet performance?</h3>\n<p>To quantify the significance of adding Block-STM, we performed a few benchmarks to evaluate the performance improvements it provides over sequential execution and the results are shown below.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.457Z-frrc7x2wlax56vqbfpwz9v0n\" alt=\"Figure 7: Block-STM performance at 1k blocksize\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.400Z-t5gfjgvk2kz033f8xymxeisa\" alt=\"Figure 8: Block-STM performance at 10k blocksize\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe results show that as the number of threads (analogous to independent processing units) used increases, performance also increases. The improvements are more pronounced with larger blocks giving as high as 9X performance improvements over sequential execution with just 16 threads. We found that the results are more pronounced with larger blocks.</p>\n<p>\\\nOur tests show that Block-STM performance does significantly degrade under highly contentious load but industry-standard practice is to fall back to sequential execution during such periods. We recommend the same mechanic to Starknet to preserve throughput under highly contentious workloads. But, by and large, the addition of Block-STM will significantly improve and futureproof Starknet.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe second major change bundled in the v0.13.2 upgrade is block packing and weâll cover that next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"boltpart2blockpacking\">Bolt Part 2: Block Packing</h2>\n<p>As discussed earlier, prior to Bolt, each Starknet block was its own job resulting in a fixed per-block cost for every block. In addition, the system was designed such that each block required its own blob regardless of how much data was actually consumed by the block.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a world where there was always high demand, this wouldnât be a problem, but Starknet currently offers more blockspace than there is demand for and so there are a lot of wasted resources that could result in <a href=\"https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-costs-and-fees/113853\">hundreds of ETH lost</a> over the course of a month. To further put into context the severity of the situation before Bolt, these are the costs associated with posting a block to L1:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li>23K gas per fact registration â part of <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x16731babd1ba57874ff4b6554aab379785d986b2aa6b4513d68fd19673bb441a\">Verify Proof and Register</a></li>\n<li>56K gas per <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd808cb7fa32e1a3a241f91e07587339d526d4c47eae8902075f02cabde4f7efc\">register SHARP memory page</a></li>\n<li>136K gas per <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x08ce859bc5d0eb7a5c159d50428841e88878691e378704aa636a968b2a7a3ee8\">State Update</a></li>\n<li>50K gas for the KZG precompile to sample a blob,</li>\n<li>86K gas for running the state update function.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nThis totals out to 215k gas per block and this cost is flat, i.e., itâs the same regardless of how much data each block contains and related to the number of blocks by $Cost = num blocks * 215000$. The ideal solution to this problem would be for costs to be related to the amount of data posted instead of the amount of blocks. And thatâs exactly what block packing achieves via SNAR trees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"snartries\">SNAR Tries</h3>\n<p>Starknet Applicative Recursive (SNAR) trees are a new type of binary tree introduced in Bolt to address the problems highlighted above. A SNAR Tree has the following structure: each leaf is a Starknet block and the nodes in all other levels are recursive proofs of their children. The root node which is a recursive proof of all other proofs is the final job that is sent to the SHARed Prover (SHARP).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.256Z-kf8xoqfmknwm9x9yk28y39lq\" alt=\"Figure 9: SNAR Tree\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.244Z-wu0n0wm0kp61epo00broz5zg\" alt=\"Figure 10: SNAR Tree in Block packing workflow\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"whatdoesthesnartreedo\">What does the SNAR Tree do?</h3>\n<p>The primary benefit of the SNAR Tree is that rather than posting one block per proof, many Starknet blocks can be amortized into the same L1 update. SNAR tree roots are now posted to the L1 only when one of two configurable limits is hit: either the DA limit (6 blobs worth of data) or after a certain number of leaves are added to the tree (where a leaf is a block).</p>\n<p>\\\nThis design decouples the cost for transactions from the number of blocks. Now, there is still some fixed cost for each block that arises from running the StarkNet OS (SNOS) in every blockâbut by and large the costs are decoupled. These are the numbers now:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SHARP memory registration per-job: 23K gas, (same as before)</li>\n<li>SHARP memory page per-job: 36K gas (reduced from 56K thanks to SHARP optimization),</li>\n<li>State update per-job equal to:</li>\n<li>86K gas (same as before) +</li>\n<li>50K gas Ã number of blob used. (When one blob was used per block this was 50K x 1 resulting in the 136K gas number quoted above).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nThe plot in Figure 11 below shows how gas costs vary with block number in the previous design and now (under Bolt):</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:16.071Z-rj1wxee4ltguxaz5thwmsl71\" alt=\"Figure 11: Verification Costs with an without block-packing\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nItâs fairly obvious that block packing greatly reduces the costs of verification on the L1 which will undoubtedly result in lower gas prices for Starknet users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The effect of the changes made in Bolt: optimistic parallel execution via Block-STM and block-packing through the proprietary SNAR can be summarized as: faster and cheaper.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-26T16:00:15.870Z-c5eu1mngosjxt9cn24n3mz8u\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Parallel execution reduces execution time and by extension congestion which will reduce gas fees during periods of high traffic, while SNAR trees tackle the associated DA and proving costs. Interestingly, this upgrade makes Starknet the first L2 with parallel execution and sets it up to be a major contender in the L2 space. Itâs important to note that itâs unlikely that the effect of these changes will be immediately evident, especially that of parallel execution, but they are crucial to future-proofing Starknet and the entire Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>Authorâs note: A version of this article was previously published <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/unpacking-the-starknet-bolt-upgrade\">here</a>.</em></strong></p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Overcoming Multilingual and Multi-Task Challenges in NLP","url":"https://hackernoon.com/overcoming-multilingual-and-multi-task-challenges-in-nlp?source=rss","date":1735228812,"author":"Text Mining","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Atw2lXsJWRm7osebJVC4\">Abstract and Introduction</a></strong> </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Domain and Task</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/gvqItA7L7XcwOscgpVRv\">2.1.

Data heterogeneity, multilingual and multi-task nature</h2>\n<p>As already mentioned many times, compared to research as well as other industry text mining and NLP practices reported in the literature, the data we dealt with are multilingual and heterogeneous such that the goal of the project cannot be achieved by a single type of method, but relates to multiple subfields of text mining and NLP research. While there may be well-established solutions in each of these subfields, as discussed before, the difference in the raw data analysed, the multilingual nature and the lack of training data in our project makes adopting these methods very difficult and time-consuming. Considering the wider principle mentioned above, another lesson we learned is that given such a high level of complexity in our tasks, it is imperative to develop âlightweightâ methods that are easy to maintain, or âgeneralisedâsolutions that could apply to multiple tasks, or both.</p>\n<p>\\\nOn reflection, we opted for treating many tasks as text classification, using a feature representation scheme that is arguably language independent, and applies to, or can be easily adapted to, all of the tasks. Specifically, two components of our pipeline (lot zoning and lot item detection) deal with text classification at different granularity and therefore, the machine learning algorithms can be easily reused across. The feature representations are derived with reference to domain lexicons, which can be more easily and affordably translated into multiple languages - particularly considering the massive amount of multilingual documents we have to analyse, and the fact that only a fraction of them contain really useful content for analysis. Another added benefit of our approach is that it enables domain experts and the system administrators to update the trained models by simply revising the domain lexicons during re-training. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior literature that describes in detail a holistic text mining or NLP process composed of multiple sub-tasks, or develops generalisable solutions like ours. Therefore, our work sets an important reference for future industry projects dealing with complex tasks.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Ziqi Zhang*, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Ziqi.Zhang@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(2) Tomas Jasaitis, Vamstar Ltd., London (Tomas.Jasaitis@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(3) Richard Freeman, Vamstar Ltd., London (Richard.Freeman@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(4) Rowida Alfrjani, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Rowida.Alfrjani@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(5) Adam Funk, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Adam.Funk@sheffield.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03458\">available on arxiv</a></strong> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Ex-CEO Ranks the One Skill That Helped Him Navigate His Life","url":"https://hackernoon.com/ex-ceo-ranks-the-one-skill-that-helped-him-navigate-his-life?source=rss","date":1735228536,"author":"Edwin Liava'a","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>As I sit here anticipating Christmas Eve, wrapping up two project proposals that consumed my entire weekend responding to comments from an evaluator, I've reached an unexpected moment of clarity in my career. Throughout my journey from hands-on engineering roles to executive positions as CEO of Tonga Cable Ltd, CTO at PowerPlay, Corporate and Regional Director at Kacific Broadband Satellites. I've always found my comfort zone in the engine room, deep in the technical trenches where logic and precision reign supreme.</p>\n<p>\\\nMy engineering DNA, forged through decades of work across diverse domains from geospatial systems to blockchain technology, from submarine fiber optic cables to satellite communications has always favored efficiency: bullet points, clear metrics, and concise technical summaries. It's a language that resonates perfectly with fellow engineers in my domain, whether we're discussing disaster risk reduction policies for utilities in Micronesia or developing smart contracts on Ethereum, EVM Chains, Hedera and Rootstock.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, my recent experience in consultancy has brought an interesting challenge to light. As someone who has led digital transformation initiatives across the Pacific, from expanding broadband coverage to championing Web3 technologies, I've found myself increasingly adapting my communication style to meet the expectations of evaluators who prefer their technical content served with a generous helping of narrative prose, what I playfully call \"sugar coating.\"</p>\n<p>\\\nThis weekend's proposal marathon has been particularly enlightening. As I transformed technical specifications into flowing narratives, I realized something crucial: perhaps it's time for me to evolve once again. Not away from engineering, but rather up the stack, where I can serve as a bridge between the engine room and the boardroom. After all, isn't this what I've been unconsciously doing throughout my career, whether it was making satellite communications accessible across the Pacific, developing GIS solutions for 14 Pacific Island nations, or leading blockchain awareness initiatives.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe younger generation of engineers shouldn't have to spend countless hours converting their precise, technical thinking into elaborate prose just to get their brilliant ideas across. They should be free to focus on what they do best, innovating and solving complex technical challenges. Whether they're working on smart contract security, developing geospatial databases, or expanding digital connectivity, their time is better spent pushing technological boundaries than wrestling with report aesthetics.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis realization aligns perfectly with my ongoing work in digital skills development and capacity building across the Pacific. As someone who has consistently worked to bridge digital divides and remove barriers to technology adoption, perhaps this is my next calling, to be the translator, the facilitator who can help streamline this process. Having been both in the engine room and the boardroom, understanding both languages fluently, I can create more value by helping these talented engineers navigate the sometimes Byzantine world of corporate communication.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs I serenade Christmas tunes after submitting these proposals, I'm energized by this new perspective. My journey from a humble beginnings of a computer operator at the Tonga Electric Power Board to leading major digital infrastructure projects has taught me that sometimes the most valuable revelations come not from the work itself, but from reflecting on how we do that work and why. It's time to leverage this experience to create pathways for the next generation of Pacific engineers, ensuring their brilliant technical solutions don't get lost in translation.</p>\n<p>\\\nWishing you all a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year! The journey continuesâ¦</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"US Data Center Boom Creates Windfall For Electricians","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/26/1513222/us-data-center-boom-creates-windfall-for-electricians?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735225980,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Data center construction is driving an unprecedented influx of electricians to central Washington state, where abundant hydropower and tax incentives have attracted major tech companies building AI infrastructure, New York Times is reporting. \n\nMicrosoft alone projects needing 2,300 electricians in coming years for facilities across three counties along the Columbia River.

Founding Father Benjamin Franklin objected to the creature being chosen to represent the country, calling it a \"bird of bad moral character.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Bald+Eagle+Officially+Declared+US+National+Bird+After+250+Years%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F26%2F0854206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F26%2F0854206%2Fbald-eagle-officially-declared-us-national-bird-after-250-years%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/26/0854206/bald-eagle-officially-declared-us-national-bird-after-250-years?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23561553&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Japan Airlines Hit By Cyberattack, Delaying Flights During Year-End Holiday Season","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/24/12/26/0544247/japan-airlines-hit-by-cyberattack-delaying-flights-during-year-end-holiday-season?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735198200,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Japan Airlines said it was hit by a cyberattack Thursday, causing delays to more than 20 domestic flights but the carrier said there was no impact on flight safety.

This arrangement is now under scrutiny in the U.S. government's antitrust case against Google. \n\nCue said Apple lacks the specialized professionals and infrastructure needed for search advertising, which would be essential for a viable search engine.

From a report: Tens of thousands of online retailers now offer the service for a few dollars per order. The fees go to young companies -- Route and Corso, to name two -- that promise to make customers whole without charging the merchant if a delivery doesn't arrive. Consumers are finding that retailers either ask them to pay for package protection or draw a harder line when it comes to replacing a missing item. Some retailers are making the fees mandatory, spreading the burden of package theft among all customers. \n\nTo know whether you are paying the fee, review your order before you press purchase. Sometimes it is named after the company offering protection, and sometimes it is called shipping insurance or package protection. Skincare brand Topicals began using Corso two years ago after seeing 30% of its packages were regularly marked delivered but not received, according to customer insights manager Deja Jefferson. By requiring protection, which Topicals discloses on its shipping page, the company doesn't have to worry about convincing customers to opt in. \"We actually don't get any complaints on it whatsoever,\" she said.
