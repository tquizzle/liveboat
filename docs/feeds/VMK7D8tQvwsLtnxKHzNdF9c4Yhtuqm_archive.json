It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.\n</div><p>We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.</p><p>But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.</p><p>Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.</p><p>Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.</p><p>Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.</p><p>The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak\">They know</a> that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.</p><p>With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.</p><p>We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.</p><p>Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEJpZjg8GuA\">algorithmic complacency</a>, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.</p><p>It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.</p><p>We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.</p><ol><li>Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.</li><li>Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.</li><li>Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, <a href=\"https://bsky.app\">Bluesky</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-rss-feeds/\">RSS feeds</a></li><li>Be mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.</li><li>Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.</li></ol><p>The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.</p>","contentLength":4057,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43302132"},{"title":"Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to Surveillance","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/first-porn-now-skin-cream-age-verification-bills-are-out-control","date":1741372442,"author":"hn_acker","guid":172,"unread":true,"content":"<h3><b>Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to Surveillance</b></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.route-fifty.com/digital-government/2025/02/alabama-house-bills-would-limit-social-media-access-minors/403172/?oref=rf-homepage-river\"></a></p><ol><li><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB728\"></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A3323\"></a></li><li><a href=\"https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5622&amp;Initiative=False&amp;Year=2025\"></a></li></ol><h3><b>The Problem with Age Verification: No Solution Is Safe</b></h3><p><b>no method of age verification is both privacy-protective and entirely accurate</b><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/eff-new-york-age-verification-threatens-everyones-speech-and-privacy\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/face-scans-estimate-our-age-creepy-af-and-harmful\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/hack-age-verification-company-shows-privacy-danger-social-media-laws\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/analyzing-kosas-constitutional-problems-depth\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms\"></a></p>","contentLength":181,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43292820"},{"title":"Mistral OCR","url":"https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-ocr","date":1741282779,"author":"littlemerman","guid":171,"unread":true,"content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout history, advancements in information abstraction and retrieval have driven human progress. From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.data.gov/glossary/unstructured-data/\">90%</a> of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing <a href=\"https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/document/\">Mistral OCR</a>. <p>Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.</p></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API  at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite&nbsp;<a href=\"http://console.mistral.ai\">la Plateforme</a>, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.</p><ol><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">State of the art understanding of complex documents</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Natively multilingual and multimodal</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Doc-as-prompt, structured output</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Selectively available to self-host for organizations dealing with highly sensitive or classified information</p></li></ol><h3 dir=\"ltr\">State of the art understanding of complex documents</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mistral OCR excels in understanding complex document elements, including interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting. The model enables deeper understanding of rich documents such as scientific papers with charts, graphs, equations and figures.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Below is an example of the model extracting text as well as imagery from a given PDF into a markdown file. You can access the notebook <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11NdqWVwC_TtJyKT6cmuap4l9SryAeeVt?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Below we have side-by-side comparisons of PDFs and their respective OCR's outputs. Hover the slider&nbsp; to switch between input and output.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mistral OCR has consistently outperformed other leading OCR models in rigorous benchmark tests. Its superior accuracy across multiple aspects of document analysis is illustrated below. We extract embedded images from documents along with text. The other LLMs compared below, do not have that capability. For a fair comparison, we evaluate them on our internal “text-only” test-set containing various publication papers, and PDFs from the web; below:</p><div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Since Mistral’s founding, we have aspired to serve the world with our models, and consequently strived for multilingual capabilities across our offerings. Mistral OCR takes this to a new level, being able to parse, understand, and transcribe thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents. This versatility is crucial for both global organizations that handle documents from diverse linguistic backgrounds, as well as hyperlocal businesses serving niche markets.</p><div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><table><thead><tr><th>Fuzzy Match in Generation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Being lighter weight than most models in the category, Mistral OCR performs significantly faster than its peers, processing up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node. The ability to rapidly process documents ensures continuous learning and improvement even for high-throughput environments.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Doc-as-prompt, structured output</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mistral OCR also introduces the use of documents as prompts, enabling more powerful and precise instructions. This capability allows users to extract specific information from documents and format it in structured outputs, such as JSON. Users can chain extracted outputs into downstream function calls and build agents.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Available to self-host on a selective basis</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">For organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, Mistral OCR offers a self-hosting option. This ensures that sensitive or classified information remains secure within your own infrastructure, providing compliance with regulatory and security standards. If you would like to explore self-deployment with us, please <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/contact\">let us know</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We are empowering our beta customers to elevate their organizational knowledge by transforming their extensive document repositories into actions and solutions. Some of the key use cases where our technology is making a significant impact include:</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digitizing scientific research</strong>: Leading research institutions have been experimenting with Mistral OCR to convert scientific papers and journals into AI-ready formats, making them accessible to downstream intelligence engines. This has facilitated measurably faster collaboration and accelerated scientific workflows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Preserving historical and cultural heritage</strong>: Organizations and nonprofits that are custodians of heritage have been using Mistral OCR to digitize historical documents and artifacts, ensuring their preservation and making them accessible to a broader audience.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Streamlining customer service</strong>: Customer service departments are exploring Mistral OCR to transform documentation and manuals into indexed knowledge, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making literature across design, education, legal, etc. AI ready</strong>: Mistral OCR has also been helping companies convert technical literature, engineering drawings, lecture notes, presentations, regulatory filings and much more into indexed, answer-ready formats, unlocking intelligence and productivity across millions of documents.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mistral OCR capabilities are free to try on <a href=\"http://chat.mistral.ai\">le Chat</a>. To try the API, head over to <a href=\"http://console.mistral.ai\">la Plateforme</a>. We’d love to get your feedback; expect the model to continue to get even better in the weeks to come.

That happened when I started running a simple server from my trusty old Raspberry Pi version 1.</p><p>I know its local IP address and can  into it easily when I’m home, but when I’m outside, that’s not possible as it’s not exposed to the internet. For that reason, I have used DDNS in the past. The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)</p><p>This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.</p><p>Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with  command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.</p><p>To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.</p><p>Some additional and surprising benefits:</p><ol><li>Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for <a href=\"https://ngrok.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ngrok</a> for. You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. <code>http://my-macbook-air:3000</code>) to effortlessly connect to your development server.</li><li><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1106/taildrop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Taildrop</a>: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!</li><li><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Exit nodes</a>: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job. With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.</li><li><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mullvad exit nodes</a>: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the <a href=\"https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tailscale-has-partnered-with-mullvad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mullvad partnership</a>, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">iCloud Private Relay</a>. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.</li></ol><p>Disclaimer: I haven’t yet tried exit nodes or Mullvad integration, so your actual experience may not turn out as I described.</p><p>I have used Tailscale only for personal reasons so far, using the free tier; they have enterprise plans for enterprise use cases that I have no idea about. I found it useful and wanted to share it in case it helps you too. I wasn’t paid by them, and if you don’t want to use their services for any reason, there’s an open-source server implementation called <a href=\"https://headscale.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Headscale</a>, which works with their client software.</p><p>If you have more use cases, feel free to share them with me!</p>","contentLength":3720,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43270835"},{"title":"Apple takes UK to court over 'backdoor' order","url":"https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/05/apple_reportedly_ipt_complaint/","date":1741198026,"author":"latexr","guid":166,"unread":true,"content":"<p> Apple has reportedly filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) contesting the British government's order that it must forcibly break the encryption of iCloud data.</p><p>The appeal will be the first of its kind lodged with the IPT, an independent judicial body that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/\">oversees</a> legal complaints against potential unlawful actions by a public authority or UK intelligence services, according to the Financial Times, which broke the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d8fe709-f17a-44a6-97ae-f1bbe6d0dccd\" rel=\"nofollow\">news</a>.</p><p>The revelation follows a battle between the iGadgetmaker and the UK's Home Office, which has long set its sights on Apple's encrypted cloud-hosted data, arguing it needs a backdoor in order for law enforcement to investigate persons of interest.</p><p>Things came to a head in January when the Home Office issued Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/26/investigatory_powers_bill/\">Investigatory Powers Act</a>, aka the Snooper's Charter, nearly a year after talk of such an order began.</p><p>Despite being \"technical\" by name, it's understood that the notice didn't include any technical instructions for Apple, just an order to allow a so-called backdoor into its iCloud network which could be used to gather data that's otherwise typically out of reach of criminal investigators.</p><p>The Home Office refused to either confirm or deny the existence of the notice when <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/home_office_apple_backdoor_order/\">we asked about it</a>, and under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 Apple is prevented from revealing details about the notice.</p><p>Apple responded by <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/home_office_apple_backdoor_order/\">disabling its Advanced Data Protection</a> (ADP) feature for UK users in early February, effectively removing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for data backed up to iCloud to appease the government without fully complying with the TCN.</p><blockquote><p>We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will</p></blockquote><p>Still, it means British officials can feasibly sniff around iCloud accounts, provided they get a court-approved warrant to do so. With ADP disabled, various types of user account data – such as iCloud backups, photos, and notes, but not iMessages and health data – stored in Apple's cloud will not be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), meaning the contents can be accessed and provided by Apple to investigators upon legal demand. It will also be done without alerting users, assuming someone involved in the process doesn't leak it at any stage.</p><p>\"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" Apple told  at the time.</p><p>\"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,\" it added.</p><p>The Home Office has also previously voiced its ambition to break E2EE for all popular communications platforms in the UK, such as messaging app WhatsApp, although the case with Apple is believed to be its first foray into handing out TCNs to this end.</p><p>The UK's entire approach to pressing ahead with the Investigatory Powers Act and its so-called war on encryption has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.</p><p>Its main arguments in favor of breaking encryption are largely based on the prevention of terror attacks and child sexual exploitation.</p><p>Security minister Dan Jarvis further justified the powers in Parliament <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pbc/2023-24/Investigatory+Powers+(Amendment)+Bill/\">last week</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-02-24/debates/9E7881D8-1693-48BA-9407-A180094039B6/HostileStateThreats\">saying</a> requests to access user data under the Act could only be made on an \"exceptional basis, and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\"</p><p>Jarvis's comments came after being questioned by other MPs about the TCN, and seemingly aim to dissuade the public from thinking the government can simply access user data on a whim.</p><p>The security minister didn't offer much in the way of additional insights, whipping out the good old national security defense as a way to avoid further questioning.</p><p>Many who argue against the government's ambitions, such as Big Brother Watch, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/24/apple_adp_replacements_e2ee/\">say</a> the action taken against Apple is \"outrageous\" and \"draconian\" and may eventually force encrypted messaging technology underground, meaning only criminals would have access to it.</p><p>US President Donald Trump also recently compared the UK's treatment of Apple to the extensive state surveillance methods deployed by China – the two countries' foremost intelligence adversary.</p><p>US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has ordered a legal review of the TCN issued to Apple out of concern it could be used to gather data on US citizens.

If\nyou look carefully at a HOM effect, you should see three distinct\nimages being cycled between.</p></blockquote><p>Another reason John game me for using Mode-Y back in the days is that the tools used by the graphic team (Deluxe Paint) only supported 320x200 (whereas Mode-X is 320x240).</p><blockquote><p>\nLow detail is 160*200 in the view screen.

Pixels 0,4,8 are\nin plane 0, pixels 1,5,9 are in plane 1, etc.\n</p><p>\nThe registers don't need to be programed all that much. The map mask\nregister only needs to be set once for each vertical column, and four\ntimes for each horizontal row (I step by four pixels in the inner\nloop to stay on the same plane, then increment the start pixel and\nmove to the next plane).\n</p><p>\nIt is still a lot of grief, and it polutes the program quite a bit,\nbut texture mapping directly to the video memory gives you a fair\namount of extra speed (10% - 15%) on most video cards because the\nvideo writes are interleaved with main memory accesses and texture\ncalculations, giving the write time to complete without stalling.\n</p><p>\nGoing to that trouble also gets a perfect page flip, rather than the\ntearing you get with main memory buffering.</p></blockquote><p>Heretic was released in 1994.

This mode combines the advantages of Mode Y with the optimized rendering code from Heretic while avoiding any OUT instructions—except for one to switch buffers, which executes only once per rendered frame. The only downside is that it requires a VLB or PCI graphics card with LFB enabled and has slower performance in low-detail and potato-detail modes.</p><div>- Conversation with Viti95</div></blockquote><p>Note that both  and  require support for VESA 2.0 which my IBM 2168 does not have. Attempting to run these results in errors (<a href=\"https://fabiensanglard.net/fastdoom/FDOOMVBD.png\">FDOOMVBD.BMP</a>, <a href=\"https://fabiensanglard.net/fastdoom/FDOOMVBR.png\">FDOOMVBR.BMP</a>).</p><blockquote>\nIn FastDoom, Mode 13h uses a single framebuffer in RAM, which is copied to VRAM after the entire scene is rendered. Vsync is not enforced, which may result in flickering. There are two methods for copying the backbuffer to VRAM, optimized for different bus speeds. For slow buses (8-bit ISA), a differential copy method is used, transferring only modified pixels.\n<p>\nThis approach involves many branches but is faster overall because branching is less expensive than excessive bus transfers. For faster buses (16-bit ISA, VLB, PCI, etc.), a full backbuffer copy is performed using REP MOVS instructions, which is efficient when the bus bandwidth is sufficient.\n</p><div>- Conversation with Viti95</div></blockquote><div>More optimization which did not work</div><p>Another venue I appreciated seeing explored is OpenWatcom's processor-specific flags (/ vs /)<a name=\"back_9\" href=\"https://fabiensanglard.net/fastdoom/index.html#footnote_9\"></a>. Both wcc386's 386 and 486 flags were attempted but ultimately discontinued\n  because the 386 version always seemed faster.</p><blockquote>\nOne of my goals for FastDoom is to switch the compiler from OpenWatcom v2 to DJGPP (GCC), which has been shown to produce faster code with the same source. Alternatively, it would be great if someone could improve OpenWatcom v2 to close the performance gap.\n <div>- Conversation with Viti95</div></blockquote><p>What splendid work by Victor Nieto!\n If software can die from a thousand cuts, Viti95 made fastDOOM awesome with three thousand optimizations! \n  Not only he leveraged existing improvements (crispy, psx, gba, Lee Killough), he also came up with many news one\nand generated so much hype that even Ken Silverman (author of Duke3D build engine) came <a href=\"https://github.com/viti95/FastDoom/issues/143\">to participate</a><a name=\"back_10\" href=\"https://fabiensanglard.net/fastdoom/index.html#footnote_10\"></a>.\n<p> I tip my beret to you Victor!</p></p>","contentLength":19238,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43258709"},{"title":"Show HN: Bayleaf – Building a low-profile wireless split keyboard","url":"https://www.graz.io/articles/bayleaf-wireless-keyboard","date":1741100451,"author":"sgraz","guid":99,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43255529"},{"title":"Repairable Flatpack Toaster","url":"https://www.kaseyhou.com/#/repairable-flatpack-toaster/","date":1741036796,"author":"t-3","guid":162,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43246892"},{"title":"Apple's Software Quality Crisis","url":"https://www.eliseomartelli.it/blog/2025-03-02-apple-quality","date":1741017853,"author":"ajdude","guid":161,"unread":true,"content":"<section><div><p>Mar 2, 2025 - ⏱️ 4 minutes to read</p></div></section><p>I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/eliseomartelli/Thermals\">small application</a> that outputs\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo/thermalstate\"></a>.\nThe reported Thermal State is  when the iPad is not heating, \nwhen the iPad started to heat and  when the iPad was hurting to touch.\nI defintely had the iPad heating more than  on other occurrences.</p><p>The response to this post has been overwhelming, with sharing on\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43243075\">Hacker News</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1j2j7b4/apples_software_quality_crisis_when_premium/\">Reddit</a>.\nIt's clear that many others are experiencing frustrations with Apple's\nsoftware, indicating quality issue within Apple's OSes portfolio.</p><p>To provide more context, here's the workflow that triggers these issues:\nI create a new note at the start of each lecture, add a title and tags\nfor organization, and begin writing with my Apple Pencil Pro.The issues manifest after filling roughly one page (or \"screen\")\nwith handwritten notes. The iPad here starts to overheat, and lag spikes become\nincreasingly frequent.</p><p>As a long-time Apple user, I've always appreciated the integration of\nhardware and software, signature of the Apple ecosystem. However, recent\nexperiences with my iPad Air 11\" M2 has left me questioning whether\nApple has lost sight of what once made their products great.</p><ul><li>: Visited the Apple Store in Turin with my then new iPad\nAir 11\" M2 experiencing significant lag and overheating when using Notes and\nFreeform with Apple Pencil Pro.</li><li>: Received a replacement unit after store\nrepresentatives suggested a hardware swap.</li><li>: The replacement unit is now having identical\nperformance issues.</li></ul><h2>Premium Hardware, Struggling Software</h2><p>In November, I visited the Apple Store in Turin to address persistent issues\nwith my iPad Air 11\" M2 running iPadOS 18.1. Despite having cutting-edge\nhardware, I've been experiencing significant lag when using  Apple\napplications like Notes and Freeform.</p><p>The performance issues don't stop at sluggish response times. During these\nuse cases, my iPad overheated, making it uncomfortable to\nhold or even rest the palm on, raising concerns about potential long-term\nhardware damage.</p><p>What made this particularly frustrating is that these aren't third-party\napplications pushing the hardware to its limits. These are Apple's own\napplications that should be  optimized for their hardware.</p><p>After demonstrating the issues in person to Apple Store staff (that were\ncourteous and professional), the support representative that was handling my\ncase suggested a hardware replacement.However, after further discussion, we\nboth concluded this was likely a software problem rather than a\nhardware defect.</p><p>I think this highlights a growing challenge for Apple's support model:\nhow do you troubleshoot software issues when the traditional solution has been\nto replace hardware?</p><p>I think this experience feels symptomatic of a broader decline in Apple's\nsoftware quality.</p><p>My replacement iPad Air 11\" M2 with the Apple Pencil Pro is once again\nstruggling with the same basic tasks. Despite multiple iPadOS updates since my\noriginal complaint (we're now on 18.3.1), the fundamental issues remain:</p><ul><li><strong>Significant lag when using Apple's own Notes and Freeform applications</strong>:\nInput latency increases dramatically after about 5-10 minutes of use, with\nstroke rendering delayed by up to 5 seconds;</li><li><strong>Device overheating during standard usage scenarios</strong>: CPU temperatures\nreach concerning levels (based on device's external heat) during pencil\ninput;</li><li><strong>Poor responsiveness with the Apple Pencil Pro</strong>: Palm rejection fails\nintermittently, and pressure and roll sensitivity becomes inconsistent.</li></ul><p>This recurrence with a replacement device (and other friend's iPads) confirms\nwhat I and the support representative suspected last November - this is a\nsoftware optimization problem, not a hardware defect.</p><p>Since my original complaint, I've discovered\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/search/?q=overheating\">numerous</a> forum threads\nand social media discussions from iPad users experiencing similar issues. This\nsuggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.</p><p>I think these are sympthoms of two main problems:</p><ul><li><strong>Thermal Management Issues</strong>: The SoC should throttle performance\nbefore reaching high external temperatures;</li><li><strong>Memory Management Problems</strong>: The gradual degradation in performance makes\nme think of memory leaks or improper garbage collection in Apple's Note and\nFreeform applications.</li></ul><p>Most concerning is that multiple software updates have failed to address these\nperformance issues while introducing new features that add more strain to the\nsystem (like Apple Intelligence, but that's a story for another day).</p><h2>Reconsidering the \"Apple Tax\"</h2><p>For years, many of us have willingly paid the \"Apple tax\", the premium price\nfor Apple products justified by superior user experience, design, and ecosystem\nintegration. But if software quality continues to decline, this value\nproposition becomes increasingly difficult to defend.</p><p>The persistence of these issues through multiple software updates suggests:</p><ol><li><strong>Feature prioritization over optimization</strong>: Engineering resources appear\nfocused on adding new capabilities rather than fixing existing performance\nproblems;</li><li><strong>Inadequate performance testing</strong>: Real-world usage scenarios with Apple's\nown applications aren't being adequately tested.</li></ol><p>As customers paying premium prices for Apple products, we at least deserve:</p><ol><li>: Acknowledgment of known performance issues;</li><li>: Updates focused on performance and stability;</li><li>: Consideration for extended warranties when software\nissues impact hardware lifespan.</li></ol><p>The Apple experience was once defined by the words \"it just works\".Today, that promise feels hollow as software struggles to keep pace with\nhardware capabilities. As users and customers, we need to vocally advocate for\nthe quality-focused Apple we once knew.</p><p>After months of hoping for improvement, I'm faced with difficult decisions\nabout my future in the Apple ecosystem. This issue, along with several others,\nalbeit smaller, ones, has severely damaged my confidence in new Apple products.</p><p>Apple should return to its roots - creating products that prioritize user\nexperience over feature .

href=\"https://cursor.com\">cursor</a>, an ai text editor. also, i use <a href=\"https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html\">lulu by objective-see</a> on my laptop, so when i downloaded the cursor installer, i got this pop-up:</p><p>now, what the hell is todesktop? i thought i was downloading cursor? well, looking at their website, they seem to be an electron app bundler service alongside providing a SDK for electron apps. so it appears the installer i downloaded is actually managed by todesktop, not cursor.</p><p>this made me curious and i made an account on todesktop to look into it, and when i clicked the github login button, i saw my calling: </p><p>realising the app used firestore (firebase's no-sql database that is often used in frontend), i quickly opened my devtools and began doing basic recon on the firebase.</p><p>i realised that the site has sourcemaps, which made searching for all of the firestore paths used in the app even easier (its still easy without sourcemaps, usually)</p><p>then i found an insecure collection, , which seemed to give me an name list of some applications (edit: todesktop has clarified this collection has no sensitive data and hasnt been updated since 2022), but not much other than that, everything seemed secure on the firebase other then this.</p><p>i then noticed that most of the deployment and general logic happens in the terminal, with the npm package , so i installed that and started looking into it</p><h2>looking into the todesktop cli</h2><p>the cli manages deployments, source code uploads, and much more. the website just seems to be a shell to create applications, view deployments, etc etc</p><p>i was once again lucky that the cli also had sourcemaps, so i used <a href=\"https://github.com/denandz/sourcemapper\">sourcemapper</a> to extract them into a source tree.</p><p>looking in there, i found an arbitrary s3 upload vulnerability via a firebase cloud function called , but i didn't really have an s3 key (file path) to upload to that would do something interesting, so i kept looking.</p><h2>hijacking the deployment pipeline via a postinstall script</h2><p>i wanted to get on the machine where the application gets built and the easiest way to do this would be a postinstall script in , so i did that with a simple reverse shell payload</p><p>this worked. navigating around the container, i figured out where the actual code-building application lives, and found this:</p><p>oh fuck, this usually means something bad. i found the code for decrypting this file, and this is what i got after decrypting it myself:</p><p><strong>fuck. this container stores secrets</strong></p><p>looking around in the container more, i found a hardcoded firebase admin key (which was full-scoped).</p><p>i quickly realized that with the credentials i have, i could deploy an auto update to any app of my liking, having clients receive it immediately when they restart the app.</p><p>i then made some code to use my credentials to deploy an update to my app, and it worked. i immediately got a update on my client and got RCE.</p><p>with this, i could push auto updates to all applications using todesktop, such as:</p><ul><li>clickup (https://clickup.com)</li><li>cursor (https://cursor.com) (update: cursor has now switched off of todesktop to their own build system)</li><li>linear (https://linear.app)</li><li>notion calendar (https://calendar.notion.so)</li></ul><p>(<strong>please do not harass these companies or make it seem like it's their fault, it's not. it's todesktop's fault if anything</strong>)</p><p>which, if i were to estimate, is probably in the range of hundreds of millions of people in , other hackers, programmers, executives, etc. making this exploit  if used.</p><p>i immediately used my contacts to get in reach with the owner of todesktop, we were chatting via signal and the fix came almost immediately. they were nice enough to compensate me for my efforts and were very nice in general.</p><p>the build container now has a privileged sidecar that does all of the signing, uploading and everything else instead of the main container with user code having that logic.</p><p>security incidents happen all the time, its natural. what matters is the company's response, and todesktop's response has been awesome, they were very nice to work with.</p><p>check out todesktop's incident report <a href=\"https://www.todesktop.com/blog/posts/security-incident-at-todesktop\">here</a></p><p>for those wondering, in total i got 5k for this vuln, which i dont blame todesktop for because theyre a really small company</p><p> cursor (one of the affected customers) is giving me 50k USD for my

Users will have an opportunity to export their chats to Teams.</p></div></div><p>In a move that will likely surprise no one, it appears Microsoft is gearing up to shut down Skype in the coming months. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/\" target=\"_blank\" data-url=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"></a>, the latest Skype for Windows preview reportedly includes a hidden string that reads <em><strong>\"Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams.\" </strong></em>No other details are provided, but it certainly sounds like Skype's days are numbered.</p><p>The company has updated and redesigned Skype a number of times in the last decade, including splitting the app up in an attempt to integrate the service into Windows 10 Mobile's Phone and Messaging apps to position it as a viable iMessage competitor.</p><p>In the last handful of years, Skype has been seriously neglected. Microsoft failed to position Skype as a viable option during the pandemic, and the service has largely fallen by the wayside in the eyes of consumers. Most people have moved to more modern platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Discord.</p><p>Microsoft did use Skype as a backbone to build out its popular Teams service for enterprise customers, but the experiences between the Teams and Skype apps are very different. Interestingly, it looks like Microsoft will encourage the remaining Skype users to switch to Teams, though this is likely referring to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement\">Teams for Consumers.</a></p><p>Skype in its current form is a sorry excuse for a messaging platform. It's a web-based app on Windows, which is very slow and does a terrible job at syncing conversations and notifications across devices. The app also doesn't even support Windows on Arm, which is something Microsoft has been pushing to adopt over the last half a decade.</p><p>In the last few years, Microsoft has tried to revive Skype with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips\">experiments such as Skype Clips</a>, which let users send short video messages to each other without calling them. In 2024, it also gained access to Copilot, self messaging, and a revamped mobile experience designed to compete with rival platforms.</p><p>Nothing seems to have worked, as the service still hasn't seemed to have gained much traction. The last time Skype received a notable update was in May 2024. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option\">Microsoft recently shuttered its Skype Number service</a>, which let you buy a real phone number that could be used to call other phone numbers not on the Skype service.</p><p>Microsoft has now confirmed that Skype will indeed shut down on May 5, 2025. That means there's just over two months for Skype users to begin the migration to Microsoft Teams.</p><p><em>What are your thoughts on Microsoft killing Skype? Are you an active Skype user?

A few days ago, users noticed that Google had begun disabling uBlock Origin and other Manifest V2-based extensions as part of the migration to Manifest V3. Now, Microsoft Edge  to be following suit.</p><p>The latest Edge Canary version started disabling Manifest V2-based extensions with the following message: \"This extension is no longer supported. Microsoft Edge recommends that you remove it.\" Although the browser turns off old extensions without asking, you can still make them work by clicking \"Manage extension\" and toggling it back (you will have to acknowledge another prompt).</p><p>At this point, it is not entirely clear what is going on. <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-begin-phasing-out-manifest-v2-extensions-in-chrome-on-june-3/\">Google started phasing out Manifest V2 extensions</a> in June 2024, and it has a clear roadmap for the process. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/manifest-v3\">Microsoft's documentation</a>, however, still says \"TBD,\" so the exact dates are not known yet. This leads to some speculating about the situation being one of \"unexpected changes\" coming from Chromium. Either way, sooner or later, Microsoft will ditch MV2-based extensions, so get ready as we wait for Microsoft to shine some light on its plans.</p><p>Another thing worth noting is that the change does not appear to be affecting Edge's stable release or Beta/Dev Channels. For now, only Canary versions disable uBlock Origin and other MV2 extensions, leaving users a way to toggle them back on. Also, the uBlock Origin is <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak\">still available</a> in the Edge Add-ons store, <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-rolls-out-revamped-edge-add-ons-website/\">which recently received a big update</a>.</p><p>In August 2024, when Google started flagging uBlock Origin as unsupported, the extension's maker stepped in and <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/\">recommended users switch to uBlock Origin Lite</a>, a Manifest V3-based extension, and accept some of its limitations. Another option is to switch to Firefox. Mozilla recently <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-manifest-v3-adblockers/\">announced</a> its plans to keep Manifest V2 extensions working, including uBlock Origin, based on Mozilla Manifesto, which claims that \"individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it.\"</p><p>Now, users can either switch to a browser that still supports MV2 extensions or move to MV3-based ad blockers. Of course, not all MV2 extensions have \"more modern\" versions, so for many, switching to Firefox or another browser with MV2 support will be the only option to keep old extensions working.</p><p><em>As an online publication, Neowin relies on ads for operating costs.
