I did not hesitate to use the Linux system.</p> <p>We found most commercial applications and libraries are only available for Windows /Ios/ Android platforms, but except Linux. So we applied Android for this direction.</p> </blockquote> <ol> <li><p>Question. Do you think Supernote deserves a support from the Linux community?</p></li> <li><p>Question. Could the <em>Linux Foundation</em> initiate an open standard for eink development toolkit and libraries?</p></li> </ol> <p>I don&#39;t mind using Android as a Linux fan, but I want to enjoy the freedom of Linux.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xTouny\"> /u/xTouny </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmmcdc/community_efforts_around_linux_or_fosscentered/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmmcdc/community_efforts_around_linux_or_fosscentered/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"systemd Highlights For 2024 From Run0 To Varlink To Advancing systemd-homed","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmkvz9/systemd_highlights_for_2024_from_run0_to_varlink/","date":1735204964,"author":"/u/gabriel_3","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gabriel_3\"> /u/gabriel_3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/systemd-2024-highlights\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmkvz9/systemd_highlights_for_2024_from_run0_to_varlink/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Today I installed linux on my father's laptop","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmgoet/today_i_installed_linux_on_my_fathers_laptop/","date":1735186858,"author":"/u/Allan_Walk","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Me and my sister were visiting our parents for Christmas, and my dad has been complaining about his laptop being slow all year, so I decided to buy a SATA SSD to install Fedora 41 XFCE for him.

He has several old computers laying around as a sort of “homelab” thing. Any idea what he might have wanted that for? I worry he’s going to open his present and have no memory of why he originally wanted this thing. It would be nice if I could give him cool ideas in that moment—but I literally have no idea.</p> <p>Can anyone help? What stuff does a BIOS USB programmer usually gets techy guys excited about? </p> <p>EDIT: He initially added it to his wishlist just to have it with the hope to eventually have a reason to use it and justify its purchase. However, he had not thought of how it could help us reprogram/flash the school provided laptop that had restrictions so that was helpful! He’s still looking forward to any other opportunities, like the other comments, to come up.
