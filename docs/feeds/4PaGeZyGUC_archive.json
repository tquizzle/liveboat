The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.\n\nTo many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. \n\nThe public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn‚Äôt see his family for months so as not to infect them.\n\nWhen the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nBy now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aur√©lie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aur√©lie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.\n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #coronavirus #pandemic \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.\n\nFour women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan‚Äôs hard-won rights. \n\nThe team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #afghanistan #womenrights \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They discuss how productivity isn‚Äôt just about lines of code but is more about focus and minimizing task-switching.\n\nGail also talks about the difficulty of managing the rapid evolution of system architectures, stressing the need for regular restructuring and refactoring to avoid issues like increased coupling and decreased performance. The conversation moves to open-source development, where Gail highlights how using open-source components can create complex, brittle dependencies, and the need for better communication within these ecosystems.\n\nThey wrap up by discussing the evolving role of technical leadership in navigating these challenges.

The blue color scheme, also reflected on her guitar and nail polish, is a nod to the heartache and sadness found across 2024's Am I Okay?\n\nThe self-proclaimed Emo Cowgirl opens her Tiny Desk with \"I'm Not Pretty\" from her 2023 debut Lucky. Backed by pedal steel and sparkling harmonies, she sings about struggles with intrusive thoughts, self-sabotage and peaking in high school. Like all great country music, her songs reveal deeper and universal truths in life's smallest and messiest moments.\n\nBut Moroney's music is as much about resilience as it is grief. For this set, she also includes a version of \"No Caller ID,\" which celebrates the friends who help you move on, as well as \"Tennessee Orange,\" her 2022 breakout hit and ode to young love. She closes with the title cut to Am I Okay? \"In my discography of sad songs,\" she tells the NPR Music office, \"it's proof that a man was once making me happy.\" She quickly adds, \"It's no longer true, but fun while it lasted!\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"I'm Not Pretty\"\n\"No Caller ID\"\n\"Tennessee Orange\"\n\"Am I Okay?\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMegan Moroney: vocals, guitar\nRiley Lowery: guitar, background vocals\nJohn Barker: guitar\nEric Pritchard: drums\nAlex Shernit: bass, background vocals\nJustin Schipper: pedal steel\nAmie Miriello: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Robin Hilton\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #meganmoroney</article>","contentLength":2094,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/jtRXy0mGtTs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"If You're Doing Well, but Your Tired, Listen to This.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YzhuK4qO08","date":1741339803,"author":"Jocko Podcast","guid":409,"unread":true,"content":"<article>From Jocko Underground 137.\nJoin Jocko Underground: https://www.jockounderground.com/subscribe\n\nI'm crushing life, but I'm always tired.

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU‚Äôs border protection agency‚Äôs reputation. But now, it‚Äôs trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.\n\nThe message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? \nThe new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He‚Äôs said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #frontex #humanrights #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

That‚Äôs not new.\n\nSupport our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOn the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump‚Äôs order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges ‚Äî but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it‚Äôs uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it‚Äôs very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today‚Äôs concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They‚Äôre actually not.\n\n00:00 A rule\n2:23 Jus soli\n3:13 Dred Scott\n4:46 The 14th Amendment\n8:02 Wong Kim Ark\n10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nGarrett Epps‚Äôs law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you‚Äôll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1607&amp;context=aulr\n\nThe Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf\n\nSome original documents we use in the piece:\n\nTrump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02007.pdf\n\nThe Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf\n\nThe Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson‚Äôs letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/veto-message-438\n\nCongress‚Äôs debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/congress-39-session-1-part-1.pdf\n\nThe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000/pdf/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000.pdf\n\nThe Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep169/usrep169649/usrep169649.pdf\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.\n\nWith this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.\n\nLearn how to empower AI to work for you.

This special forest is home to countless spruce and fir trees. One very special species towers above them all, giving many animals shelter: the giant arbor vitae, or ‚ÄòTree of Life‚Äô.\n\nThe proud giant, which can live for up to a thousand years, plays an important role in the mythology of the Nuxalk. These indigenous people communicate with their ancestors through the tree. But the tree of life also plays a key role in the ecosystem and is home to numerous species - from the smallest insects to stately mammals. The animals crawl into its trunk or find shelter under its bushy foliage. \n\nThe giant arbor vitae has watched over the Canadian rainforest and the adjacent ocean for thousands of years. Every fall, the salmon return to their native rivers in the middle of the Great Bear Rainforest after spending several years at sea. They fight their way upstream to spawn - and provide a feast for the bears, who devour the delicious fish in the shade of the trees. \nNothing is lost in the forest. Scavengers feed on any remains left among the tree roots and whatever is left nourishes the rich forest soil with nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, even the salmon promote tree growth and contribute to a unique ecosystem. \n\nForest and ocean live in symbiosis here. When heavy rainfall erodes the soil, nutrients are transported through the rivers to the sea, where they benefit the humpback whales. Nowadays, however, this complex ecosystem is threatened by massive logging. Here, too, humans are jeopardizing a balance that has existed for thousands of years.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #canada #environment #nature \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But what if we revisit the fundamentals? Embrace simplicity and speed using Vanilla JS, modern browser APIs, and different server architectures, including site generators.\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about embracing the simplicity and speed of development that comes with a ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô approach.\n\nThis session is all about exploring how to craft rich web apps and websites using nothing but the HTTP protocol, core JavaScript, and browser APIs‚Äîno dependencies, just pure power! If you have never created apps with Vanilla JS or without a library, now is the perfect time to understand it.\n\nWe‚Äôll journey through the modern landscape of JavaScript‚Äôs foundational features, which have evolved into a robust suite of tools. From Web Components to Shadow DOM, reactivity and declarative templates, PWA APIs, reactive programming, and client-side routing, we‚Äôll uncover how to harness these powerful features typically provided by libraries.\n\nWe‚Äôll also delve into server-side architectures and how to use static site generators for some websites and web apps.\n\nLet‚Äôs rediscover the potential of returning to the roots of web development and see what your code can do without libraries or frameworks!

Little did we know that the young, unassuming musician named Saya Gray would be playing at the Desk seven years later, this time front and center.\n\nGray's pop songs are experimental in nature, so I was eager to hear how her music would cozy up to our space. That inclination to stretch out and try anything comes from her musical family: Her mother, who moved from Japan to Canada, founded Toronto's Discover Through the Arts music school, and her dad, a jazz trumpeter, studied at the Berklee College of Music.\n\nGray leans into the challenge of the Tiny Desk and strips elements away.

The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn‚Äôt have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.\n\nWe visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.\n\nFor those who couldn‚Äôt afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas‚Äîmulti-story buildings in Rome‚Äîrelied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.\n\nFish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.</article>","contentLength":2898,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/utTF7dXcxfQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neil & a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM","date":1741114490,"author":"StarTalk","guid":252,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.\n\nWe begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.\n\nFusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches‚Äîfrom Princeton‚Äôs tokamak designs to Livermore‚Äôs laser-driven experiments‚Äîand why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.\n\nBut fusion isn‚Äôt just about energy‚Äîit‚Äôs also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.\n\nFinally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs?

The World Food Programme says nearly 25 million people are facing acute food shortages - all driven by a war that has received little international attention.\n\nAid organizations warn that the dimension of the crisis surpasses those in Ukraine, Gaza and Somalia combined. The conflict has been running since 2023, pitting army chief and de facto president Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan against his former deputy Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The fighting has displaced 12 million people, roughly a quarter of the population. Yet, the crisis is barely present in the international media. That‚Äôs partly because journalists are rarely given access to the war zone. But DW correspondent Mariel M√ºller managed to secure permission to film from the Sudanese army. Embedded with military forces, she traveled to the capital Khartoum, where the paramilitary RSF control swathes of territory and the battle for dominance continues to rage - leaving the civilian population trapped in the crossfire. And the conflict shows no signs of ending soon.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sudan #warzone \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They discuss how smaller, well-organized pull requests lead to better feedback, the importance of comment classification, and when to take discussions offline. Both emphasize that code reviews aren't just about catching bugs‚Äîthey're crucial for knowledge transfer and creating cohesive codebases.\n\nWhile AI tools can help with routine aspects, human judgment remains essential, especially as AI-generated code becomes more common. The speakers agree that when done well, code reviews become one of the most valuable practices in software development.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:50 What is code review &amp; why does it matter?\n14:47 The art of code reviews: Why small, structured PRs matter\n23:42 Effective code reviews: The reviewer‚Äôs role &amp; responsibility\n27:51 Code review clarity: Tagging comments for better collaboration\n32:24 Handling disagreements\n36:08 Pair programming vs code reviews\n38:55 AI &amp; code reviews\n41:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAdrienne Braganza Tacke ‚Ä¢ \"Looks Good to Me\": Constructive Code Reviews ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3E75XrD\nAdrienne Braganza Tacke ‚Ä¢ Coding for Kids ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3Ukd5Gw\nSa≈°a Juriƒá ‚Ä¢ Elixir in Action ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2RZh5eN\nGrace Huang ‚Ä¢ Code Reviews in Tech ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4fbwYr8\nMartin Fowler ‚Ä¢ Refactoring ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3EVcHXQ\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#CodeReviews #PullRequest #TeamDynamics #CodeQuality #PairProgramming #TeamHappiness #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #AdrienneBraganza #AdrienneTacke #SasaJuric\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

That‚Äôs where the versatile South African cellist and vocalist told the touching story of how he first got the hang of his instrument. Unable to afford a real cello, Selaocoe drew the strings of the instrument on paper, then pasted it to his chest to practice the fingerings.\n\nThese days, he tours the world offering his singular synthesis of global, jazz and classical sounds, always remembering his roots, even when collaborating with the likes of Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nSelaocoe‚Äôs adroit bowing and percussive fingering gives the cello a vast color palette, with sounds of flutes and drums. His vocalizing, mostly in the Sesotho language, includes a kind of gravelly throat singing in which two or more pitches are produced, heard in the opening song which he dedicates to mothers and strong women who ‚Äú[hold] the knife on the sharp side.‚Äù\n\nFrench baroque meets contemporary South Africa in ‚ÄúLes Voix Humaines/Tsohle Tsohle,‚Äù where Selaocoe braids music by Marin Marais around tender singing. And he closes with an improvisation, noting that he prefers ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt write the script and re-read it again.‚Äù The tune begins in a flurry of bowed arpeggios, like white caps on the lake, and evolves into plucked strings with metal clips attached, reminiscent of thumb pianos.\n\nSelaocoe has indeed written his own distinctive ‚Äúscript.‚Äù In classical music, there are those who follow age-old traditions ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just fine. But then there are those, like Selaocoe, who create brand-new traditions.\n\nSET LIST\n‚ÄúKa Bohaleng‚Äù\nMarin Marais/Selaocoe: ‚ÄúLes Voix Humaines/Tsohle Tsohle‚Äù\n‚ÄúDinaka‚Äù\n\nMUSICIANS\nAbel Selaocoe: cello, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Tom Huizenga\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Editor: Kara Frame\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Newell\nProduction Assistant: Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Michael Zamora \nTiny Desk Team: Lars Gotrich, Ashley Pointer\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #abelselaocoe</article>","contentLength":2310,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/GhY31ngpnWg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Jocko Podcast 479: First Troops On The Ground In Afghanistan.

Young people end up there for criminal offenses or because their parents can't cope with their rebellious children.

This is no Orwellian nightmare, but the \"Peach Reform School‚Äù, a Chinese juvenile detention center. The documentary, which was filmed at the school for over a year, provides deeply disturbing insights into the Chinese juvenile detention system. From the frightened 11-year-old Wenjun to the secret teenage lovers Lei-gong and Chanjuan to the rough, but ambivalent teacher Zhou Hai. The intimate access to these characters reveals victims in a system that values obedience and order over love and friendship.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #china \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, the glue code that we write to stitch everything together tends to be brittle, and a constant inertia to change.\n\nThis talk explores how to leverage existing API specs (OpenAPI and gRPC) to deliver composition and federation of APIs, without writing and maintaining glue code.\n\nWe'll explore how using API Specs as First Class Citizens of our enterprise integration, along with Semantic Metadata, allows us to create a mesh of services that connect on demand, and self-adapt their middleware as services around them change.\n\nThis is an in-depth exploration into Taxi - a meta-language for annotating API specs, and TaxiQL - a query language and open source orchestration engine, which can generate and adapt integration on demand.

Abortions are banned in the state of Texas, but that's not enough for anti-abortion activists. They go even further -- and encounter resistance.\n\nThe film follows one of America's leading abortion opponents, Mark Lee Dickson, in Texas. He wants to prevent women from traveling to another state for an abortion. Dickson and his followers believe that abortion is always murder.\n\nThey do not even accept the birth control pill. They believe that life begins with the union of sperm and egg. As a result of Texas' strict abortion policy, clinics offering abortions have had to relocate to neighboring New Mexico. \n\nHow do the bans affect women? And what is it like to work as a doctor who performs abortions? The film examines questions like these.

But many of them propagated misunderstandings of the properties of the architectural style. Mis-associations with the Cloud Native style, and misapprehensions on how to move from monolith to microservices, meant that the architectures that emerged often bear little resemblance to the original idea; most are just distributed monoliths. Unsurprisingly these architectures are painful and costly to own. Ten years later, the resulting failure to realise the benefits promised by microservices, or a misunderstanding of what they were, has led to a backlash against microservices; now the prevalent wisdom calls for a \"return to the monolith,\" and posters on Reddit have begun to speak of \"Death by a Thousand Microservices.\"\n\nThis talk looks at the key misunderstandings around microservices: the problems that microservices were intended to solve; \"what does micro mean?\"; how to achieve independent deployability; how to avoid anti-patterns like a distributed monolith. It will also explain the problems that a monolith can't solve that cause us to choose microservices.

Companies in the field of science and innovation are being promoted. Climate-friendly ideas for the future are already being realized in African countries.\n\nAfrica has the youngest, fastest-growing population of any continent. This is reflected in the innovative strength emanating from many African nations: young scientists in particular are being supported and are developing creative, climate-friendly strategies that have the potential to solve global problems.\n\nAt the same time, many African countries face immense challenges: political crises, wars, population growth and climate change. Solutions are being developed on a local level. In Kenya, for example, a team of young scientists has succeeded in using new technologies to reduce the price of animal feed production. Mobile communication solutions from Nairobi deliver knowledge and education in indigenous languages to the remotest regions of East Africa. Kenya and Uganda are already supplied with more than 90 per cent renewable energy. A young Afro-German entrepreneur in Kampala is taking advantage of this - he wants to expand e-mobility in private transport. The municipal healthcare system in Accra, Ghana, is already working with artificial intelligence developed in Africa.\n\nHowever, climate change caused by industrialized nations in the northern hemisphere poses a particular threat to Africa. Of the almost 1.5 billion Africans from 54 countries, as many as 117 million people could be at risk from rising sea levels in 2030.  \n\nBy 2100, Africa‚Äôs total population could be around 3.8 billion. One solution under consideration is to build a floating city in Lagos, Nigeria, that can adapt to the consequences of climate change.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #africa #innovation #technology \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, existing programming languages are not necessarily designed for learnability, with cryptic error messages and a lack of easily accessible resources. In this talk, Felienne will outline what issues existing tools have, and how these issues disproportionally affect underrepresented minorities in programming including girls, kids with disabilities and non-English learners.\n\nShe will then outline her story of inventing and creating Hedy, an inclusive, multi-lingual and gradual programming language for learners. Hedy is open source, runs in the browser, is free to use, and available in 47 different languages (Including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Hindi). Hedy was launched in early 2020 and now serves about 300.000 monthly users (Try it for free at https://hedy.org).

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice welcome best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell to explore the hidden forces that drive human behavior.\n\nGladwell shares the origins of The Tipping Point and its new sequel, Revenge of the Tipping Point, sparked by his fascination with epidemiology and crime in 1980s New York. How do social problems spread like viruses? Why do some people‚Äîor places‚Äîbecome \"superspreaders\" of everything from ideas to violence? We uncover the surprising role of environmental contagion in shaping societies and ask whether AI could revolutionize public health and policing.\n\nWe dive into the power of context: why do doctors in Buffalo and Denver treat heart disease differently? What can poop samples tell us about the next pandemic? And why might trained dogs be the future of disease detection? From the science of masks to hotspot policing, Gladwell unpacks the patterns behind epidemics of all kinds‚Äîbiological, social, and criminal.\n\nWhat will future generations find baffling about today? What would happen if we gave epidemiologists endless resources?

Will pro-Russian political forces assume power over the country for good - leaving hopes of joining the EU shattered? With growing fears of the country descending into a dictatorship, young people are taking to the streets - to protest.\n\nMuch of Tbilisi's famed nightclub scene is on pause, with ravers being urged to spend their nights on demonstrations instead of the dancefloor. Among their various demands: a rerun of the parliamentary elections held in October 2024, when the ruling Georgian Dream party won a majority - while the opposition says they were rigged. In late November the government then announced it would be suspending negotiations for EU membership until 2028. Photographer and heavy metal musician Hitori Ni refuses to accept this new situation and has been joining the nightly protests. Normally bastions of freedom and self-expression, the city's clubs have in any case shut their doors to send out a signal: that fighting for democracy and human rights takes priority over partying. \nOn the other side of the debate is Temur Maisuradze. The management professor says that the EU is turning its back on Georgia, not vice versa, and sees the country's future closely aligned with Russia. That's a view shared by the man often called Georgia's unofficial leader: Bidzina Ivanishvili, who has been playing a key role in recent developments. An investigative journalist reveals her findings about the secretive billionaire.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #georgia #europe #russia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We'll apply prompt engineering principles to a real-world AI use-case and make the strategic trade-offs needed to make your AI products economically viable.\n\nIf you have tried prompting to automate a task, but couldn't get good enough results, this talk will give you actionable steps for closing that gap. You'll take away a checklist for optimizing prompts from idea to production, using principles that are transferable across models and modalities.

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen.

Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth.

With data centers consuming massive amounts of electricity, can we keep up? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Gary O‚ÄôReilly and Paul Mecurio discuss the physics, safety, and future of nuclear reactors in a world of increasing power demands with nuclear engineer Kathryn Huff.\n\nWe start by breaking down the basics: fusion vs. fission. How does nuclear stack up against other energy sources? Are past accidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island common? Can rebranding nuclear change public perception? Kathryn walks us through the hard numbers, why its energy density makes it an attractive option, and how modern regulations have made it one of the safest power sources.\n\nWith data centers, AI, and industrial manufacturing driving massive electricity demand, can our energy production keep up? We explore the rise of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and why they may be the future of scalable, local power generation. From advanced coolants to molten salt reactors, we explore the next generation of fission that is pushing the boundaries of efficiency.\n\nBut what about nuclear waste? Kathryn explains how spent fuel recycling could reduce waste and even provide materials for medical imaging. We also examine the geopolitical challenges of uranium sourcing and the need for international collaboration. Plus, what would it take to power your house with its own nuclear reactor? Spoiler: It‚Äôs not as simple as plugging in a Mr. Fusion.\n\nFinally, we take a cosmic perspective on energy: Was the future we imagined in the Atomic Age derailed by the rise of information technology? Are we on the cusp of a new energy revolution? All this, plus Neil‚Äôs take on the wildest misconceptions about nuclear power, in an electrifying episode you don‚Äôt want to miss.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Katheryn Huff\n5:15 - Fusion v. Fission\n6:47 - Does Nuclear Energy Need a Rebrand? \n11:50 - How Clean is Nuclear Energy?\n15:26 - The New Consumers: Data Centers \n18:50 - New Nuclear Technology\n28:48 - Recycling Nuclear Fuel\n39:30 - Accidents &amp; The Fear Factor\n41:50 -  Will There Be Nuclear Reactors in Every Home? \n48:30 - A Cosmic Perspective\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks ‚Ä¶. good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven‚Äôt always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 ‚Äî and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had ‚Ä¶ varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods ‚Äî but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere‚Äôs VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren‚Äôt going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.\n\nPBS Member Stations rely on viewers like you.

From the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome‚Äôs port city of Ostia to local shrines and colossal structures like the Pantheon, the ancient Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods, some local and others imported from across the Mediterranean.\n\nOne key feature of Roman religion was its ability to adapt and innovate. New gods were welcomed into the Roman pantheon, often from the peoples Rome conquered or traded with, such as the Egyptian goddess Isis, who became immensely popular by the Imperial period and received a large temple in the Campus Martius. Another example is Mithras, a mysterious god with Persian origins whose worship involved secret underground rituals and appealed particularly to Roman soldiers.\n\nPublic temples were monumental structures that marked sacred spaces. They served both religious and practical functions, often housing libraries, halls, and spaces for the public to gather. Temples were dedicated to the well-being of the state, such as the Temple of Saturn, which doubled as the city treasury, or the Temple of Castor and Pollux, linked to military victories.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn‚Äôt stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It‚Äôs an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we‚Äôre not worried now, when should we be? \n\n\nSupport our work.

They also don‚Äôt change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.\n\nFingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person ‚Äî the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we‚Äôve previously known. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\n‚ÄúUnveiling intra-person fingerprint similarity via deep contrastive learning,‚Äù by Gabe Guo et al. \nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi0329\n\n‚ÄúThe developmental basis of fingerprint pattern formation and variation,‚Äù by James D.
