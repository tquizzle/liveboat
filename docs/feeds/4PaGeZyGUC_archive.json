Male circumcision is done for religious, cultural or medical reasons.\n\nIn Africa, the WHO used male circumcision in the fight against AIDS. But more and more doctors say that the harm done by the procedure outweighs any medical benefits, and that this surgery is performed far too often.\nThose affected are increasingly daring to go public, demanding that boys, too, be protected from circumcisions that are not medically necessary. Advocates say their right to physical integrity must be preserved. \nBut few take it as far as Florian. He‚Äôs sure that his circumcision as a child wasn‚Äôt medically necessary. Moreover, his parents were not informed about alternative options. He‚Äôs taking his case to court.\nThe film explores the question of when circumcision actually makes  medical sense, and critically questions the ethics of this millennia-old practice.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #circumcision\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

His shoes were custom made for him by the late Vivienne Westwood, his jacket was by Simon Porte Jacquemus, his necklace, Cartier.\n\nWhen he sat down to play, arguably only one thing seemed to be missing: a shiny, 9-foot grand piano. But Thibaudet, like many great pianists who have graced our office space, understands the vibe of our beloved little concert series. He knows that the point is not to be playing on the largest piano possible. Instead, he delighted in bringing music by Villa-Lobos, Brahms and Ravel to our diminutive ‚Äî but meticulously groomed ‚Äî upright. And the colors and textures he conjured from that trusty box of wood and wire was unforgettable.\n\nThibaudet begins with a firecracker of a piece from the early 20th century ‚Äî two-minutes of effervescence by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Watch the pianist‚Äôs fingers in a blur, stabbing hundreds of notes like a sewing machine. It was an encore favorite of the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Thibaudet explains.    \n\nWhat follows could not be more different. The Intermezzo Op. 118, No. 2, is classic late Brahms, filled with muted, fall afternoon light and whispered inner voices. Thibaudet ends with a tribute to one of his idols, Maurice Ravel, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated far and wide. Turns out that one of the composer‚Äôs biggest hits, the Pavane for a Dead Princess, was not among his own favorites. And the evocative title was merely tacked on as a poetic afterthought. Still, the wide palette of coloring and shading Thibaudet offers is a masterclass in how to make an upright piano sound like a symphony orchestra. \n\nSET LIST\nHeitor Villa-Lobos: ‚ÄúO polichinelo‚Äù (from A prole do beb√™ No. 1)\nJohannes Brahms: Intermezzo in A major, Op. 118, No. 2\nMaurice Ravel: Pavane pour une infante d√©funte\n\nMUSICIANS\nJean-Yves Thibaudet: piano\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Tom Huizenga\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Andie Heuther\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Alant√© Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #jeanyvesthibaudet</article>","contentLength":2472,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/jlv4wrfKl4Y?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sprint Qualifying Highlights | 2025 Chinese Grand Prix","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imMbPxcL8NY","date":1742547074,"author":"FORMULA 1","guid":449,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Catch up on qualifying for our first Sprint of the 2025 season, featuring some big surprises in all three stages.\n\nFor more F1¬Æ videos, visit https://www.Formula1.com\n\nFollow F1¬Æ:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/F1\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Formula1/\nhttps://www.twitter.com/F1\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/formula1\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@f1\n\n#F1</article>","contentLength":335,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/imMbPxcL8NY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why BP Learned to Love Oil Again","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EEzLHVpOYg","date":1742544000,"author":"Bloomberg Originals","guid":14,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Following environmental catastrophe, corporate missteps and plain bad luck, BP lags its peers.

The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom‚Äù.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

While social media has helped tourism boom and brought prosperity to the region, it also poses a threat to the landscape and its unique historical heritage.\n\nCappadocia draws more than four million tourists every year. The region in Turkey is famous for its extraordinary \"fairy chimneys\" - carved-out boulders, some of which are still inhabited. This wonderland became a UNESCO World Heritage Site decades ago.\nEvery day, hot air balloons carrying tourists drift across valleys dotted with \"fairy chimneys.\" The rock formations, the hot air balloons, the sunrise - the setting couldn't be more instagrammable.\nMustafa K√∂se knows exactly how to get the perfect shot that tourists want for their social media posts. \"Cultural tourism is dead,\" the photographer says - all people want now is something to show off with on Instagram. It's a development he struggles with, even though he makes a decent living giving the tourists what they want. \nZehra Demircan took over her father's \"cave hotel\" a couple of years ago. He did his best to preserve the family's \"fairy chimneys\" in their original state so that the accommodation still provides an authentic glimpse of Cappadocia. Zehra Demircan is following suit, modernizing the hotel as carefully as possible. Like Mustafa K√∂se, she sometimes feels conflicted about her visitors. \"We had a group here who didn't visit anything for the entire week,\" she says. \"The whole time, they just took photos for social media.\"\nLocal activist M√ºkremin Tokmak has been fighting for years against the destruction of this unique landscape. He was appalled by the construction of a highway cutting through the historical region, paving the way for even more tourism. He documents the effects of the construction work on the valleys and the old churches that stood here. He hasn't given up hope that tourism can be held in check. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cappadocia #instagram #turkey \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio answer fan questions about particle colliders, time travel, and what existed before the Big Bang. \n\nThe discussion begins with the Superconducting Super Collider ‚Äì the massive Texas project that could have revolutionized particle physics in the US if it hadn‚Äôt been canceled. How might scientific breakthroughs have been different if the collider had been completed? Neil explains how the cancellation shifted the epicenter of particle physics to Europe and what that meant for the discovery of the Higgs boson.\n\nFrom there, they explore the big questions: What existed before the Big Bang? Could we ever accelerate time to visit the past? We explore the multiverse, time dilation, and the poetic nature of scientific inquiry. Along the way, they discuss how science poses better questions rather than always finding answers, with nods to Isaac Newton and Star Trek‚Äôs influence on popular culture.\n\nAre we made of stardust? Neil breaks down the cosmic origins of the elements in our bodies and what the future of human evolution might hold. Plus, they confront the mind-bending concept of infinity and whether there‚Äôs any evidence of parallel universes.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Grab Bag\n01:43 - What Happened to the Superconducting Supercollider? \n12:02 - Would We Have Detected Higgs Sooner?\n14:48 - What Existed Before the Big Bang? \n22:12 - Can We Slow Down or Speed Up Time? \n33:27 - Is There Stardust in the Air We Breathe?\n39:17 - Instances of Infinity\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

The French singer-songwriter blends chanson fran√ßaise, R&amp;B and pop with a punk-ish je ne sais quoi. You may have seen her perform during the closing ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics, but her vulnerability and experimentation makes Yseult a no-brainer for our Tiny stage.\n\nThe vigorous set kicks off with two hauntingly beautiful tracks, \"SUICIDE\" and \"MTV.\" Yseult then offers a glimpse of an unreleased song, \"PROBLEMATIC,\" followed by the upbeat \"CUTE,\" which coaxes the crowd with its playful, yet smooth groove.

But in Germany, almost all the country‚Äôs natural peatlands have been drained. Now, they‚Äôre emitting greenhouse gases. People around the world are currently working to rewet the moors - while keeping them usable for agriculture.\n\nDry peatlands are responsible for seven percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Taken together, all the moorland areas in Germany cover over 1.5 million hectares. However, much of this moorland has given way to pasture and arable land over the centuries. Drained, the moors lose their ability to store greenhouse gases. In Germany alone, they could store about as much carbon as the entire German forest - but they must remain wet.\n\nScientists Greta Gaudig and Sabine Wichmann from the \"Greifswald Moor Centrum‚Äù are working on a strategy to rewet the moors, while keeping them usable for agriculture. To accomplish this, they are testing the cultivation of peat mosses and cattails. These materials could be used to produce environmentally friendly potting soil and building materials. This way, farmers could continue generating income while saving the moors.\n\nIn Bristol, young entrepreneurs are producing a sustainable down substitute using cattails. With success: because the product is selling well, several farmers in England are converting their drained fields back to wet moorland for farming. For the first time, they have found a way to protect the moors and continue to make a living from their land.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #climatechange #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children.

In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade‚Äôs and James‚Äôs civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. \n\nThe documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. \n\nMaterial for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.\n\nDirected by Dan Reed\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.\n\nThe book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the \"fighting animals\" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.\n\nFinally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n07:40 Who's \"Optimizing Cloud Native Java\" for?\n09:29 Performance tuning: Art &amp; science\n21:43 Java performance\n32:21 Concurrency in modern Java\n39:10 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBen Evans &amp; Jim Gough ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Cloud Native Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41nivD9\nBen Evans, Jason Clark &amp; David Flanagan ‚Ä¢ Java in a Nutshell ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43FDoMA\nBen Evans, Martijn Verburg &amp; Jason Clark ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41JMG7N\nBen Evans, Jim Gough &amp; Chris Newland ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4bNOfGh\nBen Evans &amp; Martijn Verburg ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4hs9MWk\nGoetz, Peierls, Bloch, Bowbeer, Holmes &amp; Lea ‚Ä¢ Java Concurrency in Practice ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4215zo6\nVenkat Subramaniam ‚Ä¢ Cruising Along with Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4dFuBwU\nMonica Beckwith ‚Ä¢ JVM Performance Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PerformanceEngineering #JVM #JVMPerformanceEngineering #Observability #HardwareInnovation #Java #JavaProgramming #JavaPerformance #JavaConcurrency #Concurrency #CloudNative #CloudNativeJava #GraalVM #Quarkus #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #BenEvans #Kittylyst #HollyCummins #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.\n \nFor months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.\n \nDW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.\n\n[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute for Neuroscience.

So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).\n\nWe'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn!

He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn‚Äôt wear gold.\n\nThen, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe‚Äôs expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.\n\nNext, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter‚Äîcould it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what‚Äôs been eluding us.\n\nPlus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself‚Äîwhat would happen if we were hit by one? Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy?

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.\n\nThe young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin‚Äôs high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.\n\nJustin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.\n\nConor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he‚Äôs running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.\n\nDespite the government‚Äôs promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ireland  #housing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be stopped with known measures.  \n\nFor many people, like C√©sar Serrano, it was as if time had stopped, ‚Äúit's as if a huge storm has come and wiped out everything. Everything is completely deserted, lifeless, closed.‚Äù \n\nIt felt like something out of a disaster movie. First came the fear of this unknown virus, followed by lockdowns. Once the first wave had passed, restrictions in some places were eased. Then came further waves and restrictions, but people got used to the changes in their daily life.  \n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, expressions of solidarity, seen at the start, gave way to frustration and anger. People took to the streets in anti-government protests and conspiracy theories spread.

Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ‚ÄùShould I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?‚Äù There‚Äôs no simple answer, but there‚Äôs a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it‚Äôs below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&amp;P 500. If your debt ‚Äî like a mortgage or a student loan ‚Äî falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You‚Äôll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nHow to Prioritize Retirement Savings vs. Debt Payoff, Bill Fay\nhttps://www.debt.org/retirement/prioritize-savings-vs-payoff/\n\nShould you pay down debt or invest?, Fidelity\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/pay-down-debt-vs-invest\n\nDebt Destroyer, a US government online tool to help make a plan to eliminate debt\nhttps://finred.usalearning.gov/debt-destroyer-calculator/debt-destroyer-calculator.html\n\nNote: The title of this video has been updated\nPrevious title: When it's okay to wait to pay off debt\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Near the beginning of the year, US authorities announced that they‚Äôd charged Lee with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. They alleged that, as the co-founder of a company called HyperVerse, he‚Äôd orchestrated a cryptocurrency scam that bilked investors around the world for almost $2 billion. HyperVerse had promised returns as high as 1% a day via cutting-edge blockchain-based strategies, but according to the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was just an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme.

It‚Äôs often a long way to travel to see a doctor, and treatment is expensive. But an organization from Germany is providing those affected with orthopedic aids, as well as training specialists.\n\nIn Uganda, people with disabilities not only often live in great poverty, there‚Äôs also hardly any medical care available to them. For more than 10 years now, an organization from Usingen in the German state of Hesse has been providing people with prostheses and other orthopedic aids. In the small town of Kiyunga near the capital Kampala, ProUganda has set up a center with a modern orthopedic workshop and treatment rooms.\nBut not everyone can get there: The roads are uneven and it‚Äôs difficult for poor families to get to Kiyunga with their children. That‚Äôs why the team travels to rural areas in minibuses. In the trunk: wheelchairs, some delivered second-hand from Germany, some bought with donations.\nThe film accompanies members of the aid organization as they work with patients in Kiyunga, in the workshop and on missions in the region.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #uganda #medical #africa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We know computers are bad at generating randomness, therefore much effort has been put into finding strategies to do this reliably and securely. These strategies can range from clever, to complex, to just outright silly.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover a research project that aims to answer the question of whether an ant colony can serve as a source for seeding OpenSSL's random number generator. The process, challenges, and findings will be candidly discussed, with something in this presentation for everyone to take away.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.\n\nTo many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. \n\nThe public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn‚Äôt see his family for months so as not to infect them.\n\nWhen the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nBy now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aur√©lie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aur√©lie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.\n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #coronavirus #pandemic \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

That‚Äôs not new.\n\nSupport our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOn the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump‚Äôs order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges ‚Äî but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it‚Äôs uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it‚Äôs very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today‚Äôs concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They‚Äôre actually not.\n\n00:00 A rule\n2:23 Jus soli\n3:13 Dred Scott\n4:46 The 14th Amendment\n8:02 Wong Kim Ark\n10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nGarrett Epps‚Äôs law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you‚Äôll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1607&amp;context=aulr\n\nThe Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf\n\nThe 1861 map of the US we use a few times in the piece is itself a strikingly rich document that I could stare at forever: https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701sm.gct00482/?sp=33\n\nSome other original documents we use in the piece:\n\nTrump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02007.pdf\n\nThe Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf\n\nThe Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson‚Äôs letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/veto-message-438\n\nCongress‚Äôs debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/congress-39-session-1-part-1.pdf\n\nThe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000/pdf/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000.pdf\n\nThe Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep169/usrep169649/usrep169649.pdf\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as ‚Äúthe magic intelligence in the sky.‚Äù OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.\n\nBut whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we‚Äôre building is only beginning.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.

The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn‚Äôt have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.\n\nWe visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.\n\nFor those who couldn‚Äôt afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas‚Äîmulti-story buildings in Rome‚Äîrelied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.\n\nFish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.</article>","contentLength":2898,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/utTF7dXcxfQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neil & a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM","date":1741114490,"author":"StarTalk","guid":232,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.\n\nWe begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.\n\nFusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches‚Äîfrom Princeton‚Äôs tokamak designs to Livermore‚Äôs laser-driven experiments‚Äîand why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.\n\nBut fusion isn‚Äôt just about energy‚Äîit‚Äôs also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.\n\nFinally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs?

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen.

Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth.
