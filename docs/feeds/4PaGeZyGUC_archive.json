The name can be roughly translated as \"cold place.\" The film tells the story of three women: the farmer Hanna, the postwoman Maria and the biologist Nelya.\n\nIn the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, the three protagonists must grapple with their social reality - and loneliness. Very few young people live here, but the elderly women are deeply rooted to their village and its surroundings. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.\n\nIn a tiny kitchen, Hanna shares her feelings of loneliness with the filmmakers, who she says remind her of her deceased sons. At the village post office, post woman Maria has neither stamps nor heating, but customers are warmed with liquor and songs. Somewhere in the woods and caves, biologist Nelya looks for the animal droppings that are a treasure to her. The film portrays an unknown place at the heart of Europe, where people make a daily choice - stay or leave?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!\n\nIs humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?\n\nNext, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity‚Äôs urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. What happens to a photon‚Äôs energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe‚Äôs edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck‚Äôs constant would do to the universe. \n\nWas human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity‚Äôs ultimate motivator?\n\nCould alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made \"Matrix\"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?\n\nFinally, we explore humanity‚Äôs potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their \"Matrix\"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Chuck and Gary‚Äôs Burning Questions\n01:43 - Are We Going to Merge with Machine?\n06:41 - Redshifting to Infinity\n07:59 - If You Could Change Physics\n12:28 - Could We Have Gone to the Moon in 1700? \n21:45 - AI & Energy\n24:51 - How We Use Electrons as a Wave\n28:41 - Are The Aliens Trapped in the Matrix?\n33:19 - Does Physics Prevent Us From Living Forever? \n36:07 - Communicating with Aliens\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century.

They‚Äôre concerned by the issue of animal welfare. But a primary motive is the ecological impact of industrial livestock farming.\n\nIndustrial livestock farming is responsible for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It also requires huge amounts of land and water and is thought to be contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. This is why more and more scientists and entrepreneurs are conducting research on alternatives to conventional meat production.\n\nIn California, Joshua Tetrick is working on a method of growing meat in a bioreactor. He multiplies the muscle cells of chickens in huge tanks and cultivates them with plant-based nutrients. The resulting cell pulp is molded into fibrous meat with the help of a plant scaffold. A kilo still costs many hundreds of dollars. But Joshua Tetrick hopes that production can be scaled up to a globally relevant level. After all, with ‚ÄòGood Meat‚Äô he was one of the first two companies in the USA to receive a license for cultured meat.\n\nAt the University of California, Alison Van Eenennaam is trying to make meat production more efficient.  Using the gene editing tool CRISPR she‚Äôs altered the genetic make-up of a cow so that its offspring are exclusively male. This is a great advantage, as male calves grow faster and consume fewer resources than female calves to produce the same amount of meat - thereby reducing the carbon footprint of livestock farming. \n\nFor Pasi Vainikka from ‚ÄòSolar Foods‚Äô in Helsinki, these are all just intermediate steps on the way to a truly sustainable future food: he‚Äôs cultivating a whole new category of food in gigantic fermenters: Bacteria that are fed with CO2 and hydrogen and blended to create a product called ‚ÄòSolein‚Äô. A flavorless, protein-rich basic ingredient that can replace eggs and milk in practically all foods.\n\nScience journalist Ingolf Baur meets some of the researchers and entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to industrial livestock farming around the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the last decade of my career however, I have been focusing much more on experience design - and engaging people and communities away from technology. I have been studying how to engage people and draw them into a community or conversation - curating every detail across multiple touchpoints including what people see, hear, smell, taste‚Äìand above else‚Äìfeel.\n\nExperience design is critical to designing digital experiences and innovative new products. But it can also be used to explore better workplace policies, better experiences for employees, and even shape creative career paths.\n\nTogether, we‚Äôll explore how experience designers are able to explore new ways of addressing the problems their people face.

In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. \n\nDespite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. \n\n2024 had much of the world voting for change.

What is important, and what can go? The better storage options become, the more difficult it is to answer this question.\n\nWe humans like to preserve everything, whether we‚Äôve collected or created it. Be it sourdough starters, books or blood samples. We want to preserve objects, memories and even microorganisms. \n\nKarl de Smedt is the only sourdough librarian in the world. In St. Vith, Belgium, he keeps 144 sourdough starters from all over the globe, some of which are over 100 years old. Through his collection, he preserves the unique wild yeasts and microorganisms that create each sourdough. \n\nThe German National Library in Leipzig and Frankfurt preserves copies of all books, records and media published in or about Germany since 1913. There are 34 million physical media on the shelves. Digitization can solve the space problem, but also has its pitfalls. For example: data has to be constantly copied, as hard disks can become unusable.\n\nProf. Robert Grass from ETH Zurich is developing a particularly promising storage medium: DNA storage. It is extremely powerful, can be stored for over 1,000 years and can always be read. Data is converted into the DNA code and stored as artificial DNA.\n\nBioBank Dresden stores tumor samples, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid for research purposes. Evidence from criminal offenses is stored in the evidence room of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt am Main. This allows crimes to be re-analyzed using modern techniques and solved decades later.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Some of these ‚Äúmosts‚Äù are genuine testaments to human strength, endurance, creativity, and spirit, while others, are not so much.\n\nTo read more about historic 'mosts', go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/whoa-historical-mosts-/melissa-sartore\n\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/8o4PEJ3bxIY?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Christmas songs but its by rappers | Christmas Special | CHILLAF","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLaVxOA6rqU","date":1735137929,"author":"CHILLAF","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"SUB FOR MORE HOLIDAY SPECIALS!!!!!\nclick for more chill! https://linktr.ee/CHILLAF\nTRACKLIST BELOW!!!!\n\nSpectre Kendricks Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lQalWIp6tE\n\nCookin Soul MF DOOM Xmas https://youtu.be/EwzBjBHfDIs?si=Ry6Uv8iIzMVzAETf\n\nCookin Soul West Coast Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yudw589WC1Y\n\nToasty Digital Kanye Xmas https://youtu.be/7aqDawjezsI?si=XgPacYBuFkkm1urH\n\nToasty Digital Cancel Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C8eLL2QDyU\n\nCookin Soul Xmas in the Bay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikLdXPV6tKg\n\nCookin Soul Biggie Xmas https://youtu.be/b61WyPilXDg?si=67RHQwaEiQGvSoVI\n\nCookin Soul Tribe Called Quest Xmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45ZFjiABLwI\n\nCookin Soul Wutang Xmas https://youtu.be/7WRNpalBzhA?si=xEDM2DyN4B5cYAbC","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tLaVxOA6rqU?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Building a Domain Specific GenAI Chatbot with Serverless ‚Ä¢ Eric Johnson ‚Ä¢ GOTO 2024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxcZaiPsyo","date":1735131643,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttps://gotochgo.com\n\nEric Johnson - Principal Developer Advocate for Serverless at AWS\n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/edjgeek.bsky.social\nhttps://twitter.com/edjgeek\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/singledigit\nhttps://serverlessland.com\n\nLinks\nhttps://github.com/aws-samples/domain-specific-genai-chatbot-with-serverless\n\nABSTRACT\nNavigating the complexities of Generative AI (GenAI) is made simpler with serverless technologies and API-driven approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs).

Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.\n\nSwitching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy.

Workers endure starvation wages, and toxic materials in the jewelry endanger customers' health. This film uncovers the origins and production of these items.\n\nChinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu supply the world with trendy jewelry - chunky chains, sparkling earrings, and gold bracelets. Some 6,000 new lines are added every day to the Shein range alone. But behind the glossy fa√ßade lies a harsh reality. In the factories where these pieces are produced, grueling 60-hour workweeks are the norm, encapsulated in China‚Äôs infamous \"9-9-6‚Äù culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While the jewelry is dirt cheap, the workers bear the cost. The risks aren‚Äôt limited to factory conditions; the products themselves often endanger customers. Testing frequently reveals toxic heavy metals and harmful chemicals. Scientists featured in the film unpack the health implications, shedding light on the hidden dangers of this booming industry.\n\nTwo German family businesses, Bijou Brigitte and the Beeline Group, are making significant sales across Europe. Their sustainability reports offer vague promises and little transparency about supply chains, leaving customers in the dark about where and how their trendy jewelry is produced. The film crew traces the steps of the supply chain all the way to China to find out more.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

More than 30,000 people have been freed from its prisons, but a further 100,000 remain missing. Families are desperately searching for their loved ones - including Hind Gharz al Deen, whose son Hussam is missing.\n\nHussam disappeared eight years ago. Together with her younger son Ahmad, Hind visits hospitals, morgues and the notorious Sednaya prison to look for him. The family is one of thousands in Syria clinging to the hope of finding their loved ones alive. In one hospital, photos of recovered bodies cover a wall. Many of the victims are horribly disfigured - a further reason why the search is agonizing for family members.\n\nFor Ahmad, looking for his older brother in Sednaya prison is particularly distressing. He was imprisoned there himself after being arrested in 2018. The horrors he suffered still haunt him: the brutal conditions and the cruel torture. Ahmad recounts his experiences on December 8th, the day he and his fellow inmates were freed. Hind and Ahmad find no trace of Hussam, but they continue to search.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It only has 3,500 inhabitants, but it‚Äôs a geopolitical heavyweight. A border battalion with 600 elite soldiers makes its military presence felt.\n\nThe two 19-year-old recruits David Bratland and Jesper Bruseth are doing their military service in Kirkenes with the ‚ÄòJegerbataljonen GSV‚Äô. The training program for border fighters, around 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, is tough. In winter, temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius are not uncommon here. Added to that, just a few hours of daylight. During orienteering on skis, the recruits don‚Äôt just hone their physical fitness, but also their ability to take responsibility for their own actions. Their task: to monitor the almost 200-kilometer-long border with Russia and - in the event of war - to defend it. Recently, the soldiers have also received heavy weapons training for anti-aircraft and anti-tank defense.\n\nNorway also demonstrates its claim to power and territory by promoting culture on behalf of the West. While David and Jesper cross the snow-covered expanses of the Norwegian tundra on skis, the Russian-born curator of the Barents Spektakel, Yevgeny Goman, is confronted with completely different challenges a few kilometers away on frozen Lake F√∂rstevatne. The central element of the opening show of the art festival - a giant flying dragon - simply won't take off. But, in the end, the opening show the following evening turns out to be a great spectacle against hopelessness.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She presented a tiny piece of 1,300-year-old papyrus with an inscription: \"Jesus said to them: my wife...I dwell with her.‚Äù\n\nDespite its authenticity, the parchment was not recognized by religious authorities. However, two years later, in 2014, a new text was discovered in the British Library in London. It was a bombshell. This text tells of a marital relationship between Jesus and his 'wife,' Mary Magdalene. Could these revelations indicate that the couple had children? \n  \nThis documentary uses animation to bring clues to life, while taking a new scientific look at the question of whether or not Jesus might have had children. The film examines apocryphal relics -- from recently discovered tombs to ancient parchments. It analyzes inscriptions and the results of scientific tests. The aim is to shed light on one of the oldest mysteries in the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They argue for a strong economy that can allow us to invest in new, sustainable technologies that can help us slash our carbon footprint in the long run. \n\nWhat do you think is the best way out of the climate crisis? \n\nWatch the documentary on our channel. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #climateaction \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/sMLSrN2Lqk8?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Insane Biology of: The Lion","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HWoXR8Qe4w","date":1734788700,"author":"Real Science","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Gift a lifetime or yearly membership to Nebula here:\nhttps://go.nebula.tv/gift?ref=realscience\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/realscience-the-insane-biology-of-the-lion\n\nPatreon: (https://www.patreon.com/realscience)\nInstagram: (https://www.instagram.com/stephaniesammann)\n\nImages Courtesy of Getty Images\n\nThanks to Dr. Craig Packer for his incredible insight on the subject of lion sociality. \nhttps://cbs.umn.edu/lion-research-center\n\nThanks to our Patreon Supporters:\nEric Ypsilantis\nRobert Thompson\nKeith Skipper\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/lions-europe/\n[2] https://www.su.se/english/news/sparta-the-28-000-year-old-cave-lion-1.566145#:~:text=The%20cave%20lion%20was%20one,extinct%20about%2014%2C000%20years%20ago.\n[3] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmor.21627\n[4] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17552741/\n[5] https://cbs.umn.edu/lion-research-center/all-about-lions/frequently-asked-questions\n[6] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12193785/\n[7] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1500391\n[8] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212000632\n[9] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109564331100033X\n[10] https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25479\n[11] https://cbs.umn.edu/lion-research-center/all-about-lions/frequently-asked-questions\n[12] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00170175\n[13] https://cbs.umn.edu/lion-research-center/lion-research/group-living#:~:text=Why%20do%20lions%20live%20in,feed%20better%20in%20larger%20groups.\n[14] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347216000166?via%3d Ihub\n[15] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1009-y\n[16] https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroanatomy/articles/10.3389/fnana.2016.00099/full\n[17] https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0905309106","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/1HWoXR8Qe4w?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Learning in Product: How Wrong are You Ready to Be? ‚Ä¢ David Hussman ‚Ä¢ YOW! 2017","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZpuCHQXPCk","date":1734786053,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2017. #GOTOcon #YOW\nhttps://yowcon.com\n\nDavid Hussman - Software Maker\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile many #Scrum teams talk proudly about progress, fewer engage is rich discuss about product.

Bubbling with excitement, she extended her hand, introduced herself and complimented my outfit with genuine warmth. You‚Äôd think this was one of her first ‚Äúbig time‚Äù gigs, not a regular performance for a pop veteran, having sold out arenas across the country touring her now six time Grammy-nominated sixth album, Short n‚Äô Sweet. That humility made me love her even more. \n\nBut Carpenter delivers far more than just charm in this performance. Backed by her band, complimented with pedal steel and a string quartet, she reimagines her biggest hits from Short n‚Äô Sweet, while sharing the stories in between songs of how these tracks came to life. Opening with ‚ÄúTaste,‚Äù strings serve up some playful pizzicato, before Carpenter and her band move into a lush, soulful version ‚ÄúBed Chem.‚Äù Then everyone swaps their electric instruments for acoustic to perform ‚ÄúPlease Please Please‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlim Pickins.‚Äù Finally, Carpenter closes with the viral favorite ‚ÄúJuno,‚Äù cheekily asking the audience, ‚ÄúHave you ever tried this one?‚Äù before sweeping her rear end across the windchimes, earning a laugh from the room. \n\n‚ÄúWhen I first started [writing songs] it was kinda in a room like this ‚Äî a room with very dry walls and there‚Äôs no reverb,‚Äù Carpenter reflects at the top of her performance. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs something so real and special.‚Äù That authenticity set the tone for a memorable session with one of 2024‚Äôs biggest breakout superstars.\n\nSET LIST\n‚ÄúTaste‚Äù\n‚ÄúBed Chem‚Äù\n‚ÄúPlease Please Please‚Äù\n‚ÄúSlim Pickins‚Äù\n‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù\n‚ÄúJuno‚Äù\n\nMUSICIANS\nSabrina Carpenter: vocals\nHaeun ‚Äúhani‚Äù You: piano, keyboards\nCaleb Nelson: guitar\nMatt Park: pedal steel guitar\nChris Johnson: drums\nAlexandra Simpson: viola\nSarena Hsu: violin\nYasmeen ‚ÄúYAS‚Äù Al-Mazeedi: violin\nBobby Wooten III: bass\nMarza Merophi Wilks: cello\nChristine Noel Smit: background vocals\nMIA MOR: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Ashley Pointer, Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Wendy Li\nAudio Engineer: David Greenburg\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #sabrinacarpenter #espresso #nprmusic \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Better Help, committed to helping clients with issues ranging from relationship challenges and goal-setting to grief and depression.

Cyberbullies engage in a series of campaigns intended to provoke an intense emotional reaction from the victim. The film explores some of their most perfidious methods.\n\nTens of thousands of people have an Internet-based hobby. A cruel game that plays on online anonymity and looks something like this: Cyberbullies home in on victims through social media channels and begin goading them into online emotional outbursts. And clock up each one of these outbursts as a triumph.\n\nThe group profiled in the film has a hierarchical structure and calls itself the NWO, an abbreviation for \"New World Order‚Äù or also \"Nie Wieder Online‚Äù, or \"Never Again Online‚Äù. Members meet on the communication platform Discord, allocate their tasks and brag about their activities online. Some hack accounts to access personal data, others order pizzas or packages en masse in the name of the victims.\n\n*[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

That George Washington owned enslaved people who were Muslim? And that a Muslim diplomat broke his Ramadan fast in the White House in 1805? These are some of the facts that Aymann Ismail (staff writer, Slate Magazine) discovers as he explores the role that Muslims played in the imagination of America‚Äôs founding generation. Aymann‚Äôs journey takes him from George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon to Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs Monticello but begins in the Library of Congress. Here he sees two books that symbolize the promise and contradictions of the early Republic; Jefferson‚Äôs copy of the Qur‚Äôan and an autobiography written by an enslaved African Muslim, Omar Ibn Said, who was brought to the United States during Jefferson‚Äôs presidency.  Through these books, Ayman discovers how some Muslims were included in the founders‚Äô vision of religious freedom in the nascent Republic, while other Muslims were denied all their rights, because of their race and legal status. \n\nThe film features interviews with Keith Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress,) Denise A. Spellberg (author of Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs Qur‚Äôan: Islam and the Founders), and Jeffrey Einboden (author of Jefferson‚Äôs Muslim Fugitives: The Lost Story of Enslaved Africans, their Arabic Letters, and an American President). \n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Learn more about Vancouver at findyourrefresh.com. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nMovie magic is what makes our favorite films so good: Actors flawlessly inhabiting the personalities of totally made-up characters, visual effects transforming a green screen to an otherworldly setting, musical scores making us feel every emotion under the sun. But there‚Äôs another kind of magic we don‚Äôt talk about as much: one physical location masquerading as another. And it happens all the time.\n\nWhen filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn‚Äôt as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and ‚Äî perhaps most importantly ‚Äî one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nThis is especially true for holiday movies ‚Äî many of which are filmed in Canada. In this video, we talk to a prolific Christmas movie producer ‚Äî who has worked on films like 2024‚Äôs Netflix hit Hot Frosty ‚Äî about shooting movies in Canada. \n\nCorrection: In a previous version of this video we mistakenly said that Clark Kent's farm in the TV show Smallville was in Kentucky at :58 and 1:13. The Kent family farm was actually in Kansas. We've corrected the error.  \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nSupport our work.

Coming in the wake of a state investigation that found a broad cascade of failures, ‚ÄúMaui‚Äôs Deadly Firestorm‚Äù investigates critical missteps that day ‚Äî and in the years prior, as the county and state were repeatedly advised to invest more money in prevention and preparedness, and as experts and residents raised concerns.\n\nThe documentary draws on harrowing footage filmed by those in the path of the inferno and firsthand accounts from survivors, victims‚Äô families and friends, first responders, and local and state authorities. Through these accounts as well as a detailed analysis of over a thousand 911 calls and public records across multiple government agencies, it provides a wrenching, moment-by-moment reconstruction of the fire and its aftermath. \n\nThe film also examines how changes to the climate and landscape have made Maui increasingly vulnerable to fires and raises difficult questions about what led to the fire‚Äôs heavy toll.\n\n‚ÄúMaui‚Äôs Deadly Firestorm‚Äù is a FRONTLINE production with Mandarin Duck Films LLC.

By emphasizing the creation of tailored, flexible tools, Girba presents a way to reduce the friction of working with complex systems and legacy code. He explores how contextualized tools, such as those provided by the Glamorous Toolkit, allow developers to engage with software environments in a more intuitive and efficient manner.\n\nThe integration of generative AI is also examined, where Girba argues that AI's true potential lies not in providing definitive answers but in assisting developers by generating hypotheses and creating tools that support deeper engagement with code. Additionally, the concept of \"habitability\" is introduced, proposing that software systems, like physical spaces, should be navigable and comprehensible to developers, fostering a more productive and enjoyable experience.\n\nThis vision of a future where software systems are more accessible and adaptable reflects the growing need to rethink how we interact with code, empowering developers with the tools and perspectives necessary to navigate increasingly complex digital landscapes.

In 2013, Katie Crutchfield, sporting baby bangs, performed her bare-boned, devastating songs alone with her eyes mostly closed. \"I rolled out of the tour band ‚Ä¶ I sort of didn't really know what I was doing at all. My amp broke in the middle [of the set],\" Crutchfield says of her 2013 performance.\n\nAnd while she was already earning her place as one of the most profound lyricists of the 21st century, much has changed since then for the now Grammy-nominated artist. Across Crutchfield's six albums as Waxahatchee, plus country duo Plains, she's strayed from her DIY punk roots and settled into something more akin to Americana.\n\nIn this Tiny Desk concert, Crutchfield is cool and cozy behind the Desk; she sways with an easy smile as she kicks off the set with her latest single, \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" alongside a five-piece band. She performs one of NPR Music's best songs of 2024, \"Right Back To It,\" as well as Tigers Blood's title track and an album standout, \"Crowbar.\" She and the band end with \"Fire,\" a song that, as the first single from 2020's Saint Cloud, marked the beginning of a beautiful transformation of Waxahatchee's music.\n\n\"I'm really happy that that exists,\" Crutchfield says of her 2013 Tiny Desk. \"And I'm really happy to be back to show you this new version of the band.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Much Ado About Nothing\"\n\"Right Back to It\"\n\"Crowbar\"\n\"Tigers Blood\"\n\"Fire\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKatie Crutchfield: vocals, acoustic guitar\nEliana Athayde: upright bass, background vocals\nCole Berggren: piano, banjo\nSpencer Tweedy: drums, background vocals\nColin Croom: pedal steel, dobro, guitar\nClay Frankel: guitar, background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Elle Mannion\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Estefania Mitre\nAudio Engineer: Andie Huether\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Michael Zamora\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#waxahatchee #nprmusic #tinydesk \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Better Help, committed to helping clients with issues ranging from relationship challenges and goal-setting to grief and depression.

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. \n\nBut our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house. \n\nTo  read more about Roman toilets and plumbing, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/ancient-roman-toilets-history/jim-rowley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#ancientrome #plumbing #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9HaCRGeolMc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Winter Chill üéÑ Chill Beats | Lofi Hip Hop [Lofi Beats Music to Enjoy Your Peaceful Evening]","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5l3_28bMsM","date":1734267606,"author":"Chill Melodies","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Winter Chill üéÑ Chill Beats | Lofi Hip Hop [Lofi Beats Music to Enjoy Your Peaceful Evening]\nhttps://youtu.be/h5l3_28bMsM\nüéÑ Welcome to Winter Chill üéÑ Chill Beats | Lofi Hip Hop [Lofi Beats Music to Enjoy Your Peaceful Evening] üéÑ  \n\nEase into your evening with soothing chill beats and calming lofi hip hop tunes.

As AI moves closer to making decisions that impact humanity, how do we regulate and incentivize safety? \n\nSteve highlights the risks of open-source AI, the hardware arms race, and quantum computing‚Äôs potential to amplify existing challenges.

But the endeavours of Alan Turing, Dilly Knox and their colleagues were so top secret that we are only now beginning to learn how they really lived day-to-day in this magnificent house, where ‚Äì behind closed doors, under the cover of darkness, and against the clock - they determined the course of our wartime history. \n\nThe house is also fascinating for what it tells us about how the 10,000 men and women working there would live on a daily basis. Artefacts from a Recreation Club ‚Äì offering activities such as fencing, debating societies and amateur dramatics, amongst others ‚Äì and film showings suggest an atmosphere not dissimilar to an Oxbridge college, and show a more human side to the story of how they developed the Enigma Machine. In this World War Two Season Special, join Dan Snow on an exclusive tour of the house and grounds, as well as the little known but all-important cottages that surround them. Learn about the men and women whose skill and ingenuity saved millions of lives, and about the machine they developed to help them do it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

The TT-33 or ‚ÄòTokarev‚Äô Pistol was named after its designer Fedor Tokarev, and was initially conceived as a modern replacement for the aging Nagant M1895 revolver. The simplicity of its design as well as an improvement in firepower would result in the production of over a million of the pistols by the end of the conflict.\n\nSecond is the Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle, the standard infantry weapon of the Red Army during World War II. Originally designed in 1891, the rifle would undergo several modifications before its M91/30 variant became standard issue for the Soviets. By the time World War Two had broken out, the rifle's ruggedness, reliability, and mass-production capability made it an indispensable weapon for the nation‚Äôs war effort. It was also used by the famous Soviet snipers of the era, including Vasily Zaitsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko.\n\nThird up, the PPSh-41 or ‚ÄòPistolet-Pulemyot Shpagina‚Äô named after its designer Georgy Shpagin. This rapid weapon, capable of firing 1000 rounds per minute, was not simply a stunning submachine gun but a stalwart of the Red Army in World War Two. Adopted as a cost-effective alternative to the PPD-40, the PPSh-41 soon became a symbol of Soviet infantry firepower and played a critical role in the close quarters fighting  that has become synonymous with the sieges and battles of the Eastern Front.\n\nLast but not least is the 'DP', otherwise known as ‚ÄòDegtyaryov‚Äô machine gun. Designed for the Soviet Red Army in the 1920s under the leadership of Vasily Degtyaryov and trialled shortly before the Second World War broke out, the gas-operated DP would prove to be a much relied upon support weapon of the Red Army. Produced 800,000 times across four decades and with a service history that extends to the modern day, the DP proved to be an extremely trustworthy and versatile firearm - with many variations developed for multi-purpose use.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

During the raid, one of the Black Hawk helicopters is shot down and Lechner and his comrades are soon caught up in the fiercest combat involving US forces since the Vietnam War.

That decade brought to life classic unsolved cases such as the murder of Elizabeth Short in The Black Dahlia and the search for the Zodiac Killer in Zodiac. Serial killers were also brought to the big screen such as the story of Aileen Wuornos in Monster and Jeffrey Dahmer in Dahmer, both of which stirred controversy. Although these films may at times stretch the truth, they largely stick to the facts, which are indeed stranger than fiction in most cases. Which are still worth watching decades later, and which are best left forgotten?\n\nTo read more about great movies based off true incidents, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/necromancy-facts/jen-jeffers\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#movies  #truestories #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/fo7dDxnYbR4?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Why every restaurant has the same desserts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtTLUnH5vps","date":1733317240,"author":"Vox","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Desserts at restaurants have gotten boring ‚Äî here‚Äôs why.\n\nThis video is presented by Bluehost. Bluehost doesn‚Äôt influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.\n\nWhen choosing a restaurant you probably look at a few things: What type of food do they serve? How close is it? Maybe if they‚Äôre allergen- or kid-friendly. You‚Äôre very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It‚Äôs a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: ‚ÄúI think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.‚Äù\n\nDesserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor. Oftentimes, dessert isn‚Äôt even on the main menu. Even the menu itself can feel like an afterthought ‚Äî and when it hits the table, you‚Äôre likely staring down the same options you‚Äôve seen hundreds of times before. There‚Äôs a reason for this.
