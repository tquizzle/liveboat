What is important, and what can go? The better storage options become, the more difficult it is to answer this question.\n\nWe humans like to preserve everything, whether we’ve collected or created it. Be it sourdough starters, books or blood samples. We want to preserve objects, memories and even microorganisms. \n\nKarl de Smedt is the only sourdough librarian in the world. In St. Vith, Belgium, he keeps 144 sourdough starters from all over the globe, some of which are over 100 years old. Through his collection, he preserves the unique wild yeasts and microorganisms that create each sourdough. \n\nThe German National Library in Leipzig and Frankfurt preserves copies of all books, records and media published in or about Germany since 1913. There are 34 million physical media on the shelves. Digitization can solve the space problem, but also has its pitfalls. For example: data has to be constantly copied, as hard disks can become unusable.\n\nProf. Robert Grass from ETH Zurich is developing a particularly promising storage medium: DNA storage. It is extremely powerful, can be stored for over 1,000 years and can always be read. Data is converted into the DNA code and stored as artificial DNA.\n\nBioBank Dresden stores tumor samples, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid for research purposes. Evidence from criminal offenses is stored in the evidence room of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt am Main. This allows crimes to be re-analyzed using modern techniques and solved decades later.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice discuss the UAP hearings, unexplained cosmic phenomena, dark matter, and more with astrophysicist and NASA UAP chair David Spergel.\n\nDavid reveals what it’s like to investigate UFOs scientifically, explaining why most sightings turn out to be lens flares or misidentified objects— but also why the 1% of unexplained events still intrigue researchers. Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.\n\nSwitching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy. Learn how groundbreaking tools like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and collaborations with ESA’s Euclid mission aim to answer fundamental questions about the universe.  We discuss computational astrophysics and the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. From UFOs to cutting-edge astrophysics, this episode offers a clear-eyed look at the mysteries of the universe.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: David Spergel\n01:45 - How Much is Unexplained? \n9:07 - The UAP Hearings\n13:51 - Would NASA Keep the Aliens Secret?\n18:28 - Conspiracy & Eyewitness Testimony\n31:19 - Dark Matter & The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope\n40:07 - Star Evolution & Computational Astrophysics\n44:56 - Dark Matter & Dark Energy\n48:39 - Gravitational Waves at the Begining of the Universe\n53:04 - A Cosmic Perspective\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Workers endure starvation wages, and toxic materials in the jewelry endanger customers' health. This film uncovers the origins and production of these items.\n\nChinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu supply the world with trendy jewelry - chunky chains, sparkling earrings, and gold bracelets. Some 6,000 new lines are added every day to the Shein range alone. But behind the glossy façade lies a harsh reality. In the factories where these pieces are produced, grueling 60-hour workweeks are the norm, encapsulated in China’s infamous \"9-9-6” culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While the jewelry is dirt cheap, the workers bear the cost. The risks aren’t limited to factory conditions; the products themselves often endanger customers. Testing frequently reveals toxic heavy metals and harmful chemicals. Scientists featured in the film unpack the health implications, shedding light on the hidden dangers of this booming industry.\n\nTwo German family businesses, Bijou Brigitte and the Beeline Group, are making significant sales across Europe. Their sustainability reports offer vague promises and little transparency about supply chains, leaving customers in the dark about where and how their trendy jewelry is produced. The film crew traces the steps of the supply chain all the way to China to find out more.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

More than 30,000 people have been freed from its prisons, but a further 100,000 remain missing. Families are desperately searching for their loved ones - including Hind Gharz al Deen, whose son Hussam is missing.\n\nHussam disappeared eight years ago. Together with her younger son Ahmad, Hind visits hospitals, morgues and the notorious Sednaya prison to look for him. The family is one of thousands in Syria clinging to the hope of finding their loved ones alive. In one hospital, photos of recovered bodies cover a wall. Many of the victims are horribly disfigured - a further reason why the search is agonizing for family members.\n\nFor Ahmad, looking for his older brother in Sednaya prison is particularly distressing. He was imprisoned there himself after being arrested in 2018. The horrors he suffered still haunt him: the brutal conditions and the cruel torture. Ahmad recounts his experiences on December 8th, the day he and his fellow inmates were freed. Hind and Ahmad find no trace of Hussam, but they continue to search.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It only has 3,500 inhabitants, but it’s a geopolitical heavyweight. A border battalion with 600 elite soldiers makes its military presence felt.\n\nThe two 19-year-old recruits David Bratland and Jesper Bruseth are doing their military service in Kirkenes with the ‘Jegerbataljonen GSV’. The training program for border fighters, around 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, is tough. In winter, temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius are not uncommon here. Added to that, just a few hours of daylight. During orienteering on skis, the recruits don’t just hone their physical fitness, but also their ability to take responsibility for their own actions. Their task: to monitor the almost 200-kilometer-long border with Russia and - in the event of war - to defend it. Recently, the soldiers have also received heavy weapons training for anti-aircraft and anti-tank defense.\n\nNorway also demonstrates its claim to power and territory by promoting culture on behalf of the West. While David and Jesper cross the snow-covered expanses of the Norwegian tundra on skis, the Russian-born curator of the Barents Spektakel, Yevgeny Goman, is confronted with completely different challenges a few kilometers away on frozen Lake Förstevatne. The central element of the opening show of the art festival - a giant flying dragon - simply won't take off. But, in the end, the opening show the following evening turns out to be a great spectacle against hopelessness.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She presented a tiny piece of 1,300-year-old papyrus with an inscription: \"Jesus said to them: my wife...I dwell with her.”\n\nDespite its authenticity, the parchment was not recognized by religious authorities. However, two years later, in 2014, a new text was discovered in the British Library in London. It was a bombshell. This text tells of a marital relationship between Jesus and his 'wife,' Mary Magdalene. Could these revelations indicate that the couple had children? \n  \nThis documentary uses animation to bring clues to life, while taking a new scientific look at the question of whether or not Jesus might have had children. The film examines apocryphal relics -- from recently discovered tombs to ancient parchments. It analyzes inscriptions and the results of scientific tests. The aim is to shed light on one of the oldest mysteries in the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Many teams who become more confident in progress, or getting work done, often embrace the more ambiguous question of product, or “Are we meeting the needs of our customers”, with some customers buying, by paying for subscriptions, and others buying in, by showing (and glowing about) their use of the system.\n\nIn this session, I’ll share experiences helping companies adopt a customer and product / services approach. From small digital product companies to large enterprises who are IT focused, I will present an approach for moving to or augmenting an existing move towards impact driven work.\n\nTopics that will be covered include:\n• mapping teams to #products and services\n• early #ProductDiscovery\n• blending product discovery and #ProductDelivery\n• and if there is enough time, ideas for doing these things at scale.\n\nIf we run out of time, there is always the hallways, where some of the best conversations take place.

Antonio studies at Stanford and comes from a low-income family background. He’s been elected to the local council, where he gives a voice to his neighborhood and his community. Ofelia is one of a group of young residents. During the coronavirus pandemic, the three activists started to push back against what they describe as \"capitalist colonization.” They continue to campaign for those who’ve missed out on the economic miracle of the tech industry that’s sprouted up around them.\n\nWith their activism and creative methods of resistance, the residents of East Palo Alto inspire others to think about the world of tomorrow. They also show that it’s possible to stand up to the Internet giants.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.

Cyberbullies engage in a series of campaigns intended to provoke an intense emotional reaction from the victim. The film explores some of their most perfidious methods.\n\nTens of thousands of people have an Internet-based hobby. A cruel game that plays on online anonymity and looks something like this: Cyberbullies home in on victims through social media channels and begin goading them into online emotional outbursts. And clock up each one of these outbursts as a triumph.\n\nThe group profiled in the film has a hierarchical structure and calls itself the NWO, an abbreviation for \"New World Order” or also \"Nie Wieder Online”, or \"Never Again Online”. Members meet on the communication platform Discord, allocate their tasks and brag about their activities online. Some hack accounts to access personal data, others order pizzas or packages en masse in the name of the victims.\n\n*[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

That George Washington owned enslaved people who were Muslim? And that a Muslim diplomat broke his Ramadan fast in the White House in 1805? These are some of the facts that Aymann Ismail (staff writer, Slate Magazine) discovers as he explores the role that Muslims played in the imagination of America’s founding generation. Aymann’s journey takes him from George Washington’s Mount Vernon to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello but begins in the Library of Congress. Here he sees two books that symbolize the promise and contradictions of the early Republic; Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’an and an autobiography written by an enslaved African Muslim, Omar Ibn Said, who was brought to the United States during Jefferson’s presidency.  Through these books, Ayman discovers how some Muslims were included in the founders’ vision of religious freedom in the nascent Republic, while other Muslims were denied all their rights, because of their race and legal status. \n\nThe film features interviews with Keith Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress,) Denise A. Spellberg (author of Thomas Jefferson’s Qur’an: Islam and the Founders), and Jeffrey Einboden (author of Jefferson’s Muslim Fugitives: The Lost Story of Enslaved Africans, their Arabic Letters, and an American President). \n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric.

Mazen’s body had visible signs of torture and beatings, according to reports. \n\nWatch the full documentary on our channel. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #Syria #MazenAl-Hamada\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/H4_lrKYgFQo?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Facilitating Software Architecture • Andrew Harmel-Law & Sonya Natanzon • GOTO 2024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpFR8qzwYSA","date":1734613246,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub\nhttp://gotopia.tech/bookclub\n\nRead the full transcription of the interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/episodes/348\n\nAndrew Harmel-Law - Technical Principal at Thoughtworks & Author of “Facilitating Software Architecture” @AndrewHarmelLaw \nSonya Natanzon - Senior Director of Software Engineering at Guardant Health @SonyaNatanzon \n\nRESOURCES\nAndrew\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/andrewhl.bsky.social\nhttps://twit.social/@ahl\nhttps://github.com/andrewharmellaw\nhttps://x.com/al94781\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewharmellaw\n\nSonya\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sonya-natanzon\n\nLinks\nhttps://facilitatingsoftwarearchitecture.com\nhttps://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html\nhttps://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records\nhttps://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions\nhttps://medium.com/@vanessamformicola/social-decision-records-adrs-for-human-interactions-e6bb3ffe30ef\nhttps://youtu.be/acqcyX-tpf4\nhttps://youtu.be/Vd5IxWn3Ync\nhttps://youtu.be/H5FZEciOgI8\nhttps://youtu.be/Gs1zUKrFCoY\nhttps://youtu.be/m7cWdYVAzX0\nhttps://youtu.be/dJ8Z-MKqeB8\nhttps://youtu.be/NKQ--vGY35E\nhttps://youtu.be/rIgTE9aDVj4\nhttps://youtu.be/NGXl1D-KwRI\nhttps://youtu.be/sk1NPkAzYSM\nhttps://youtu.be/FbV9EFHnGOE\nhttps://youtu.be/fYWvTYFmVYs\nhttps://youtu.be/HKS5sKsIkkc\nhttps://youtu.be/BIuBnLTMkfQ\nhttps://youtu.be/E5oCgo7cu14\nhttps://youtu.be/dcp6YMAmI3M\nhttps://youtu.be/0nsZ7lA9Znk\n\nDESCRIPTION\nSonya Natanzon and Andrew Harmel-Law explore key concepts from Andrew’s book, fostering decentralized sociotechnical systems, emphasizing the importance of embracing imperfection in decision-making, and combating cognitive biases like the framing effect.\n\nThey highlight the shift to prioritizing learning, adaptability, and small, fast iterations in socio-technical systems. Andrew discusses psychological safety as vital for empowering teams to innovate while maintaining accountability, advocating for experimentation and collective ownership of evolving codebases. Together, they underline the importance of balancing creativity and structure to build resilient, adaptive systems that thrive in complexity.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:40 From blog to book\n06:00 Evolving architectural decision-making\n11:35 Decentralized decision-making\n22:57 The transformative power of writing\n26:58 Balancing decision-making & accountability in software architecture\n32:04 Harnessing reframing & bias awareness for better decisions\n38:02 Psychological safety & accountability in decentralized decision-making\n42:26 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nDonald G.

Learn more about Vancouver at findyourrefresh.com. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nMovie magic is what makes our favorite films so good: Actors flawlessly inhabiting the personalities of totally made-up characters, visual effects transforming a green screen to an otherworldly setting, musical scores making us feel every emotion under the sun. But there’s another kind of magic we don’t talk about as much: one physical location masquerading as another. And it happens all the time.\n\nWhen filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn’t as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nThis is especially true for holiday movies — many of which are filmed in Canada. In this video, we talk to a prolific Christmas movie producer — who has worked on films like 2024’s Netflix hit Hot Frosty — about shooting movies in Canada. \n\nCorrection: In a previous version of this video we mistakenly said that Clark Kent's farm in the TV show Smallville was in Kentucky at :58 and 1:13. The Kent family farm was actually in Kansas.

Relatives from their home countries, such as Iraq, Syria and Egypt, are looking for them. Polish volunteers offer their support in what is often a distressing endeavor.\n\nThe migration route through Belarus to Poland is an established one, despite the presence of a border fence, heavily armed guards and reports of increasing brutality in what is effectively an exclusion zone. Although it may be considered safer than trying to cross the Mediterranean or the Atlantic, people following this route to Europe are also dying with increasing regularity.  \n\nThey perish in the forests and swamps between Poland and Belarus, thousands of kilometers away from their home countries and desperate families who often have no idea what’s happened to their loved ones. But one group of people living in the Podlaskie border region is concerned with the fate of the dead and missing. They try to help the relatives to identify their family members. The film follows the story of Mohammed Sabah’s family, as they try to find what’s happened to him.\n\nMohammed left his home in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Iraq, in the fall of 2021. In November 2021, he got held up in the neutral zone between Poland and Belarus and after a few weeks, was pushed back to Belarus by Polish border guards. Mohammed contacted his family for the last time at the beginning of December. He kept in touch through his uncle Rekaut, who’s lived in London for 15 years. There was no sign of life from Mohammed until October 2022, when a video emerged, allegedly showing Mohammed crossing the border fence into Poland.  \n\nAll hope now lies with Mohammed's uncle Rekaut, who maintains contact with the authorities and NGOs on behalf of the family and goes to Poland whenever he can. In Erbil, Mohammed's family desperately hopes he’s still alive - but at the very least, they just want to know his fate.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Coming in the wake of a state investigation that found a broad cascade of failures, “Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” investigates critical missteps that day — and in the years prior, as the county and state were repeatedly advised to invest more money in prevention and preparedness, and as experts and residents raised concerns.\n\nThe documentary draws on harrowing footage filmed by those in the path of the inferno and firsthand accounts from survivors, victims’ families and friends, first responders, and local and state authorities. Through these accounts as well as a detailed analysis of over a thousand 911 calls and public records across multiple government agencies, it provides a wrenching, moment-by-moment reconstruction of the fire and its aftermath. \n\nThe film also examines how changes to the climate and landscape have made Maui increasingly vulnerable to fires and raises difficult questions about what led to the fire’s heavy toll.\n\n“Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” is a FRONTLINE production with Mandarin Duck Films LLC. The writer, producer and director is Xinyan Yu. The producer is Christina Avalos. The senior producer is Frank Koughan.

He explores how contextualized tools, such as those provided by the Glamorous Toolkit, allow developers to engage with software environments in a more intuitive and efficient manner.\n\nThe integration of generative AI is also examined, where Girba argues that AI's true potential lies not in providing definitive answers but in assisting developers by generating hypotheses and creating tools that support deeper engagement with code. Additionally, the concept of \"habitability\" is introduced, proposing that software systems, like physical spaces, should be navigable and comprehensible to developers, fostering a more productive and enjoyable experience.\n\nThis vision of a future where software systems are more accessible and adaptable reflects the growing need to rethink how we interact with code, empowering developers with the tools and perspectives necessary to navigate increasingly complex digital landscapes.

It has been woven into all aspects of modern software by being presented as a utopian vision: a way of making human lives easier, doing repetitive tasks faster and with fewer errors, freeing us fallible humans up to do other ostensibly more important work. But anyone who has worked directly with automated systems knows that we are still very far from such a dreamy reality.\n\nThis talk delves into detailed research about how automation is involved in software incidents. My focus on this area stems from the growing portrayal of automation as a panacea for various software incident issues, despite its limitations in effectively addressing these challenges, such as reliable detection and resolution of software issues or analyzing and disseminating learnings from these incidents back into the organization and its products and services.\n\nDrawn directly from public incident reports (collected in the VOID), this research revealed multiple, often competing, roles that automation can play over the course of an incident, and most importantly underscored how important humans are at understanding, troubleshooting, and recovering from automated software issues. If you're struggling to convey the reality behind the hype of automation and AI to others on your team or at your organization, this is the talk for you.

However, implementations have veered between two extremes: incredible abstractive power with a steep learning curve; and limited domain-specific uses that can be picked up in minutes. Why can't we have our cake and eat it too?\n\n#Goggles is a new #Scala macro built over the powerful & popular Monocle optics library. It uses Scala's macros and scandalously flexible syntax to create a compiler-checked mini-language to concisely construct, compose and apply optics, with a gentle, familiar interface, and extravagantly informative compiler errors.\n\nIn this talk I'll introduce the motivation for lenses and why usability is a problem that so badly needs solving, and how the #GogglesLibrary, with #Monocle, helps address this in an important way. There'll be some juicy discussion of Scala macro sorcery too!\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSimon Brown • Software Architecture for Developers Vol. 2 • https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture\nDavid Farley • Modern Software Engineering • https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley & Jez Humble • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nWoods, Erder & Pureur • Continuous Architecture in Practice • https://amzn.to/2QWAmkl\nGeorge Fairbanks • Just Enough Software Architecture • https://amzn.to/3uZzVo0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareEngineering #Programming #KenScambler #SoftwareDevelopment #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. \n\nBut our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house. \n\nTo  read more about Roman toilets and plumbing, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/ancient-roman-toilets-history/jim-rowley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#ancientrome #plumbing #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9HaCRGeolMc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How the Bitcoin Protocol Actually Works • Jan Møller • YOW! 2016","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xsut4MQYhg","date":1734267614,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2016. #GOTOcon #YOW\nhttps://yowcon.com\n\nJan Møller - Co-Founder & CTO at Chainalysis\n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-møller-bb32141\nhttps://x.com/jan_moller\n\nABSTRACT\nA solution to a problem that by many scientists was believed impossible to solve was proposed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice & Gary O’Reilly dive into the challenges of designing a future where human values and cutting-edge AI coexist, with The Future of Life Award’s 2024 recipients Batya Friedman and Steve Omohundro.\n\nBatya introduces us to the concept of value-sensitive design and how we can integrate ethics and human values into technological development. We explore unintended consequences and an inventor’s responsibility when they put their work out into the world. Learn how her work has reshaped court systems in Washington State and why human connection remains vital in an increasingly automated world.\n\nSteve explores the promises and perils of artificial intelligence. As AI moves closer to making decisions that impact humanity, how do we regulate and incentivize safety? \n\nSteve highlights the risks of open-source AI, the hardware arms race, and quantum computing’s potential to amplify existing challenges. Can we develop ethical guardrails to prevent AI from becoming a threat? And what role will superhuman AI mathematicians play in designing secure systems?\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Ethics of Technology\n1:33 - Batya Friedman: Value Sensitive Design\n4:38 - Considering Unintended Consequences\n13:46 - Evolving Ethics\n21:25 - Steve Omohundro: Establishing AI Ethics\n26:10 - Embracing Safety Architecture\n29:42 - Quantum Computing & Curtailing Bad Actors\n37:07 - Breaking it Down: Evolving AI With Safety\n\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

But the endeavours of Alan Turing, Dilly Knox and their colleagues were so top secret that we are only now beginning to learn how they really lived day-to-day in this magnificent house, where – behind closed doors, under the cover of darkness, and against the clock - they determined the course of our wartime history. \n\nThe house is also fascinating for what it tells us about how the 10,000 men and women working there would live on a daily basis. Artefacts from a Recreation Club – offering activities such as fencing, debating societies and amateur dramatics, amongst others – and film showings suggest an atmosphere not dissimilar to an Oxbridge college, and show a more human side to the story of how they developed the Enigma Machine. In this World War Two Season Special, join Dan Snow on an exclusive tour of the house and grounds, as well as the little known but all-important cottages that surround them. Learn about the men and women whose skill and ingenuity saved millions of lives, and about the machine they developed to help them do it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

In the pursuit of athletic excellence, the Greeks developed ideas and methods that are still remarkably applicable to the present day. Such fundamental fitness concepts as a proper warm-up and cool-down have their origins in the sandy gymnasiums of Athens and Sparta. While the dress code of the modern gym is a little stricter, the lessons gleaned from those ancient workouts are well worth a look. \n\nTo read more about the ancient Greeks and their approach to fitness, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/workout-secrets-greeks/michael-muir\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#fitness #greek #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2b7uhgltJAM?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Breakdown in Maine (full documentary) | FRONTLINE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX3i_VEIAnw","date":1733886017,"author":"FRONTLINE PBS | Official","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"An investigation into the breakdowns with police, military and mental health care in the lead-up to what became the deadliest mass shooting in Maine’s history.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

The one in October in Lewiston, Maine — where an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 — was the year’s deadliest. \nIn “Breakdown in Maine,” FRONTLINE and its Local Journalism Initiative partners the Portland Press Herald and Maine Public examine a series of missteps by the military, local law enforcement and mental health providers before the tragedy. The documentary probes Maine’s unique gun laws and details the shooter’s brain injuries, possibly sustained during his time as an Army grenade instructor. It also examines the devastating impact of the shooting, including on Maine’s Deaf community, which lost four people that day.\n\n“Whose fault is it? Who do we blame?” asks Megan Vozzella, whose husband, Steve, was killed in the shooting. “It makes me angry. He could have been stopped.”\n\nBreakdown in Maine is a FRONTLINE production with Storyboard Studios LLC.  The director is Bronwyn Berry. The producer is James Blue. The writers are Bronwyn Berry and James Blue. The journalists from the Portland Press Herald are Julia Arenstam and John Terhune; and from Maine Public, Steve Mistler and Susan Sharon.

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOne thing is clear: The roughly 75 million people who voted for Trump were saying “no” to lots of things.\n\nBut what were they saying “yes” to?\n\nIn this excerpt from The Gray Area podcast, Sean Illing and Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp try to figure out whether Trumpism is a movement or just a moment. Is it a political ideology that we’ll reckon with for years to come, or just a collection of whims from the most powerful man in the world? And what does it mean for the country’s political future?\n\nBeauchamp is the author of The Reactionary Spirit: How America's Most Insidious Political Tradition Swept the World.

The TT-33 or ‘Tokarev’ Pistol was named after its designer Fedor Tokarev, and was initially conceived as a modern replacement for the aging Nagant M1895 revolver. The simplicity of its design as well as an improvement in firepower would result in the production of over a million of the pistols by the end of the conflict.\n\nSecond is the Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle, the standard infantry weapon of the Red Army during World War II. Originally designed in 1891, the rifle would undergo several modifications before its M91/30 variant became standard issue for the Soviets. By the time World War Two had broken out, the rifle's ruggedness, reliability, and mass-production capability made it an indispensable weapon for the nation’s war effort. It was also used by the famous Soviet snipers of the era, including Vasily Zaitsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko.\n\nThird up, the PPSh-41 or ‘Pistolet-Pulemyot Shpagina’ named after its designer Georgy Shpagin. This rapid weapon, capable of firing 1000 rounds per minute, was not simply a stunning submachine gun but a stalwart of the Red Army in World War Two. Adopted as a cost-effective alternative to the PPD-40, the PPSh-41 soon became a symbol of Soviet infantry firepower and played a critical role in the close quarters fighting  that has become synonymous with the sieges and battles of the Eastern Front.\n\nLast but not least is the 'DP', otherwise known as ‘Degtyaryov’ machine gun. Designed for the Soviet Red Army in the 1920s under the leadership of Vasily Degtyaryov and trialled shortly before the Second World War broke out, the gas-operated DP would prove to be a much relied upon support weapon of the Red Army.

Bluehost doesn’t influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.\n\nWhen choosing a restaurant you probably look at a few things: What type of food do they serve? How close is it? Maybe if they’re allergen- or kid-friendly. You’re very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It’s a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: “I think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.”\n\nDesserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor. Oftentimes, dessert isn’t even on the main menu. Even the menu itself can feel like an afterthought — and when it hits the table, you’re likely staring down the same options you’ve seen hundreds of times before. There’s a reason for this.

So, is it possible to snuff out these bizarre blazes? And how do they form in the first place?

Sailing in Conrad’s beautiful replica 18th century boat, “Bounty’s End”, they weave their way through a wonderland of history and legend.\n\nIn the second episode, the intrepid pair navigate through these notoriously treacherous waters to investigate stories of shipwrecks and an infamous maritime disaster that changed the history of navigation and unlocked the secrets of longitude!\n\nIn the third and final episode, Dan and Conrad conclude their epic expedition around the Isles of Scilly exploring the impressive defences that line the islands’ coastlines that made them almost impregnable - guarding the Atlantic approaches.\n\nFor hundreds of years, military planners have recognised the strategic importance of the Isles of Scilly. The island’s position at the crossroads of several important sea routes made them a vital asset for Britain.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.
