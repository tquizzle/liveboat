And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity.&nbsp;Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito. Their decisions—some brilliant, others catastrophic—reshaped nations and decided the fate of millions.</p><p>In this gripping mini-series, Dan steps inside the war room and breaks down the key strategic moves made by these infamous leaders, with the help of Phillips O’Brien (esteemed professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews). They examine Hitler’s fateful invasion of Russia, Churchill’s attempts to preserve the British Empire, as well as Roosevelt’s quiet manoeuvring and Hirohito’s cautious influence.</p>","contentLength":1249,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67bf510b6b976c33512d620f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=KgfAEk5M_53WGm6_wyfg4HrFRnyRipxJqloHPuRBaN8","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mary, Queen of Scots","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/queen-of-scots-mary","date":1740529800,"author":"","guid":730,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is the story of the incredible rise and fall of Mary, Queen of Scots.
