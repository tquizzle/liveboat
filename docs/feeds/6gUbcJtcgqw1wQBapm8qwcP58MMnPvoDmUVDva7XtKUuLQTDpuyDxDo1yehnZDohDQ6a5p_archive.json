Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? \n\nIf generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? \n\nIf a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? \n\nToday, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor.

Until now, most developers had to pay a monthly fee, starting at $10 per month, with only verified students, teachers, and open source maintainers getting free access... \n\n\nThere are some limitations to the free version, which is geared toward occasional users, not major work on a big project. Developers on the free plan will get access to 2,000 code completions per month, for example, and as a GitHub spokesperson told me, each Copilot code suggestion will count against this limit &mdash; not just accepted suggestions. And while GitHub recently added the ability to switch between different foundation models, users on the free plan are limited to Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o. (The paid plans also include Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and OpenAI's o1-preview and -mini.) For Copilot Chat, the number of chat messages is limited to 50, but otherwise, there aren't any major limitations to the free service. Developers still get access to all Copilot Extensions and skills. \n\nThe free Copilot SKU will work in a number of editors, including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains, as well as on GitHub.com. \n\nGitHub's announcement ends with the words \"Happy coding!\" and calls the service \"GitHub Copilot Free.\" But TechCrunch points out there's already competition from services like Amazon Q Developer, as well as from companies like Tabnine and Qodo (previously known as Codium) &mdash; and they typically offer a free tier. But in addition, \"With Copilot Free, we are returning to our freemium roots,\" GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told TechCrunch, as well as \"laying the groundwork for something far greater: AI represents our best path to enabling a GitHub with one billion developers. \n\n\"There should be no barrier to entry for experiencing the joy of creating software. Now six years after being acquired by Microsoft, it indeed appears GitHub is still GitHub &mdash; and we are doing our thing.\" \n\nOr, as GitHub CEO Satya Nadella said in a video posted on LinkedIn, \"The joy of coding is back!

The idea of programming seemed exclusively reserved for those fluent in syntax and logic. However, the narrative is now being challenged by natural language coding being implemented in AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla predicted this trend last year.... English is emerging as the universal coding language. \n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes that English is becoming a new programming language thanks to AI advancements. Speaking at the World Government Summit, Huang explained, \"It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human\"... He calls this a \"miracle of AI,\" emphasising how it closes the technology divide and empowers people from all fields to become effective technologists without traditional coding skills... \"In the future, you will tell the computer what you want, and it will do it,\"&#226; Huang commented. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and its successors have made this possible... \n\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has been equally vocal about the potential of English for coding. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, an AI code assistant, enables developers to describe their needs in natural language and receive functional code in response. Nadella describes this as part of a broader mission to \"empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more\".... In a discussion earlier last year, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque claimed, \"41% of codes on GitHub are AI-generated\"... \n\nIn 2024, the ability to program is no longer reserved for a few.

As Rust's adoption continues to accelerate, the demand for a multifaceted ecosystem of quality training will too.\n \n\nTheir blog post highlights three examples of the Rust community \"creating new pathways for learning Rust\" and \"addressing the critical need for Rust training in academic settings...\"\n\n\nRust-Edu operates as a non-profit through Portland State University, with funding from Futurewei. Their mission is to \"spread Rust use and development through academic curricula and communities throughout the world, making Rust the language of choice for 'systems programming' in its broadest sense through shared efforts of faculty, students and the Rust community.\" They focus on three main areas: curriculum development, educational tools, and language improvements... \n\n\nteach-rs, pronounced \"teachers,\" is a modular and reusable university course designed for in-person teaching in Rust. Its mission is to introduce Rust in higher education and ensure that more students enter the job market with considerable Rust experience. The teach-rs project provides ready-to-use Rust teaching materials, including slide decks and exercises that can be adapted to various teaching contexts... As an open source permissively licensed project, teach-rs enables educators to share and improve resources, making introducing Rust instruction into their programs more accessible. Many institutions now use teach-rs in their courses, including the Slovak University of Technology, RustIEC (a collaboration between Vrije Universiteit Brussel and KU Leuven), and the University Politehnica of Bucharest. At the time of this writing, teach-rs has nearly 3000 stars on GitHub... \n\nUnder the guidance of The Rust Foundation's Global Rust Coordinator and Rust Nation UK's organizer Ernest Kissiedu, Mordecai Etukudo (Mart) has developed a guide to help educational institutions adopt Rust in their systems. This resource walks organizations through the entire implementation process, from initial assessment to community engagement.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Rust+Foundation's+Plan+to+Grow+the+Pool+of+Well-Trained+Rust+Developers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2222220%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2222220%2Fthe-rust-foundations-plan-to-grow-the-pool-of-well-trained-rust-developers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2222220/the-rust-foundations-plan-to-grow-the-pool-of-well-trained-rust-developers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Meta Using OpenAI's GPT-4 in Internal Coding Tool Despite Llama Push","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/0033227/meta-using-openais-gpt-4-in-internal-coding-tool-despite-llama-push?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733333640,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Meta is using OpenAI's GPT-4 alongside its own Llama AI model in Metamate, an internal coding assistance tool, Fortune reported Tuesday.
