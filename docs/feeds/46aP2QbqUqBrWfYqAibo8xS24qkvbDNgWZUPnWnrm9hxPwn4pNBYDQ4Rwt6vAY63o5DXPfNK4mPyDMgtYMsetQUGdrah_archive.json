So you can look at each individual part but also at the big picture, which is cell membranes. How do you work in obsidian? What is your workflow? What are some pros and cons?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpWyinDUQxc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpWyinDUQxc</a> -&gt; This is a video of me just taking notes on cell membranes.

A comprehensive documentation will be added later this week. You can find help as well as contribute ideas in our discord at <a href=\"http://make.md/community\">http://make.md/community</a></p> <p>In addition to 1.0, one of the highly requested feedback was that the flow block and styler should be a standalone plug-in. Soon, these features will be available in a new plug-in called Basics. These will no longer depend on <a href=\"http://make.md\">make.md</a> so you can use those without having to install the organization and personalization features. Look forward to Basics in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Wishing everyone an amazing holiday season!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jpcen\"> /u/jpcen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hmdsf6/makemd_10_is_now_available_organization_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hmdsf6/makemd_10_is_now_available_organization_and/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Academics: tracking potential sources","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hmda8m/academics_tracking_potential_sources/","date":1735174820,"author":"/u/itsonlyliz","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m an academic. I use use Paperpile to collect my sources and the Citations plugin in Obsidian to add book/ article notes.

At the moment, I add the sources to Paperpile in a &quot;potential sources&quot; folder, then create the note in Obsidian using the Citation plugin with the tag &quot;Potential.&quot; I also add a callout at the top with a link to the original source where I found the potential one. </p> <p>&gt; For example, if I read <em>Breaking the Social Media Prism</em> by Chris Bail and he references Eli Pariser&#39;s <em>Filter Bubble</em> I create an empty note for Pariser&#39;s book with a callout that is \\@bail2020-SocialPrism and the reason why I might want to read it.</p> <p>The goal isn&#39;t to get a never-ending to read list, though. I would like to be able to look at the graph view, see which articles are being referenced a lot across the readings I&#39;ve already done and then choose those to read. Using the above example, if another book <em>Meme Wars</em> by Joan Donovan et al. also references Pariser&#39;s <em>Filter Bubble</em> I can see that I should probably look into it. </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s an easier way of keeping track of these potential sources rather than cluttering up both Paperpile and Obsidian with sources I may never read.
