Like today, I spent 3 hours building a workflow using QuickAdd, Templater, and Python Scripter that:</p> <ol> <li>Prompts me for an ElevenLabs conversation ID.</li> <li>Adds that ID to the note‚Äôs title and at the bottom of the note.</li> <li>Reads the note to grab the ID and runs a Python script I wrote to: <ul> <li>Connect to ElevenLabs‚Äô API to download the transcript.</li> <li>Use OpenAI to create a summary.</li> <li>Format everything into a neat, organized layout in the note.</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>Will I use this feature a lot? No. But honestly, building it was so much fun. It felt like solving a really satisfying puzzle.</p> <p>This isn‚Äôt even the first time I‚Äôve done something like this. The other day, I built a system to add comments to my notes or track daily updates. Before that, I spent a whole day creating a smart, dynamic index for my study notes using DataviewJS.</p> <p>I even started learning JavaScript just because of Obsidian.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the funny part: I don‚Äôt have that many notes! 90% of the time I‚Äôm in Obsidian, I‚Äôm adding new features or tweaking old ones. But I have <em>zero</em> regrets.</p> <p>Every project teaches me something new, whether it‚Äôs coding, problem-solving, or just finding creative ways to make things work. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve leveled up my skills a ton since I started using Obsidian.</p> <p>Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one who spends more time working on their setup than actually using it üò≠</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/esteban0009\"> /u/esteban0009 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hn4elw/man_i_love_working_on_obsidian/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hn4elw/man_i_love_working_on_obsidian/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Besides Obsidian native and Minimal, is there another theme created by someone from the obsidian team?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hmwzo3/besides_obsidian_native_and_minimal_is_there/","date":1735244330,"author":"/u/BunchAffectionate358","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for a stable theme but I&#39;m complicated by the fact that Minimal is horrible in its bar, I find it strange.
