Here's the pitch:<p><i>Anki AI Utils</i> is a suite of AI-powered tools designed to automatically improve cards you find challenging. Whether you're studying medicine, languages, or any complex subject, these tools can:<p>- <i>Explain</i> difficult concepts with clear, ChatGPT-generated explanations.<p>- <i>Illustrate</i> key ideas using Dall-E or Stable Diffusion-generated images.<p>- <i>Create mnemonics</i> tailored to your memory style, including support for the Major System.<p>- <i>Reformulate</i> poorly worded cards for clarity and better retention.<p><i>Key Features:</i><p>- <i>Adaptive Learning:</i> Uses semantic similarity to match cards with relevant examples.<p>- <i>Personalized Memory Hooks:</i> Builds on your existing mnemonics for stronger recall.<p>- <i>Automation Ready:</i> Run scripts daily to enhance cards you struggled with.<p>- <i>Universal Compatibility:</i> Works across all Anki clients (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS).<p><i>Example:</i><p>For a flashcard about febrile seizures, Anki AI Utils can:<p>- Generate a <i>Dall-E illustration</i> of a toddler holding a teacup next to a fireplace.<p>- Create <i>mnemonics</i> like \"A child stumbles near the fire, dances symmetrically, has one strike, and fewer than three fires.\"<p>- Provide an <i>explanation</i> of why febrile seizures occur and their diagnostic criteria.<p><i>Call for Contributors:</i><p>This project is battle-tested but needs help to become a polished Anki addon. If you’re a developer or enthusiast, join us to make these tools more accessible!<p><i>Check out my other projects on GitHub:</i> [Anki AI Utils](<a href=\"https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub\">https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub</a>)<p>Transform your Anki experience with AI—because learning should be smarter, not harder.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534931\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534931</a></p>\n<p>Points: 147</p>\n<p># Comments: 20</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"I automated my job application process","url":"https://blog.daviddodda.com/how-i-automated-my-job-application-process-part-1","date":1735399591,"author":"paul-tharun","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.daviddodda.com/how-i-automated-my-job-application-process-part-1\">https://blog.daviddodda.com/how-i-automated-my-job-application-process-part-1</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531695\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531695</a></p>\n<p>Points: 454</p>\n<p># Comments: 642</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"EmacsConf 2024 Notes","url":"https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/12/emacsconf-2024-notes/","date":1735395750,"author":"JNRowe","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/12/emacsconf-2024-notes/\">https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/12/emacsconf-2024-notes/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42531217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 291</p>\n<p># Comments: 101</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Where can you go in Europe by train in 8h?","url":"https://www.chronotrains.com/en","date":1735386195,"author":"vortex_ape","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.chronotrains.com/en\">https://www.chronotrains.com/en</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530332\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530332</a></p>\n<p>Points: 518</p>\n<p># Comments: 342</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Carlsen disqualified from World Rapid and Blitz championship for wearing jeans","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/magnus-carlsen-disqualified-from-world-rapid-and-blitz-championship-for-wearing-jeans-article-116727852","date":1735347246,"author":"throwup238","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/magnus-carlsen-disqualified-from-world-rapid-and-blitz-championship-for-wearing-jeans-article-116727852\">https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/magnus-carlsen-disqualified-from-world-rapid-and-blitz-championship-for-wearing-jeans-article-116727852</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42527572\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42527572</a></p>\n<p>Points: 298</p>\n<p># Comments: 370</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Gambler Who Cracked the Horse-Racing Code (2018)","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-03/the-gambler-who-cracked-the-horse-racing-code","date":1735241979,"author":"sebg","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-03/the-gambler-who-cracked-the-horse-racing-code\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-03/the-gambler-who-cracked-the-horse-racing-code</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517234\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517234</a></p>\n<p>Points: 126</p>\n<p># Comments: 52</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"NASA, Axiom Space Change Assembly Order of Commercial Space Station","url":"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasa-axiom-space-change-assembly-order-of-commercial-space-station/","date":1735238001,"author":"mzs","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasa-axiom-space-change-assembly-order-of-commercial-space-station/\">https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasa-axiom-space-change-assembly-order-of-commercial-space-station/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42516836\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42516836</a></p>\n<p>Points: 77</p>\n<p># Comments: 28</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Joco almost died at launch.
