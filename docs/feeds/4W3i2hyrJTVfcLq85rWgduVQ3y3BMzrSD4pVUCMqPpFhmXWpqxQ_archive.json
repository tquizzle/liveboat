But a new clinical trial has repaired this damage in patients thanks to a transplant of stem cells from their healthy eyes.</p><p>The cornea is the outer layer of the eye, which focuses light towards the retina. Since it’s on the frontline of potential hazards from the outside world, the cornea features a population of limbal epithelial stem cells, which repair minor damage to keep the surface smooth and functional.</p><p>Unfortunately, injuries like thermal or chemical burns can damage the cornea beyond the capability of these resident stem cells. There’s not much else that can be done – even a <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/human-corneas-3d-printed/54837/\" data-cms-ai=\"0\">cornea transplant</a> won’t take hold if the damage is too severe.</p><p>The new study, conducted by scientists at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, investigated a new treatment called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells (CALEC). This involves removing stem cells from a patient’s uninjured eye, growing their population in the lab for a few weeks, then surgically transplanting them into the injured eye.</p><p>The phase 1/2 trial recruited 14 patients to undergo the procedure, and followed them for 18 months afterwards. Success was primarily judged by how effectively the treatment repaired the cornea’s surface, while a secondary test analyzed improvements to visual acuity.</p><p>By the first checkup at three months, the corneas of seven (50%) of the participants had been completely restored. By the 12-month mark, that number had increased to 11 (79%) patients. Two other participants met the definition for partial success, so the team claims an overall success rate of 92% for CALEC.</p><p>It’s worth noting that three participants did require a second transplant of stem cells, with one of them going on to reach the mark of complete success by the end of the study. In tests of visual acuity in the damaged eye, the majority of patients regained some sight, with some advancing from legally blind to low vision.</p><p>No serious adverse effects that were attributed to the procedure were seen in the patients, in either the donor or recipient eyes.

This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.</p><p>Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)\">glutamate</a> (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine#In_vitro\">complicated</a> effects on glutamate receptors.</p><p>Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier\">thin layer of cells</a> that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.615\"></a> get through these cells and into the brain.</p><p>So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/aspartame/#the-european-food-safety-authority-efsa\">these kinds of issues</a>, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2238\">assessment</a> in 2011 and found:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Improvement of cognitive function</td><td>cause and effect relationship has not been established</td></tr><tr><td>Alleviation of psychological stress</td><td>cause and effect relationship has not been established</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance of normal sleep</td><td>cause and effect relationship has not been established</td></tr><tr><td>Reduction of menstrual discomfort</td><td>cause and effect relationship has not been established</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=\"https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/\">Examine</a> is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .</p><p>A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00771-5\">2020 review</a> of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam\">alprazolam</a> (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.</p><p>After 2020, the only major trial I could find was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2020.4803\">this 2021 study</a> that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.</p><p>I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)</p><p>Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?</p><p>Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.</p><p>Everyone agrees theanine is <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/182086/download\">safe</a>. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.</p><p>First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?</p><p>So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:</p><ol><li>Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.</li><li>Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.</li><li>Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.</li><li>Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.</li><li>Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.</li><li>Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.</li></ol><p>After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules:</p><p> 200 mg L-Theanine</p><p> 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin D</p><p>These are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.</p><p>For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.</p><p>Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.</p><p>Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.</p><p>Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.</p><p>This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.</p><p>For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.112.166371\">enough</a> to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.</p><p>After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.</p><p>Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:</p><p>Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.</p><p>Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:</p><p>Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.</p><p>My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.</p><p>Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.</p><p>So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:</p><ol><li>Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.</li><li>Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.</li><li>Theanine works, but I was unlucky.</li><li>Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.</li><li>Theanine works on some people, but not me.</li></ol><p>It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.</p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by <a href=\"https://niplav.site/nootropics#LTheanine\">Niplav</a>, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.</p><p>What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:</p><p>Stimulants work! But for everything else…</p><p>I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.</p><p>I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I liked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.</p><p>So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.</p><p>I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.</p><h2>Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statistics</h2><p>Do you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?</p><p>I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.</p><p>If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.</p><p>While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.</p><p>But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Stress went down, p &lt; .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.</p><p>Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.</p><p>Speaking of raw data, you can download mine <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/data.csv\">here</a>.</p>","contentLength":12342,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43305803"},{"title":"Building an open-source Wi-Fi Mac layer for the ESP32","url":"https://esp32-open-mac.be/","date":1741480376,"author":"pabs3","guid":139,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The ESP32 is a low-cost microcontroller with Wi-Fi connectivity.\nCurrently, the Wi-Fi MAC layer of the ESP32 is closed-source.\nThis project aims to change that: by reverse engineering the hardware registers and software, we can build a networking stack that is open-source up to the hardware, instead of having to use the proprietary MAC layer.</p><p>This will improve security auditability, open up the possibility for features not supported in the proprietary implementation (for example, standards-compliant mesh networking), improve interoperability and make research into Wi-Fi networks with lots of nodes more affordable.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/esp32-open-mac\">esp32-open-mac</a> (we know it's confusing that one reference implementation has the same name as the overarching project, but bear with us)\nThis is a reference implementation that demonstrates how the hardware works, written in C and Rust: the hardware abstraction and initialization is written in C; the MAC stack (parsing packets and deciding which packets to send when) is written in Rust.\nThis relies on two FreeRTOS tasks; one to handle the hardware, one to handle the MAC stack.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/FoA\">Ferris-on-Air (FoA)</a>: this is a reference implementation in pure async Rust.

Some of them are only vaguely humanoid.</p></blockquote><p>At one point, the elves migrate to Roundworld and cause havoc there, by killing the narrative vigor of history with their empty and superficial illusions, until Discworlders save the day. I like to pretend this actually happened.</p><p>Everything satirized and parodied in Discworld, all the ironically deployed tropes of fantasy, are accounted for as the workings of narrativium. That means in-world, all the effects of narrativium are made fun of, but not treated as existential threats. Within the meta-story of Discworld, narrativium adds some of the coherence and discipline that the Auditors of Reality yearn for, but not in a deadening, joyless way. Narrativium is life-affirming narrative irony embodied and embraced.</p><p>The essential property of Narrativium is that it ensures that the history of Discworld will unfold in satisfying ways that make it a good story. This property is most on display in the fifth major sequence of novels in the map: the Industrial Revolution sequence, which feature one of the most interesting characters, Moist Von Lipwig, who is Vetinari’s fixer, nudging technological progress along.</p><p>The details of these developments usually feature absurd (and absurdly entertaining) twists on the corresponding Roundworld historical events, while largely staying true to the logic of Roundworld history. For example, film technology on Discworld relies on some faux-science built around small goblins who sit in the cameras painting really fast (magical, but in an inconsequential way).</p><p>And it’s all very satisfying, in ways the corresponding histories on Roundworld are not. The story also feels a lot more forcefully inevitable and necessary, but not in a restrictive or totalizing way. It is intensified rather than revisionist Roundworld history. </p><p>That’s what makes narrativium good to have around.</p><p>This process is one of generative discovery and continuously improvised contingency. The rule that governs this evolutionary process on Discworld, in Pratchett’s own words, is “Our minds make stories, and stories make our minds.”</p><p>This is the Pratchett version of “hyperstitional theory fiction” which applies with much greater force in Discworld, such that far more consequential things can be memed into existence. </p><p>In the most extreme case, as we’ve seen, the gods of Discworld themselves are memed into existence by belief, like over-powered versions of the subjects of Roundworld cults of personality. Roundworld religions, thankfully, don’t have this kind of power to create Roundworld gods of equal substance, since unlike the retiring and lazy Discworld gods, we tend to imagine very interventionist and opinionated gods for ourselves.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/25/worlding-raga-5-world-how/\" rel=\"\">as part of an extended series</a></p><blockquote><p><em>narratives tell archetypes how to evolve, archetypes tell narratives how to curve.</em><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/25/worlding-raga-5-world-how/#1\" rel=\"\"></a></p></blockquote><p>Roundworld, sadly, does not have more than trace quantities of narrativium, which is why Roundworld histories are often so unsatisfying and so easily fall prey to Discworld elves, or humans possessed by them.</p><p><em>what does Discworld want?</em></p><p>The sentiment behind the aspiration is perhaps a mark of British culture at its best. The high conceit of Discworld is that the infinite game always prevails and cannot truly be derailed by even by the most powerful forces. The mediocre efforts of ordinary characters powered by narrativium is enough to keep the infinite game going.</p><p><em>always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. </em></p><p>The history of Roundworld in recent centuries has, at least empirically, exhibited such tendencies, but unlike the denizens of Discworld, we cannot trust in that being the intrinsic nature of our world. Certainly those currently in power are trying to prove it isn’t.</p><p><em>greater generativity and complexity and more alternatives.</em></p><p>Or to put it another way, Discworld has an astounding, unbreakable resistance to Chosen Ones at any scale except the scale of the world itself. Discworld is powered by the anthropic principle on steroids. It keeps discovering new ways in which its entire reality is special.</p><p>This is one reason Discworld can afford to be such a kind world. As a world that is intrinsically pre-disposed to reject totalizing narratives and protect multiple possibilities in an ever-expanding garden of forking paths, reality is on the side of pluralism and against totalizing conceits.</p><p>This is why, on Discworld, even the weakest, most mediocre protagonists, when going up against a powerful Chosen One who wants to capture and enslave reality, can afford to be gracious. Even when they are at the lowest, and cowering before a Chosen One who thinks he has won. Because thanks to the narrativium levels in the environment, the protagonists know they will win, and need never despair. </p><p>The Discworld protagonist seems to know that though they must always scramble comically and improvise energetically to save it from the monstrous Chosen One of the Week, the arc of their moral universe bends in their favor. </p><p>Discworld is a world that knows what it wants, and how to get it. With some nudging along by Vetinari, Death, and Time Monks, and a lot of reluctant anti-heroic adventuring by the likes of Rincewind, Vimes, Granny Weatherwax, and Moist von Lipwig. Narrativium helps those who help themselves. </p><p>Unlike Discworld, our own Roundworld has no such specific disposition. The ideas that the arc of moral history on Roundworld bends towards justice, or that “reality” has a well-known liberal bias (a comforting premise of the late-lamented hyperstitional theory fiction of traditional American politics known as “normalcy”) that are popular with us are no more than thin, wishful fictions. Probably planted in our heads by the Discworld elves.</p><p>Roundworld does not want anything in particular, and no future is necessary. As Discworld scientists have discovered on their trips here, life and civilization have evolved and been destroyed multiple times on Roundworld, in a meaningless process of fragile evolution.</p><p>Because kindness is worth it for its own sake, even if Roundworld lacks the narrativium leverage to turn it into a world-protecting force.</p><p>The idea that there are many alternatives is the second most politically loaded one I’ve ever put out, after the idea that with the right technological scaffolding, a proper reckoning with history is in fact possible and desirable, and not necessarily an exercise in bad-faith book-keeping of resentments and grievances. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow43pFm9GLQ\" rel=\"\">Bloodcoin</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxBA_9dm6xk\" rel=\"\">Civilizational Hypercomplexity</a></p><p>But at least we’re exploring many alternatives for the moment and not locking into one. And at least the value of real attempts to reckon with history, of the sort I gesture at in the Bloodcoin talk, is becoming crystal clear, given the barrage of wild and transparently motivated confabulations we are now enduring. </p><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/@contraptions/note/c-98520101\" rel=\"\">a note</a></p><blockquote><p>If you want peace, prepare for war. If you want war, prepare for peace.</p><p>If you want the benefits of war without the costs of peace, lie through your teeth about everything</p></blockquote><p>Vetinari, incidentally, did not believe the popular first epigram; he thought the truth was more banal — If you want peace, prepare for peace, if you want war, prepare for war. But I think he would agree with my second thought. Whatever the causal pattern linking war and peace, it is clear that those possessed by elves (or Auditors of Reality) lie through their teeth about everything to justify doing whatever they please, as Chosen Ones.</p><p>Should you live by Discworld rules of kindness and grace, when all that might get you is contempt and destruction? </p><p>Or should you tell yourself stories that make your mind of sterner stuff? </p><p>The Culture is a galactic-scale post-scarcity anarcho-capitalist mongrel utopia under the benevolent protection of superintelligent spaceships. The closest fully realized fictional universe to that meme about fully automated luxury gay space communism.</p><p>The Culture’s AIs and drones have no compunctions about killing and destruction — this is no gentle Three Laws of Robotics Asimovian universe. In fact, the series opens in the aftermath of a bloody war between the Culture and a peer civilization.</p><p>In the Culture, what is a natural property of reality in Discworld is enforced with extreme prejudice and violence. The entirety of the Culture is like an Assassin’s Guild, with the agents and minds of Special Circumstances acting collectively like a much more forceful Vetinari. </p><p>While life inside the Culture is something like a high-abundance version of an Ursula Le Guin style peaceful anarchy, its actions in foreign space resemble those of the CIA and KGB at the height of the Cold War, rolled into one. Fomenting revolutions, deposing leaders, assassinations — the whole shebang.</p><p>Should we play by Discworld Rules or Culture Rules in the coming years? Should we try to become strong before choosing to be kind, or should we choose kindness whether or not we happen to be strong or weak at any given time?</p><p>I don’t know, but I like that I have at least two good alternatives to ponder. That is the power of not being tied to one narrative with no alternatives being admissible. </p><p>I may never end up choosing, but I think either set of rules would be better than LOTR rules.</p>","contentLength":15167,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43299815"},{"title":"Volkswagen reintroducing physical controls for vital functions","url":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-reintroducing-physical-controls-vital-functions","date":1741418749,"author":"zfg","guid":133,"unread":true,"content":"<p>All future <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen\">Volkswagen</a> models will feature physical controls for the most important functions, design chief Andreas Mindt has said.</p><p>The German firm has been criticised over the past few&nbsp;years for moving many of the vital controls in its cars from physical buttons and dials to the infotainment touchscreen.

The risk was found to be overhyped – a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.</p><p>The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”</p><p>The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale.</p><p>Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00026-1\" data-track=\"click\" data-label=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00026-1\" data-track-category=\"body text link\">scientific literature</a>.</p><p>The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.</p><p>Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.</p><p>Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.</p><p>The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.</p><p>The rate of false positives, instances when the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.</p><p>So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.</p>","contentLength":4583,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43295692"},{"title":"\"Big 3\" science fiction magazines including Asimov's and Analog acquired","url":"https://jasonsanford.substack.com/p/genre-grapevine-for-last-half-of","date":1741214872,"author":"ilamont","guid":131,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43273828"},{"title":"SMBC Parts Ways with Hiveworks","url":"https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/announcement-2","date":1741195844,"author":"momeara","guid":130,"unread":true,"content":"<div><div>Posted March 5, 2025 at 11:35 am</div></div>","contentLength":32,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43269614"},{"title":"Roald Dahl on the death of his daughter (2015)","url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/roald-dahls-darkest-hour/","date":1741181385,"author":"areoform","guid":129,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43266129"}],"tags":["dev"]}
