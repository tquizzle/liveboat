So her parents met with a consultant from Open Bionics, which fits people with lightweight, 3D-printed prostheses that function more like a natural arm and hand &mdash; known as Hero Arms.\n\n\nThe bionic arms are manufactured in Britain and cost about $24,000, but the Batemans were hopeful that their health insurance company, Select Health, would pay for one for [their 9-year-old daughter] Remi. Remi said she tried using one of the robotic arms for a few days in Colorado and was thrilled to cut her food with a knife and fork for the first time and carry plates with two hands. \"I loved it so much &mdash; I could function like a full human,\" she said. \"I was able to steal my dad's hat. When they fit me for my arm, I told them I wanted it to be pink.\" \n\nOn Oct. 1, the Batemans sent a prescription for the robotic arm and office notes from Remi's pediatrician to Select Health for approval. One week later, their request was denied, Jami Bateman said. \"They sent us a letter saying it was not medically necessary for Remi to have a Hero Arm and that it was for cosmetic use only,\" she said. \"We appealed twice and were again denied.\" \n\n\"It was very upsetting, and Remi cried when I told her, because we'd all been so hopeful,\" Bateman added. \"It broke our hearts.\" In mid-December, a frustrated Jami Bateman tried an approach she'd seen other people use when their health insurance failed them: She started a GoFundMe for her daughter, hoping to purchase a robotic arm through the kindness of strangers.... Bateman was stunned when friends and strangers chipped in more than $30,000 in just a few days, surpassing the family's $24,000 goal. People who donated understood the Batemans' predicament, and many were furious on their behalf. \n\nAs donations poured in, the Batemans received a call from somebody else who wanted to help. Andy Schoonover is the CEO of CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based resource that helps people negotiate lower costs for medical bills. He told the family on Dec. 16 that his company wanted to pay the entire cost of Remi's bionic arm. \"We were looking for some ways to help people during the holiday season, and I stumbled upon Remi's story on social media,\" Schoonover said. \"We were honored to help her out....\" \n\nRemi quickly came up with an idea. \"She came to me and said, 'Mom, I know how it feels to have one hand. Is there someone else we can help?\" Bateman recalled. She said she contacted Open Bionics and learned there was a long list of children who had been turned down for Hero Arms by their health insurance companies for the same reason Remi was denied... \n\nSomewhere in Maryland, the mother of a 9-year-old boy born without a left hand suddenly got a surprise phone call explaining Remi's decision. \"I was so proud of Remi that I immediately started crying,\" she said. \"She wanted to give my son an opportunity that I was unable to give him. It just touched my heart.\" \n\nThey had been trying to raise money by running a lemonade stand. But yesterday Remi's GoFundMe page posted an update. The 9-year-old boy's arm had now been paid for. \n\n\"And maybe, if more donations roll in we can help a third child!\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Anger+at+Health+Insurance+Prompts+the+Public+to+Fund+a+9-Year-Old's+Bionic+Arm%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0213248%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0213248%2Fanger-at-health-insurance-prompts-the-public-to-fund-a-9-year-olds-bionic-arm%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/0213248/anger-at-health-insurance-prompts-the-public-to-fund-a-9-year-olds-bionic-arm?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563755&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Ubuntu's Great Year From 24.04 LTS To Focusing More On Performance Optimizations","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-2024-Great-Year","date":1735473669,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"From my independent monitoring, Ubuntu Linux had a pretty great year.

Here's a look back at the year in Python. \n\nIn the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or \"GIL,\" a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue &mdash; enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. \n\nThe no-GIL or \"free-threaded\" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. \nAnother forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.\n \nPython is now more widely used than JavaScript on GitHub (thanks partly to its role in AI and data science code).<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Python+in+2024%3A+Faster%2C+More+Powerful%2C+and+More+Popular+Than+Ever%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0534253%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0534253%2Fpython-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/0534253/python-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563841&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The TechBeat: RootstockCollective In-Depth: Empowering Bitcoin Builders (12/29/2024)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/12-29-2024-techbeat?source=rss","date":1735456253,"author":"Techbeat","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>How are you, hacker? \n 🪐<strong>Want to know what's trending right now?:</strong>\n <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/homepage-has-a-new-baby\">The Techbeat by HackerNoon </a> has got you covered with fresh content from our trending stories of the day!

Justin McLeod, CEO of Hinge, outlined how the company intends to fully embrace AI next year: more personalized matching, smarter algorithms that adapt to users and better understand them over time and AI coaching for struggling daters. \"While AI is not going to be a panacea when it comes to the very deeply and personal problem of love, I can tell you that it is going to transform the dating app experience, taking it from a do-it-yourself platform to an expertly guided journey that leads to far better outcomes and much better value to our daters,\" he told investors.... \n\nIt's already starting to play a bigger role. Tinder, for example, uses AI to help users select their best profile photos. Meanwhile, Bumble's recently enhanced \"For You\" roundup uses advanced AI when delivering its daily set of four curated profiles based on a user's preferences and past matches. Bumble also uses AI in safety features like its Private Detector &mdash; an AI-powered tool that blurs explicit images &mdash; and Deception Detector, which identifies spam, scams and fake profiles. Similarly, Match Group offers tools like buttons that say \"Are You Sure?\" to detect harmful language and \"Does This Bother You?\" to prompt users to report inappropriate behavior.... \n\n According to Liesel Sharabi, an associate professor at Arizona State University's Hugh Downs School of Human Communication, the dating industry is still \"very much in the early stages\" of embracing AI. \"The platforms are still figuring out its role in the online dating experience, but it really does have the potential to transform this space....\" Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd previously said she envisions AI functioning as a dating concierge, helping users navigate matches, set up dates and respond to messages. Startups such as Volar and Rizz have already experimented with chatbots that help respond to messages. On Rizz, users upload screenshots of conversations they're having on other dating apps, and the platform helps create flirty replies. (Volar, a standalone dating app that trains on users' preferences and automatically responds to other chatbots, shut down in September due to lack of funding.) While the concept of chatbots dating on your behalf may seem strange, it could reduce the tedious early-stage communication by focusing more on highly compatible matches, Sharabi said... \n\nDuring Match Group's investor day, Hinge's McLeod announced plans to build the \"world's most knowledgeable dating coach\" using years of insights from the dating process... McLeod said Hinge has already seen a higher number of matches and subscription renewals with its improved AI algorithm among early test groups. It plans to roll this out globally in March. \nAnd of course, some users are already using ChatGPT to write online dating profiles or respond to messages, the article points out...<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Will+AI+Transform+Online+Dating%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0652238%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0652238%2Fwill-ai-transform-online-dating%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/0652238/will-ai-transform-online-dating?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563209&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"LEAP 71 Hot-Fires Advanced Aerospike Rocket Engine Designed by AI","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/2312227/leap-71-hot-fires-advanced-aerospike-rocket-engine-designed-by-ai?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735428840,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 writes: The Dubai-based startup LEAP71, focused on using AI software to quickly develop rocket engine designs it can then 3D print, has successfully test fired a prototype aerospike engine on December 18, 2024 during a static fire test campaign conducted in the United Kingdom. \n\nAlong the way they tackled a problem with bell-shaped rocket nozzles, writes New Atlas. \"A rocket that works very well on liftoff will work less well as it rises in the atmosphere and the air pressure decreases. This is why second- and third-stage rocket engines are different from those of the first stage.\"\n\nIdeally, engineers want an engine that can adjust itself automatically to changes in air pressure. An aerospike does this by shaping the engine into a spike or plug with a curve like that of the inside of a rocket bell. As the combustion gases flow from the engine over the spike, the curve acts as one side of the bell and the surrounding air as the outside curve. As the air pressure changes, so does the shape of the virtual bell. There have been a number of aerospike engines developed since the 1950s and one has actually gone airborne, but there's still a long way to go when it comes to turning a promising idea into a practical space engine. \n\nLEAP 71's contribution to the effort is to apply its Noyron Large Computational Engineering Model to the problem. It's an AI programmed and trained by aerospace experts to take a given set of input parameters and use them to create a design that meets those parameters by inferring physical interactions of various factors, including thermal behaviors and projected performance. The results of this are then fed back into the AI model to fine tune it as it presents computed performance parameters, the geometry of the engine, the parameters of the manufacturing process, and other details. \n\n\"Despite their clear advantages, Aerospikes are not used in space access today,\" LEAP 71's co-founder said in a statement. \"We want to change that. Noyron allows us to radically cut the time we need to re-engineer and iterate after a test and enables us to converge rapidly on an optimal design.\" \n\nAerospikes \"are more compact and significantly more efficient across various atmospheric pressures, including the vacuum of space,\" the company said this week &mdash; announcing the successful hot-firing of their Aerospike engine, and calling it \"one of the most advanced and elusive rocket engines ever created...\"\n\n By leveraging the power of Noyron's computational AI, the thruster was developed in a matter of weeks, manufactured as a monolithic piece of copper through industrial 3D printing, and put on the test stand, where it worked successfully on the first attempt... \n\nThe Aerospike was fired on December 18th, 2024, as part of a four-engines-in-four-days campaign conducted by LEAP&#226;71 at Airborne Engineering in Westcott, UK. The company will process the collected data to fine-tune Noyron for the next iteration of engines and continue testing in 2025, with the goal of making Aerospikes a viable option for modern spacecraft.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=LEAP+71+Hot-Fires+Advanced+Aerospike+Rocket+Engine+Designed+by+AI%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F2312227%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F2312227%2Fleap-71-hot-fires-advanced-aerospike-rocket-engine-designed-by-ai%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/2312227/leap-71-hot-fires-advanced-aerospike-rocket-engine-designed-by-ai?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563667&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Communications of the ACM Asks: Is It Ethical To Work For Big Tech?","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/2030223/communications-of-the-acm-asks-is-it-ethical-to-work-for-big-tech?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735425240,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes:\n\n\n\nBack in January, Rice University professor and former CACM Editor-in-Chief Moshe Y.

In fact, our current climate crisis is a demonstrated market failure. To take an extreme example, Big Tobacco surely does not support the public good, and most of us would agree that it is unethical to work for Big Tobacco. The question, thus, is whether Big Tech is supporting the public good, and if not, what should Big Tech workers do about it. Of course, there is no simple answer to such a question, and the only reasonable answer to the question of whether it is ethical to work for Big Tech is, 'It depends.' [...] It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it, said the writer and political activist Upton Sinclair. By and large, Big Tech workers do not seem to be asking themselves hard questions, I believe, hence my conclusion that we do indeed suffer from an ethics crisis.\"\n\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Communications+of+the+ACM+Asks%3A+Is+It+Ethical+To+Work+For+Big+Tech%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F2030223%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F2030223%2Fcommunications-of-the-acm-asks-is-it-ethical-to-work-for-big-tech%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/2030223/communications-of-the-acm-asks-is-it-ethical-to-work-for-big-tech?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563567&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Google CEO says AI model Gemini will the company’s ‘biggest focus’ in 2025","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/28/google-ceo-says-ai-model-gemini-will-the-companys-biggest-focus-in-2025/","date":1735423241,"author":"Anthony Ha","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly told Google employees that 2025 will be a “critical” year for the company.

Protocol 4.2 satisfies option correctness: If both the Alice and Bob are conforming, then if Alice does not exercise the right, Alice doesn’t lose the 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and Bob doesn’t lose the 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵; or if Alice exercise the right, then Alice will receive 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 and Bob will receive 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 .</p>\n<p>\\\nProof. According to Protocol 4.2, it is evident that if Alice escrows her collateral in the 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 contract and calls 𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑒 (), then a conforming Bob will reveal the pre-image 𝐵 in 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 to reclaim the guarantee 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and Alice’s collateral 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴. Subsequently, Alice can use 𝐵 to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵. If Alice does not escrow the collateral, Bob will not reveal 𝐵. After the option expires at 𝑇𝐸 +2Δ, Bob can call𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑖𝑚() and 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑢𝑛𝑑 () on the respective chains to reclaim 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 7. <em>Protocol 4.2 satisfies exercisablity: During the transfer from Bob to Dave, the option remains active, allowing Alice to exercise the option without any delays.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. According to Protocol 4.2.1, during the transfer from Bob to Dave, Alice can make a deposit and exercise her option at any time. If the transfer is in the Setup Phase, Bob will need to reveal 𝐵 to fulfill his obligation and revoke the transfer. It is important to note that Dave can use 𝐵 to reclaim 𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑊 . If the transfer is in the Attempt Phase and Bob acts maliciously by using 𝐵 to take 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 , Alice can use 𝐵 to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵. Dave will need to use 𝐵 on 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 to withdraw the transfer. Otherwise, when Dave uses 𝜎𝑚 to change the writer and the hash lock, he will reveal a new preimage secret 𝐷, which Alice can then use to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 8. <em>Protocol 4.2 satisfies failure compensation: Before expiration, Alice can exercise the option successfully, or if the exercise fails, she is compensated with the guarantee deposited by Bob.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. By Theorem 6, if Alice successfully exercises her option, she will receive Bob’s collateral. Otherwise, after Alice makes a deposit and calls 𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑒 (), 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 can invoke 𝑖𝑠𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑑 () to determine if the exercise has occurred. If Bob does not fulfill his obligation within a period of Δ, Alice can call 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑖𝑚() to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 as compensation, and Bob will lose his guarantee.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zifan Peng, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (zpengao@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(2) Yingjie Xue, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (yingjiexue@hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(3) Jingyu Liu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (jliu514@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"'Universal Basic Income' Isn't a Silver Bullet, Says Lead Researcher on Sam Altman's Study","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/0535244/universal-basic-income-isnt-a-silver-bullet-says-lead-researcher-on-sam-altmans-study?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735421640,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":" Business Insider reports:\n\nThe lead researcher for Sam Altman's basic-income study says guaranteed no-strings payments are not a silver bullet for issues facing lower-income Americans. Elizabeth Rhodes, the research director for the Basic Income Project at Open Research, told Business Insider that while basic-income payments are \"beneficial in many ways,\" the programs also have \"clear limitations....\" \n\nRhodes headed up one of the largest studies in the space, which focused specifically on those on low incomes rather than making universal payments to adults across all economic demographics. The three-year experiment, backed by OpenAI boss Altman, provided 1,000 low-income participants with $1,000 a month without any stipulations for how they could spend it.... The initial findings, released in July, found that recipients put the bulk of their extra spending toward basic needs such as rent, transportation, and food. They also worked less on average but remained engaged in the workforce and were more deliberate in their job searches compared with a control group. But Rhodes says the research reinforced how difficult it is to solve complex issues such as poverty or economic insecurity, and that there is \"a lot more work to do.\" \n\nThe Altman-backed study is still reporting results. New findings released in December showed recipients valued work more after receiving the recurring monthly payments &mdash; a result that may challenge one of the main arguments against basic income payments. Participants also reported significant reductions in stress, mental distress, and food insecurity during the first year, though those effects faded by the second and third years of the program. \"Poverty and economic insecurity are incredibly difficult problems to solve,\" Rhodes said. \"The findings that we've had thus far are quite nuanced.\" \n\nShe added: \"There's not a clear through line in terms of, this helps everyone, or this does that. It reinforced to me the idea that these are really difficult problems that, maybe, there isn't a singular solution.\" \n\nIn an earlier article coauthor David Broockman told Business Insider that the study's results might offer insights into how future programs could be successful &mdash; but said that the study's results didn't necessarily confirm the fears or hopes expressed by skeptics or supporters of a basic income. \n\n\nThanks to Slashdot reader jjslash for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status='Universal+Basic+Income'+Isn't+a+Silver+Bullet%2C+Says+Lead+Researcher+on+Sam+Altman's+Study%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0535244%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0535244%2Funiversal-basic-income-isnt-a-silver-bullet-says-lead-researcher-on-sam-altmans-study%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/0535244/universal-basic-income-isnt-a-silver-bullet-says-lead-researcher-on-sam-altmans-study?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563177&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How Cross-Chain Transfer Protocols Ensure Safe and Smooth Transactions","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-cross-chain-transfer-protocols-ensure-safe-and-smooth-transactions?source=rss","date":1735421412,"author":"EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Um9xbWbUFDMzkXakWgDh\">Abstract and Introduction</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/dKHrehhbzuaTHtgJFbvy\">Preliminaries</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/oyJxVXND1XBuIkqdQbUB\">Overview</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Protocol</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/zubShKzeJXXu82JolWP1\">4.1 Efficient Option Transfer Protocol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/DpuaIvNLjK32Qu0Ww6rb\">4.2 Holder Collateral-Free Cross-Chain Options</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Security Analysis</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/tvEU9LSYD1n72BFcPYRT\">5.1 Option Transfer Properties</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/VAh9cc7JIcgJxxRg7Fpi\">5.2 Option Properties</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/EFqsX8ZQC0xIihPVO1wn\">Implementation</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/QiR69gdekeOcmxVXfMmx\">Related Work</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/8Xg0iL7cvxWaswxK1nyU\">Conclusion and Discussion, and References</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n<strong>A.

It is evident that, Alice does not own the exercise secret, holder’s transfer is required to replace the holder address and transfer public key, and the inconsistency of two chains will not harm the interest of Bob. According to the Protocol 4.1, Bob cannot use the transfer private key of Alice, i.e. 𝑠𝑘𝐴 to claim assets. Therefore, during the reveal phase and consistency phase, Bob is not required to participate and not allowed to make any change on 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵.</p>\n<p>\\\nLemma 10. <em>If Bob and Dave are conforming, then the writer transfer procedure of Protocol 4.2.1 does not require Alice’s participation.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. Obviously, honest Bob will not leak two signatures or 𝑠𝑘𝐵 and honest Dave will submit signature 𝜎𝑚 on both 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵, Alice only needs to make operations when there is any dishonest party.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 2. <em>Protocol 4.2.1 satisfies liveness: If Alice, Bob, and Carol/Dave are conforming, then Alice/Bob will obtain Carol/Dave’s collateral, Carol/Dave will obtain Alice/Bob’s position, and Bob/Alice will retain their original position.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. By Lemma 9, Bob’s participation is not required during the holder transfer. If Alice and Carol are conforming, Carol will create 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 contract and lock her collateral using signature of Alice before 𝑇𝐻 − 3Δ. Alice will then reveal signature by 𝑠𝑘𝐴 and call𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑎𝑙() on𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 at𝑇𝐻 −2Δ. An honest Carol will forward the signature, setting the holder to Carol. Alice can then wait for 3Δ withdrawl delayed period to obtain the collateral, while the writers of𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 are still Bob, Bob maintains the writer’s position. During the process where Bob transfers his position to Dave, if both parties are conforming, Bob will not expose two different signatures. After 𝑇𝑊 + Δ, Bob will not be obstructed and will surely obtain Dave’s collateral. Meanwhile, Dave can submit 𝜎𝑚 between𝑇𝑊 −Δ and𝑇𝑊 to 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 to change the writer, Alice retaining the holder position.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 3. <em>Protocol 4.2.1 satisfies unobstructibility: Alice/Bob can transfer the position to another party even if Bob/Alice is adversarial.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. By Lemma 9, Bob’s participation is not required, it is evident that Bob cannot block the process of transferring a holder’s position. During Bob’s transfer to Dave, Alice can only obtain Bob’s collateral by two different messages signed with 𝑠𝑘𝐵 or the exercise secret. If Bob is honest, he will neither leak 𝑠𝐵, sign multiple messages nor leak exercise secret. Consequently, Alice cannot interrupt the transfer process.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-hi034rc.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. After 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 transfers to 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖+1, the holder in the current option’s 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 is updated to Alice𝑖+1, and the transfer key is known only to 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖+1. Therefore, after a holder transfer, 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖+1 can transfer the position to 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖+2 by re-performing Protocol 4.2.1 with the transfer key of 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖+2. Similarly, after 𝐵𝑜𝑏𝑗 transfers to 𝐵𝑜𝑏𝑗+1 (holder Alice does not contest within Δ), the writer in the current option’s 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 is updated to Bob𝑗+1. At this point, only 𝑠𝑘 𝑗+1 𝐵 or its signatures can be used for the next transfer. 𝐵𝑜𝑏𝑗+1 can also transfer the position by re-performing Protocol 4.2.1 with the new transfer key.</p>\n<p>\\\nLemma 11. Protocols 4.2.1 satisfy atomicity: If conforming Alice/Bob loses their position, she/he will be able to obtain Carol/Dave’s collateral.</p>\n<p>\\\nProof. Following Theorem 2, in transferring the holder position, after Carol correctly escrows the collateral, Alice temporarily locks the holder position in both contracts using 𝐻(𝐶). If Carol uses 𝐶 to obtain the position before 𝑇𝐻 , then Alice will obtain Carol’s collateral at 𝑇𝐻 + Δ. If Carol does not reveal 𝐶 before 𝑇𝐻 , Alice will not receive Carol’s collateral. Similarly, in transferring the writer position, if Bob does not reveal his signature honestly, then Bob will lose the position and Dave can retrieve and will not lose the collateral. If honest Bob signs for a buyer Dave, the honest Dave will use the signature to obtain Bob’s position at 𝑇𝑊 . Bob will then obtain Dave’s collateral at 𝑇𝑊 + Δ.</p>\n<p>\\\nB.1.1 <em>Safety</em>.</p>\n<p>\\\nProof. In the 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴, the following elements are defined:</p>\n<p>\\\n• 𝑇𝐸: The expiration time of this option. </p>\n<p>\\\n• exercise_hashlock: The hash lock of this option, which is the hash of a secret value known only to the writer. </p>\n<p>\\\n• old<em>exercise</em>hashlock: The hash lock of this option, which is the hash of a secret value known only to the writer. </p>\n<p>\\\n• holder: The holder can call 𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑒 () to exercise the option before 𝑇𝐸. </p>\n<p>\\\n• guarantee: The writer’s asset, i.e. 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 , which can be any asset mutually agreed upon by the holder and writer as guarantee. This can include tokens, NFTs, or any other type of asset. </p>\n<p>\\\n• writer: The writer can use the secret value to call 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑢𝑛𝑑 () to retrieve the guarantee or retrieve it directly after 𝑇𝐸 + 2Δ. </p>\n<p>\\\n• collateral: The collateral that Alice must deposit if she decides to exercise the option to purchase Bob’s asset. </p>\n<p>\\\n• holder<em>transfer</em>public_key: the transfer key of Alice, 𝑝𝑘𝐴, used for verify the transfer signature of Alice to Carol. </p>\n<p>\\\n• writer<em>transfer</em>public_key: New transfer key of Dave, 𝑝𝑘𝐷 , used for verify the transfer signature of Dave to others. </p>\n<p>\\\n• old<em>writer</em>transfer<em>public</em>key: Old transfer key of Bob, 𝑝𝑘𝐵, used for verify the transfer signature of Bob to Dave, Within the period of one Δ, during which the transfer signature must be submitted to this contract, we still need to record the old transfer public key in case of Bob’s misbehavior. </p>\n<p>\\\n• writer<em>transfer</em>time: The writer transfer time, used for Alice to claim assets if there exits misbehavior of Bob.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵, there are other additional items:</p>\n<p>\\\n• collateral: The writer’s collateral, i.e.𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵, it can be claimed by holder with preimage of hashlock. </p>\n<p>\\\n• holder: The holder can call 𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑒 () to exercise the option before 𝑇𝐸. </p>\n<p>\\\n• writer: The writer can call𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑢𝑛𝑑 () to retrieve the guarantee or retrieve it directly after 𝑇𝐸 + 2Δ.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐷 , the following elements are defined:</p>\n<p>\\\n• T_W: The deadline for seller to reveal signature. </p>\n<p>\\\n• buyer: writer position buyer, i.e. Dave. </p>\n<p>\\\n• seller: writer position seller, i.e. Bob. </p>\n<p>\\\n• old<em>exercise</em>hashlock: The hashlock of exercise, if Bob reveals during the transfer, Dave is able to reclaim with preimage. </p>\n<p>\\\n• exercise_hashlock: The new hashlock of exercise, generated by Dave. </p>\n<p>\\\n• old<em>writer</em>transfer<em>public</em>key: Bob’s transfer public key, used for verify the signature of Bob. </p>\n<p>\\\n• writer<em>transfer</em>public_key: New transfer public key generated by Dave, used for replacing Bob’s key. </p>\n<p>\\\n• transfer_time: Used for record the time of transfer (the time reveal signature) and calculate the withdrawal delayed period.</p>\n<p>\\\nTake Bob transferring his position to Dave as an example, since Bob deposit 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 into the contracts, which is more complex. Transferring Alice’s position to Carol is more simple.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy Lemma 11, if compliant Bob loses his position, he will at least obtain Dave’s collateral during the writer transfer process.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf Dave is conforming, then if Bob acts maliciously on his own, Bob provides two different signatures to different buyers, Dave can reclaim the transfer fee with extracted 𝑠𝑘𝐵 since 𝐷 records old<em>writer</em>transfer<em>public</em>key i.e. 𝑝𝑘𝐵. If Bob reveals 𝐵 at the same time during transfer process, then Dave can use 𝐵 to reclaim 𝑊 𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 since 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 records old<em>exercise</em>hashlock i.e. 𝐻(𝐵). If Alice and Bob collude, they can use 𝑠𝑘𝐵 or 𝐵 to withdraw 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵. Then, Dave can observe 𝑠𝑘𝐵 or 𝐵 and withdraw 𝑊 𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 during withdrawal delay period since 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐷 records transfer_time.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf Alice is conforming, then If Bob provides two different signatures to different buyers, Alice can extract 𝑠𝑘𝐵 and submit it to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵. If Bob or Dave publishes one signature exclusively on either 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 or 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵, Alice can forward this signature to another chain to make sure the exercise secret hashlocks are consistent on two chains. If Bob and Dave collude, they use two signatures to change the hashlock. During the withdrawal delay period, Alice can obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 using the extracted 𝑠𝑘𝐵.</p>\n<p>\\\nTransferring Alice’s position to Carol is simpler, as Alice does not deposit assets into the option contracts and cannot modify the exercise secret hashlock. Carol only needs to ensure consistency between the holders on the two chains. Otherwise, she can extract 𝑠𝑘𝐴 and refund the 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 during the withdrawal delay period.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 5. <em>Protocol 4.2.2 satisfies isolation: Alice and Bob can simultaneously and separately transfer their positions to Carol and Dave, respectively. This means that transferring holder and the transferring writer can proceed concurrently.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. Suppose both Carol and Dave are interested in Alice’s and Bob’s positions, respectively. According to Lemma 9, Alice transferring to Carol does not require Bob’s involvement, hence Alice and Carol will not be interfered with. Similarly, it is known that during Bob’s transfer to Dave, by Lemma 10, if Bob and Dave are both compliant, Alice does not need to participate. Considering the case when Bob reveals two different signatures: (i) If Carol has already revealed the secret value 𝐶 of the transfer hash lock, then Carol becomes the new holder and can use two different signatures by 𝑠𝐵 to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 . (ii) If Carol has not revealed 𝐶 and will reveal it after Δ, Carol can simultaneously reveal𝐶 and call 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑖𝑚() on both chains after Δ to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 . If Dave or Bob publishes 𝜎𝑚 on one single chain, Carol must forward 𝜎𝑚 to the other chain while revealing 𝐶.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zifan Peng, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (zpengao@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(2) Yingjie Xue, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (yingjiexue@hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(3) Jingyu Liu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (jliu514@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"What Happens to Relicensed Open Source Projects and Their Forks?","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/2012251/what-happens-to-relicensed-open-source-projects-and-their-forks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735418040,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"A Linux Foundation project focused on understanding the health of the open source community just studied the outcomes for three projects that switched to \"more restrictive\" licenses and then faced community forks. \n\nThe data science director for the project &mdash; known as Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software (or CHAOSS) &mdash; is also an OpenUK board member, and describes the outcomes for OpenSearch, Redis with fork Valkey, and Terraform:\n\n\nThe relicensed project (Redis) had significant numbers of contributors who were not employed by the company, and the fork (Valkey) was created by those existing contributors as a foundation project... The Redis project differs from Elasticsearch and Terraform in the number of contributions to the Redis repository from people who were not employees of Redis. In the year leading up to the relicense, when Redis was still open source, there were substantial contributions from employees of other companies: Twice as many non-Redis employees made five or more commits, and about a dozen employees of other companies made almost twice as many commits as Redis employees made. \n\nIn the six months after the relicense, all of the external contributors from companies (including Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and Ericsson) who contributed over five commits to the Redis project in the year prior to the relicense stopped contributing. In sum, Redis had strong organizational diversity before the relicense, but only Redis employees made significant contributions afterward. \n\nValkey was forked from Redis 7.2.4 on March 28, 2024, as a Linux Foundation project under the BSD-3 license. The fork was driven by a group of people who previously contributed to Redis with public support from their employers. Within its first six months, the Valkey repository had 29 contributors employed at 10 companies, and 18 of those people previously contributed to Redis. Valkey has a diverse set of contributors from various companies, with Amazon having the most contributors. \nThe results weren't always so clear-cut. Because Terraform always had very few contributors outside of the company, \"there was no substantial impact on the contributor community from the relicensing event...\" (Although the OpenTofu fork &mdash; a Linux Foundation project &mdash; had 31 people at 11 organizations who made five or more contributions.) \n\nAnd both before and after Elasticsearch's relicensing, most contributors were Elastic employees, so \"the 2021 relicense had little to no impact on contributors.\" (But the OpenSearch fork &mdash; transferred in September to the Linux Foundation &mdash; shows a more varied contributor base, with just 63% of additions and 64% of deletions coming from Amazon employees who made 10 or more commits. Six people who didn't work for Amazon made 10 or more commits, making up 11% of additions and 13% of deletions.\") \n\nSo \"Looking at all of these projects together, we see that the forks from relicensed projects tend to have more organizational diversity than the original projects,\" they conclude, adding that in general \"projects with greater organizational diversity tend to be more sustainable...\" \n\n\"You can dive into the details about these six projects in the paper, presentation and data we shared at the recent OpenForum Academy Symposium.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=What+Happens+to+Relicensed+Open+Source+Projects+and+Their+Forks%3F+%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F2012251%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F2012251%2Fwhat-happens-to-relicensed-open-source-projects-and-their-forks%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/2012251/what-happens-to-relicensed-open-source-projects-and-their-forks?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563559&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Magnus Carlsen Quits Chess Tournament After Refusing to Change Out of Jeans","url":"https://games.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/1759232/magnus-carlsen-quits-chess-tournament-after-refusing-to-change-out-of-jeans?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735414440,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":" Magnus Carlsen quit the World Rapid Chess Championship on Friday, reports CNN, \"after he refused to change out of the jeans he was wearing...\" \n\n\"Carlsen, the world champion from 2013 until 2023, allegedly replied, 'I'm out, f*** you,' after being informed that he would not be permitted to continue,\" reports the Hindustan Times. \n\nThe International Chess Federation (or FIDE) \"said in a statement that Carlsen breached the tournament's dress code by wearing jeans,\" reports CNN:\n\n\nAs a result, Carlsen would not have been paired for round nine, though he could have returned for the rest of the tournament had he not decided to walk away, per Chess.com. Since he had performed poorly in the earlier rounds, there was little chance that Carlsen could have defended his title regardless.... \n\nThe standoff became \"a matter of principle\" for Carlsen, he told chess channel Take Take Take. \"I haven't appealed, honestly I'm too old at this point to care too much, if this is what they want to do ... nobody wants to back down, if this is where we are, that's fine by me,\" he said. \"I'll probably head off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer than here and that's it.\" He explained that he had been at a lunch meeting before heading to the tournament's second day and \"barely had time to go the room, change, put on a shirt, jacket and honestly I didn't even think about the jeans.\" \n\n\nCarlsen was also fined $200, according to the article. He has now also withdrawn from the World Blitz Championship which follows this tournament.\n\n In a statement, the FIDE said their dress code and other regulations \"are designed to ensure professionalism and fairness for all participants,\" and that the federation \"remains committed to promoting chess and its values, including respect for the rules that all participants agree to follow.\" \n\nThe group's CEO added \"Rules are applicable to all the participants, and it would be unfair towards all players who respected the dress-code, and those who were previously fined.\" (They added that \"We gave Magnus more than enough time to change.

The frontend extends the OpenAI API [34] interface, allowing users to customize sampling parameters for each request, such as the maximum sequence length and the beam width 𝑘. The vLLM engine is written in 8.5K lines of Python and 2K lines of C++/CUDA code. We develop control-related components including the scheduler and the block manager in Python while developing custom CUDA kernels for key operations such as PagedAttention. For the model executor, we implement popular LLMs such as GPT [5], OPT [62], and LLaMA [52] using</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-zt830gd.png\" alt=\"Figure 11. Input and output length distributions of the (a) ShareGPT and (b) Alpaca datasets.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nPyTorch [39] and Transformers [58]. We use NCCL [32] for tensor communication across the distributed GPU workers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"51kernelleveloptimization\">5.1 Kernel-level Optimization</h3>\n<p>Since PagedAttention introduces memory access patterns that are not efficiently supported by existing systems, we develop several GPU kernels for optimizing it. (1) Fused reshape and block write. In every Transformer layer, the new KV cache are split into blocks, reshaped to a memory layout optimized for block read, then saved at positions specified by the block table. To minimize kernel launch overheads, we fuse them into a single kernel. (2) Fusing block read and attention. We adapt the attention kernel in FasterTransformer [31] to read KV cache according to the block table and perform attention operations on the fly. To ensure coalesced memory access, we assign a GPU warp to read each block. Moreover, we add support for variable sequence lengths within a request batch. (3) Fused block copy. Block copy operations, issued by the copy-on-write mechanism, may operate on discontinuous blocks. This can lead to numerous invocations of small data movements if we use the cudaMemcpyAsync API. To mitigate the overhead, we implement a kernel that batches the copy operations for different blocks into a single kernel launch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"52supportingvariousdecodingalgorithms\">5.2 Supporting Various Decoding Algorithms</h3>\n<p>vLLM implements various decoding algorithms using three key methods: fork, append, and free. The fork method creates a new sequence from an existing one. The append method appends a new token to the sequence. Finally, the free method deletes the sequence. For instance, in parallel sampling, vLLM creates multiple output sequences from the single input sequence using the fork method. It then adds new tokens to these sequences in every iteration with append, and deletes sequences that meet a stopping condition using free. The same strategy is also applied in beam search and prefix sharing by vLLM. We believe future decoding algorithms can also be supported by combining these methods.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

Spread out over 25 years, the legislation collects an average of $3 billion each year &mdash; or $75 billion &mdash; \"from the parties most responsible for causing the climate crisis &mdash; big oil and gas companies.\" \n\n\"The Climate Change Superfund Act is now law, and New York has fired a shot that will be heard round the world: the companies most responsible for the climate crisis will be held accountable,\" said Senator Krueger. \"Too often over the last decade, courts have dismissed lawsuits against the oil and gas industry by saying that the issue of climate culpability should be decided by legislatures. Well, the Legislature of the State of New York &mdash; the 10th largest economy in the world &mdash; has accepted the invitation, and I hope we have made ourselves very clear: the planet's largest climate polluters bear a unique responsibility for creating the climate crisis, and they must pay their fair share to help regular New Yorkers deal with the consequences. \n\n\"And there's no question that those consequences are here, and they are serious,\" Krueger continued. \"Repairing from and preparing for extreme weather caused by climate change will cost more than half a trillion dollars statewide by 2050. That's over $65,000 per household, and that's on top of the disruption, injury, and death that the climate crisis is causing in every corner of our state. The Climate Change Superfund Act is a critical piece of affordability legislation that will deliver billions of dollars every year to ease the burden on regular New Yorkers....\" \n\nStarting in the 1970s, scientists working for Exxon made \"remarkably accurate projections of just how much burning fossil fuels would warm the planet.\" Yet for years, \"the oil giant publicly cast doubt on climate science, and cautioned against any drastic move away from burning fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change.\"\n \n\"The oil giant Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia could be slapped with the largest annual assessment of any company &mdash; $640 million a year &mdash; for emitting 31,269 million tons of greenhouse gases from 2000 to 2020,\" notes the New York Post. \n\nAnd \"The law will also standardize the number of emissions tied to the fuel produced by companies,\" reports the Times Union newspaper. \"[F]or every 1 million pounds of coal, for example, the program assigns over 942 metric tons of carbon dioxide. For every 1 million barrels of crude oil, an entity is considered to have produced 432,180 metric tons of carbon dioxide.\"\n\nAmong the infrastructure programs the superfund program aims to pay for: coastal wetlands restoration, energy efficient cooling systems in buildings, including schools and new housing developments, and stormwater drainage upgrades. \n\n\n New York is now the second U.S. state with a \"climate Superfund\" law, according to Bloomberg Law, with New York following the lead of Vermont. \"Maryland, Massachusetts, and California are also considering climate Superfund laws to manage mounting infrastructure costs.\"\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, which represents about 600 members of the industry, condemned the law. \"This type of legislation represents nothing more than a punitive new fee on American energy, and we are evaluating our options moving forward,\" an API spokesperson said in an emailed statement... The bills &mdash; modeled after the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, known as Superfund &mdash; would almost certainly spur swift litigation from fossil fuel companies upon enactment, legal educators say.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=New+York+Passes+Law+Making+Fossil+Fuel+Companies+Pay+%2475+Billion+for+'Climate+Superfund'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0613231%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0613231%2Fnew-york-passes-law-making-fossil-fuel-companies-pay-75-billion-for-climate-superfund%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/0613231/new-york-passes-law-making-fossil-fuel-companies-pay-75-billion-for-climate-superfund?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563195&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"LLaVA-Phi: The Training We Put It Through","url":"https://hackernoon.com/llava-phi-the-training-we-put-it-through?source=rss","date":1735410611,"author":"Writings, Papers and Blogs on Text Models","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/0xvVYI3OvJLvwRUYFnhV\">Abstract and 1 Introduction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/Jo6taCeMb5To49SvqmUy\">2.

LLaVA-Phi</h2>\n<p>Our overall network architecture is similar to LLaVA-1.5. We use the pre-trained CLIP ViT-L/14 with a resolution of 336x336 as the visual encoder. A two-layer MLP is adopted to improve the connection of the visual encoder and LLM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"31training\">3.1. Training</h2>\n<p><strong>Supervised fine-tuning on Phi-2.</strong> The publicly released Phi-2 model has not undergone fine-tuning. Previous research indicates that even a small amount of high-quality data can significantly enhance performance in areas such as mathematics, language reasoning, and coding tasks. In light of this, we employed supervised fine-tuning to further train Phi-2 using a select set of premium data. This data was organized in the Vicuna format. For our Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data, we utilized ShareGPT from an open-source platform. The training was conducted over two epochs, beginning with an initial learning rate of 3e-5, which was linearly decreased over time. Our findings suggest that while this step might be optional, applying SFT to Phi-2 does result in modest improvements across most benchmarks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-1283xx7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-u793xy7.png\" alt=\"Figure 3. LLaVA-Phi is capable of performing accurate OCR on mathematical equations and solving them correspondingly.\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Training LLaVA-Phi.</strong> Our training approach follows the pipeline used for LLaVA1.5, consisting of a pretraining stage and a subsequent instruction tuning phase. Initially, we kept the vision encoder and Phi-2 static, focusing exclusively on training the efficient projector. This step is followed by a comprehensive fine-tuning of both the projector and the language model (LLM), aiming to enhance their capabilities in visual comprehension and language processing.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor pre-training, we utilize a filtered subset of the CC-595K dataset [24] over one epoch, applying an initial learning rate of 1e-3 and a batch size of 256. Then, we finetune the model on LLaVA-Instruct-150K dataset for 1 epoch at a learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 256. We implement a weight decay of 0.1 and utilize the Adam optimizer, characterized by momentum parameters of 0.9 and 0.98, and an epsilon value of 1e-7. We fine-tune all parameters in LLM instead of using LoRA.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Computational Cost.</strong> Similar to LLaVA1.5, our training process is structured in two stages. For LLaVA-Phi, the pretraining phase takes 1.5 hours, followed by 8 hours dedicated to visual instruction tuning, utilizing 8 A100 GPUs. The integration of techniques such as LoRA [15] and QLoRA [9] has the potential to significantly reduce training time, a possibility we plan to explore in future work.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02330\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Yichen Zhu, Midea Group;</p>\n<p>(2) Minjie Zhu, Midea Group and East China Normal University;</p>\n<p>(3) Ning Liu, Midea Group;</p>\n<p>(4) Zhicai Ou, Midea Group;</p>\n<p>(5) Xiaofeng Mou, Midea Group.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Distributed Execution of vLLM","url":"https://hackernoon.com/the-distributed-execution-of-vllm?source=rss","date":1735407910,"author":"Writings, Papers and Blogs on Text Models","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/UZfnXsE8xpuPm7xJGzSd\">Abstract and 1 Introduction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/Joq6DOP9CkD0S4F8MX1r\">2 Background and 2.1 Transformer-Based Large Language Models</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/25g0m9nrxol991ZY9qci\">2.2 LLM Service & Autoregressive Generation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/IQ9Fd8hlh5MpHVMFA27O\">2.3 Batching Techniques for LLMs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/ytSMq2pxVtKIRC7iS3kK\">3 Memory Challenges in LLM Serving</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/6BZmg60VAii9DNx0L1qc\">3.1 Memory Management in Existing Systems</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/ZzGN1QRkg16N6zN7hCJi\">4 Method and 4.1 PagedAttention</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/4Da8juHWnURn6g4urrl4\">4.2 KV Cache Manager</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/GieTLdxmIGxSHDideqV5\">4.3 Decoding with PagedAttention and vLLM</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/7g3isP8BzgyEsTasNUr2\">4.4 Application to Other Decoding Scenarios</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/TEjiBAga2TDQ1ZZp5Vbg\">4.5 Scheduling and Preemption</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/OjYLeVPi5jM2NSWKvipy\">4.6 Distributed Execution</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/yqADDmfsCggYCcSdA6Nj\">5 Implementation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/S6sF02nTOzlXKZE1iQcP\">6 Evaluation and 6.1 Experimental Setup</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/K3TeA7MNOi0g142ICu5W\">6.2 Basic Sampling</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/cJxKQHExtKQrburnndpo\">6.3 Parallel Sampling and Beam Search</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/JEOm7WvIfRfxEjepPqXW\">6.4 Shared prefix</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/DWk5D3KHLfKhdQC02ayZ\">6.5 Chatbot</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/l7VvLlkEDSBJ5GzMlwJf\">7 Ablation Studies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/PJb0S41IDQAbwYp0e6RZ\">8 Discussion</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/5d2sL9hRMUBNmVCZWMBC\">9 Related Work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/HL77hmYOoM9MPB5fKgmq\">10 Conclusion, Acknowledgement and References</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"46distributedexecution\">4.6 Distributed Execution</h2>\n<p>Many LLMs have parameter sizes exceeding the capacity of a single GPU [5, 9]. Therefore, it is necessary to partition them across distributed GPUs and execute them in a model parallel fashion [28, 63]. This calls for a memory manager capable of handling distributed memory. vLLM is effective in distributed settings by supporting the widely used Megatron-LM style tensor model parallelism strategy on Transformers [47].

Specifically, the attention operator is split on the attention head dimension, each SPMD process takes care of a subset of attention heads in multi-head attention.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe observe that even with model parallel execution, each model shard still processes the same set of input tokens, thus requiring the KV Cache for the same positions. Therefore, vLLM features a single KV cache manager within the centralized scheduler, as in Fig. 4. Different GPU workers share the manager, as well as the mapping from logical blocks to physical blocks. This common mapping allows GPU workers to execute the model with the physical blocks provided by the scheduler for each input request. Although each GPU worker has the same physical block IDs, a worker only stores a portion of the KV cache for its corresponding attention heads.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn each step, the scheduler first prepares the message with input token IDs for each request in the batch, as well as the block table for each request. Next, the scheduler broadcasts this control message to the GPU workers. Then, the GPU workers start to execute the model with the input token IDs. In the attention layers, the GPU workers read the KV cache according to the block table in the control message. </p>\n<p>\\\nDuring execution, the GPU workers synchronize the intermediate results with the all-reduce communication primitive without the coordination of the scheduler, as in [47]. In the end, the GPU workers send the sampled tokens of this iteration back to the scheduler. In summary, GPU workers do not need to synchronize on memory management as they only need to receive all the memory management information at the beginning of each decoding iteration along with the step inputs.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

In vLLM, we adopt the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy for all requests, ensuring fairness and preventing starvation. When vLLM needs to preempt requests, it ensures that the earliest arrived requests are served first and the latest requests are preempted first.</p>\n<p>\\\nLLM services face a unique challenge: the input prompts for an LLM can vary significantly in length, and the resulting output lengths are not known a priori, contingent on both the input prompt and the model. As the number of requests and their outputs grow, vLLM can run out of the GPU’s physical blocks to store the newly generated KV cache. There are two classic questions that vLLM needs to answer in this context: (1) Which blocks should it evict? (2) How to recover evicted blocks if needed again? </p>\n<p>\\\nTypically, eviction policies use heuristics to predict which block will be accessed furthest in the future and evict that block. Since in our case we know that all blocks of a sequence are accessed together, we implement an all-or-nothing eviction policy, i.e., either evict all or none of the blocks of a sequence. Furthermore, multiple sequences within one request (e.g., beam candidates in one beam search request) are gang-scheduled as a sequence group. The sequences within one sequence group are always preempted or rescheduled together due to potential memory sharing across those sequences. To answer the second question of how to recover an evicted block, we consider two techniques:</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Swapping</strong>. This is the classic technique used by most virtual memory implementations which copy the evicted pages to a swap space on the disk. In our case, we copy evicted blocks to the CPU memory. As shown in Fig. 4, besides the GPU block allocator, vLLM includes a CPU block allocator to manage the physical blocks swapped to CPU RAM. When vLLM exhausts free physical blocks for new tokens, it selects a set of sequences to evict and transfer their KV cache to the CPU. </p>\n<p>\\\nOnce it preempts a sequence and evicts its blocks, vLLM stops accepting new requests until all preempted sequences are completed. Once a request completes, its blocks are freed from memory, and the blocks of a preempted sequence are brought back in to continue the processing of that sequence. Note that with this design, the number of blocks swapped to the CPU RAM never exceeds the number of total physical blocks in the GPU RAM, so the swap space on the CPU RAM is bounded by the GPU memory allocated for the KV cache.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Recomputation</strong>. In this case, we simply recompute the KV cache when the preempted sequences are rescheduled. Note that recomputation latency can be significantly lower than the original latency, as the tokens generated at decoding can be concatenated with the original user prompt as a new prompt—their KV cache at all positions can be generated in one prompt phase iteration.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe performances of swapping and recomputation depend on the bandwidth between CPU RAM and GPU memory and the computation power of the GPU. We examine the speeds of swapping and recomputation in §7.3.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

Related Work</h2>\n<p>The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly propelled the development of vision-language models based on LLMs. These models, representing a departure from the capabilities of the preLLM era, are equipped with advanced question-answering and visual comprehension skills. This progress is enabled by using LLMs as language encoding modules. Notable research in this domain includes the LLaVA-family [24, 25, 26, 32], the BLIP-family [8, 20], MiniGPT-4 [37], and others. Each has demonstrated significant advancements in managing visual-centric dialogues. However, a common limitation of these open-sourced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is their substantial computational demands, typically ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. This requirement poses challenges for deployment on edge or mobile devices, especially in real-time applications. Gemini [33], a leader in this field, has released three versions of visionlanguage models, including the compact Gemini-Nano with 1.8B/3.25B parameters, tailored for smartphones. However, their models and data are not open-sourced. Another initiative, MobileVLM [6], has developed mobileLLaMA with 2.7B parameters to facilitate smaller vision-language models. Our paper explores and demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating vision-language models with open-sourced, smaller language models, assessing their potential and efficiency in a variety of applications.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-0h83x51.png\" alt=\"Figure 1.

In many successful LLM applications [18, 34], an LLM service must offer more complex decoding scenarios that exhibit complex accessing patterns and more opportunities for memory sharing. We show the general applicability of vLLM on them in this section.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Parallel sampling.</strong> In LLM-based program assistants [6, 18], an LLM generates multiple sampled outputs for a single input prompt; users can choose a favorite output from various candidates. So far we have implicitly assumed that a request</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-4x830j1.png\" alt=\"Figure 8. Parallel sampling example.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\ngenerates a single sequence. In the remainder of this paper, we assume the more general case in which a request generates multiple sequences. In parallel sampling, one request includes multiple samples sharing the same input prompt, allowing the KV cache of the prompt to be shared as well. Via its PagedAttention and paged memory management, vLLM can realize this sharing easily and save memory.</p>\n<p>\\\nFig. 8 shows an example of parallel decoding for two outputs. Since both outputs share the same prompt, we only reserve space for one copy of the prompt’s state at the prompt phase; the logical blocks for the prompts of both sequences are mapped to the same physical blocks: the logical block 0 and 1 of both sequences are mapped to physical blocks 7 and 1, respectively. Since a single physical block can be mapped to multiple logical blocks, we introduce a reference count for each physical block. In this case, the reference counts for physical blocks 7 and 1 are both 2. At the generation phase, the two outputs sample different output tokens and need separate storage for KV cache. vLLM implements a copy-onwrite mechanism at the block granularity for the physical blocks that need modification by multiple sequences, similar to the copy-on-write technique in OS virtual memory (e.g., when forking a process). Specifically, in Fig. 8, when sample A1 needs to write to its last logical block (logical block 1), vLLM recognizes that the reference count of the corresponding physical block (physical block 1) is greater than 1; it allocates a new physical block (physical block 3), instructs the block engine to copy the information from physical block 1, and decreases the reference count to 1. Next, when sample A2 writes to physical block 1, the reference count is already reduced to 1; thus A2 directly writes its newly generated KV cache to physical block 1.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn summary, vLLM enables the sharing of most of the space used to store the prompts’ KV cache across multiple output samples, with the exception of the final logical block, which is managed by a copy-on-write mechanism. By sharing physical blocks across multiple samples, memory usage can be greatly reduced, especially for long input prompts.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Beam search.</strong> In LLM tasks like machine translation [59], the users expect the top-𝑘 most appropriate translations output by the LLM. Beam search [49] is widely used to decode the most probable output sequence from an LLM, as it mitigates the computational complexity of fully traversing the</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-26930hy.png\" alt=\"Figure 9. Beam search example.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nsample space. The algorithm relies on the beam width parameter 𝑘, which determines the number of top candidates retained at every step. During decoding, beam search expands each candidate sequence in the beam by considering all possible tokens, computes their respective probabilities using the LLM, and retains the top-𝑘 most probable sequences out of 𝑘 · |𝑉 | candidates, where |𝑉 | is the vocabulary size.</p>\n<p>\\\nUnlike parallel decoding, beam search facilities sharing not only the initial prompt blocks but also other blocks across different candidates, and the sharing patterns dynamically change as the decoding process advances, similar to the process tree in the OS created by compound forks. Fig. 9 shows how vLLM manages the KV blocks for a beam search example with 𝑘 = 4. Prior to the iteration illustrated as the dotted line, each candidate sequence has used 4 full logical blocks. All beam candidates share the first block 0 (i.e., prompt). Candidate 3 digresses from others from the second block. Candidates 0-2 share the first 3 blocks and diverge at the fourth block. At subsequent iterations, the top-4 probable candidates all originate from candidates 1 and 2. As the original candidates 0 and 3 are no longer among the top candidates, their logical blocks are freed, and the reference counts of corresponding physical blocks are reduced. vLLM frees all physical blocks whose reference counts reach 0 (blocks 2, 4, 5, 8). Then, vLLM allocates new physical blocks (blocks 9-12) to store the new KV cache from the new candidates. Now, all candidates share blocks 0, 1, 3; candidates 0 and 1 share block 6, and candidates 2 and 3 further share block 7.</p>\n<p>\\\nPrevious LLM serving systems require frequent memory copies of the KV cache across the beam candidates. For example, in the case shown in Fig. 9, after the dotted line, candidate 3 would need to copy a large portion of candidate 2’s KV cache to continue generation. This frequent memory copy overhead is significantly reduced by vLLM’s physical block sharing. In vLLM, most blocks of different beam candidates can be shared. The copy-on-write mechanism is applied only when the newly generated tokens are within an old shared block, as in parallel decoding. This involves only copying one block of data.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Shared prefix.</strong> Commonly, the LLM user provides a (long) description of the task including instructions and example inputs and outputs, also known as system prompt [36]. The description is concatenated with the actual task input to form the prompt of the request. The LLM generates outputs based</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-6ca30va.png\" alt=\"Figure 10. Shared prompt example for machine translation. The examples are adopted from [5].\" /></p>\n<p>\\\non the full prompt. Fig. 10 shows an example. Moreover, the shared prefix can be further tuned, via prompt engineering, to improve the accuracy of the downstream tasks [26, 27].</p>\n<p>\\\nFor this type of application, many user prompts share a prefix, thus the LLM service provider can store the KV cache of the prefix in advance to reduce the redundant computation spent on the prefix. In vLLM, this can be conveniently achieved by reserving a set of physical blocks for a set of predefined shared prefixes by the LLM service provider, as how OS handles shared library across processes. A user input prompt with the shared prefix can simply map its logical blocks to the cached physical blocks (with the last block marked copy-on-write). The prompt phase computation only needs to execute on the user’s task input.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Mixed decoding methods.</strong> The decoding methods discussed earlier exhibit diverse memory sharing and accessing patterns. Nonetheless, vLLM facilitates the simultaneous processing of requests with different decoding preferences, which existing systems cannot efficiently do. This is because vLLM conceals the complex memory sharing between different sequences via a common mapping layer that translates logical blocks to physical blocks.

Instead, it reserves only the necessary KV blocks to accommodate the KV cache generated during prompt computation. </p>\n<p>\\\nIn this case, The prompt has 7 tokens, so vLLM maps the first 2 logical KV blocks (0 and 1) to 2 physical KV blocks (7 and 1, respectively). In the prefill step, vLLM generates the KV cache of the prompts and the first output token with a conventional self-attention algorithm (e.g., [13]). vLLM then stores the KV cache of the first 4 tokens in logical block 0 and the following 3 tokens in logical block 1. The remaining slot is reserved for the subsequent autoregressive generation phase. 2 In the first autoregressive decoding step, vLLM generates the new token with the PagedAttention algorithm on physical blocks 7 and 1. </p>\n<p>\\\nSince one slot remains available in the last logical block, the newly generated KV cache is stored there, and the block table’s #filled record is updated. 3 At the second decoding step, as the last logical block is full, vLLM stores the newly generated KV cache in a new logical block; vLLM allocates a new physical block (physical block 3) for it and stores this mapping in the block table.</p>\n<p>\\\nGlobally, for each decoding iteration, vLLM first selects a set of candidate sequences for batching (more in §4.5), and allocates the physical blocks for the newly required logical blocks. Then, vLLM concatenates all the input tokens of the current iteration (i.e., all tokens for prompt phase</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-gd830l8.png\" alt=\"Figure 7. Storing the KV cache of two requests at the same time in vLLM.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nrequests and the latest tokens for generation phase requests) as one sequence and feeds it into the LLM. During LLM’s computation, vLLM uses the PagedAttention kernel to access the previous KV cache stored in the form of logical KV blocks and saves the newly generated KV cache into the physical KV blocks. Storing multiple tokens within a KV block (block size &gt; 1) enables the PagedAttention kernel to process the KV cache across more positions in parallel, thus increasing the hardware utilization and reducing latency. However, a larger block size also increases memory fragmentation. We study the effect of block size in §7.2.</p>\n<p>\\\nAgain, vLLM dynamically assigns new physical blocks to logical blocks as more tokens and their KV cache are generated. As all the blocks are filled from left to right and a new physical block is only allocated when all previous blocks are full, vLLM limits all the memory wastes for a request within one block, so it can effectively utilize all the memory, as shown in Fig. 2. </p>\n<p>\\\nThis allows more requests to fit into memory for batching—hence improving the throughput. Once a request finishes its generation, its KV blocks can be freed to store the KV cache of other requests. In Fig. 7, we show an example of vLLM managing the memory for two sequences. The logical blocks of the two sequences are mapped to different physical blocks within the space reserved by the block engine in GPU workers. The neighboring logical blocks of both sequences do not need to be contiguous in physical GPU memory and the space of physical blocks can be effectively utilized by both sequences.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

LLaVA-Phi marks a notable advancement in the realm of compact multi-modal models. It demonstrates that even smaller language models, with as few as 2.7B parameters, can effectively engage in intricate dialogues that integrate both textual and visual elements, provided they are trained with high-quality corpora. Our model delivers commendable performance on publicly available benchmarks that encompass visual comprehension, reasoning, and knowledge-based perception. Beyond its remarkable performance in multi-modal dialogue tasks, our model opens new avenues for applications in timesensitive environments and systems that require real-time interaction, such as embodied agents. It highlights the potential of smaller language models to achieve sophisticated levels of understanding and interaction, while maintaining greater resource efficiency.

Introduction</h2>\n<p>Large vision language models, including Flamingo [1], GPT-4V [30], and Gemini [33], have exhibited remarkable proficiency in executing instructions, engaging in multi-turn dialogues, and handling image-based question-answering tasks. The progression of open-source vision language models has been significantly propelled by the rapid advancement of open-source Large Language Models like LLaMA [34] and Vicuna [5]. These developments primarily focus on leveraging language models with a minimum of 7B parameters, integrated with a vision encoder to enhance visual comprehension. However, this approach often results in increased test time and reduced inference speed, which are less than ideal for time-sensitive or real-time interactive applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. This leads to an important inquiry: How effectively can small vision-language assistants perform in comparison?</p>\n<p>\\\nGemini [33] has blazed a trail for multi-modal models in mobile technology. Its streamlined variant, Gemini-Nano, boasts 1.8/3.25 billion parameters and is deployable on mobile devices. However, details like the model architecture, training data, and training methodologies remain proprietary and inaccessible to the public. In the realm of small language models, there have been notable advancements: TinyGSM [23], with 2.6 billion parameters, achieves over 80% accuracy on the GSM8k [7] benchmark. Additionally, models such as Phi [13] have demonstrated capabilities in language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and code generation, rivaling larger language models like LLaMA2-7B. This progress underscores the significant strides being made in the efficiency and effectiveness of smaller-scale language models.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Phi, a compact vision-language assistant powered by a small language model. Our work combines the powerful opensourced multi-modal model, LLaVA-1.5 [24], with the best-performing open-sourced small language models, Phi2 [21]. We follow a two-stage training pipeline and leverage high-quality visual instruction tuning data from LLaVA. LLaVA-Phi was evaluated across eight diverse benchmarks. Despite possessing only 3 billion parameters, it achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, some larger multi-modal models that are three times larger. </p>\n<p>\\\nNotably, LLaVA-Phi-3B demonstrates exceptional proficiency in ScienceQA [28], outperforming existing large multimodal models. Additionally, we qualitatively demonstrate LLaVA-Phi’s strong generalization ability in handling challenging questions, generating code based on instructions, and solving mathematical problems.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02330\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n(1) Yichen Zhu, Midea Group;</p>\n<p>(2) Minjie Zhu, Midea Group and East China Normal University;</p>\n<p>(3) Ning Liu, Midea Group;</p>\n<p>(4) Zhicai Ou, Midea Group;</p>\n<p>(5) Xiaofeng Mou, Midea Group.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"KV Cache Manager: The Key Idea Behind It and How It Works","url":"https://hackernoon.com/kv-cache-manager-the-key-idea-behind-it-and-how-it-works?source=rss","date":1735404311,"author":"Writings, Papers and Blogs on Text Models","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/UZfnXsE8xpuPm7xJGzSd\">Abstract and 1 Introduction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/Joq6DOP9CkD0S4F8MX1r\">2 Background and 2.1 Transformer-Based Large Language Models</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/25g0m9nrxol991ZY9qci\">2.2 LLM Service & Autoregressive Generation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/IQ9Fd8hlh5MpHVMFA27O\">2.3 Batching Techniques for LLMs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/ytSMq2pxVtKIRC7iS3kK\">3 Memory Challenges in LLM Serving</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/6BZmg60VAii9DNx0L1qc\">3.1 Memory Management in Existing Systems</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/ZzGN1QRkg16N6zN7hCJi\">4 Method and 4.1 PagedAttention</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/4Da8juHWnURn6g4urrl4\">4.2 KV Cache Manager</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/GieTLdxmIGxSHDideqV5\">4.3 Decoding with PagedAttention and vLLM</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/7g3isP8BzgyEsTasNUr2\">4.4 Application to Other Decoding Scenarios</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/TEjiBAga2TDQ1ZZp5Vbg\">4.5 Scheduling and Preemption</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/OjYLeVPi5jM2NSWKvipy\">4.6 Distributed Execution</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/yqADDmfsCggYCcSdA6Nj\">5 Implementation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/S6sF02nTOzlXKZE1iQcP\">6 Evaluation and 6.1 Experimental Setup</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/K3TeA7MNOi0g142ICu5W\">6.2 Basic Sampling</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/cJxKQHExtKQrburnndpo\">6.3 Parallel Sampling and Beam Search</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/JEOm7WvIfRfxEjepPqXW\">6.4 Shared prefix</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/DWk5D3KHLfKhdQC02ayZ\">6.5 Chatbot</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/l7VvLlkEDSBJ5GzMlwJf\">7 Ablation Studies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/PJb0S41IDQAbwYp0e6RZ\">8 Discussion</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/5d2sL9hRMUBNmVCZWMBC\">9 Related Work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/HL77hmYOoM9MPB5fKgmq\">10 Conclusion, Acknowledgement and References</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"42kvcachemanager\">4.2 KV Cache Manager</h2>\n<p>The key idea behind vLLM’s memory manager is analogous to the virtual memory [25] in operating systems. OS partitions memory into fixed-sized pages and maps user programs’ logical pages to physical pages. Contiguous logical pages can correspond to non-contiguous physical memory pages, allowing user programs to access memory as though it were contiguous. Moreover, physical memory space needs not to be fully reserved in advance, enabling the OS to dynamically allocate physical pages as needed. vLLM uses the ideas behind virtual memory to manage the KV cache in an LLM service. Enabled by PagedAttention, we organize the KV cache as fixed-size KV blocks, like pages in virtual memory.</p>\n<p>\\\nA request’s KV cache is represented as a series of logical KV blocks, filled from left to right as new tokens and their KV cache are generated. The last KV block’s unfilled positions are reserved for future generations. On GPU workers, a block engine allocates a contiguous chunk of GPU DRAM and</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-95830ir.png\" alt=\"Figure 6. Block table translation in vLLM.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\ndivides it into physical KV blocks (this is also done on CPU RAM for swapping; see §4.5). The KV block manager also maintains block tables—the mapping between logical and physical KV blocks of each request. Each block table entry records the corresponding physical blocks of a logical block and the number of filled positions. Separating logical and physical KV blocks allows vLLM to dynamically grow the KV cache memory without reserving it for all positions in advance, which eliminates most memory waste in existing systems, as in Fig. 2.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

The architecture of vLLM is shown in Fig. 4. vLLM adopts a centralized scheduler to coordinate the execution of distributed GPU workers. The KV cache manager effectively manages the KV cache in a paged fashion, enabled by PagedAttention. Specifically, the KV cache manager manages the physical KV cache memory on the GPU workers through the instructions sent by the centralized scheduler.</p>\n<p>\\\nNext, We describe the PagedAttention algorithm in §4.1. With that, we show the design of the KV cache manager in §4.2 and how it facilitates PagedAttention in §4.3, respectively. Then, we show how this design facilitates effective memory management for various decoding methods (§4.4) and handles the variable length input and output sequences (§4.5). Finally, we show how the system design of vLLM works in a distributed setting (§4.6).</p>\n<h3 id=\"41pagedattention\">4.1 PagedAttention</h3>\n<p>To address the memory challenges in §3, we introduce PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classic idea of paging [25] in operating systems. Unlike the traditional attention algorithms, PagedAttention allows storing continuous keys and values in non-contiguous memory space. Specifically, PagedAttention partitions the KV cache of each sequence into KV blocks. Each block contains the key and value vectors for a fixed number of tokens,[1] which we denote as KV</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-2m830v6.png\" alt=\"Figure 5. Illustration of the PagedAttention algorithm, where the attention key and values vectors are stored as non-contiguous blocks in the memory.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nblock size (𝐵). Denote the key block 𝐾𝑗 = (𝑘(𝑗−1)𝐵+1, . . . , 𝑘𝑗𝐵) and value block 𝑉𝑗 = (𝑣(𝑗−1)𝐵+1, . . . , 𝑣𝑗𝐵). The attention computation in Eq. 4 can be transformed into the following block-wise computation:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-up930x7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nwhere 𝐴𝑖𝑗 = (𝑎𝑖,(𝑗−1)𝐵+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖,𝑗𝐵) is the row vector of attention score on 𝑗-th KV block.</p>\n<p>\\\nDuring the attention computation, the PagedAttention kernel identifies and fetches different KV blocks separately. We show an example of PagedAttention in Fig. 5: The key and value vectors are spread across three blocks, and the three blocks are not contiguous on the physical memory. At each time, the kernel multiplies the query vector 𝑞𝑖 of the query token (“forth”) and the key vectors 𝐾𝑗 in a block (e.g., key vectors of “Four score and seven” for block 0) to compute the attention score𝐴𝑖𝑗, and later multiplies𝐴𝑖𝑗 with the value vectors 𝑉𝑗 in a block to derive the final attention output 𝑜𝑖.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn summary, the PagedAttention algorithm allows the KV blocks to be stored in non-contiguous physical memory, which enables more flexible paged memory management in vLLM.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] In Transformer, each token has a set of key and value vectors across layers and attention heads within a layer. All the key and value vectors can be managed together within a single KV block, or the key and value vectors at different heads and layers can each have a separate block and be managed in separate block tables. The two designs have no performance difference and we choose the second one for easy implementation.</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

Due to the unpredictable output lengths from the LLM, they statically allocate a chunk of memory for a request based on the request’s maximum possible sequence length, irrespective of the actual input or eventual output length of the request.</p>\n<p>\\\nFig. 3 illustrates two requests: request A with 2048 maximum possible sequence length and request B with a maximum of 512. The chunk pre-allocation scheme in existing systems has three primary sources of memory wastes: reserved slots for future tokens, internal fragmentation due to over-provisioning for potential maximum sequence lengths, and external fragmentation from the memory allocator like the buddy allocator. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe external fragmentation will never be used for generated tokens, which is known before serving a request. Internal fragmentation also remains unused, but this is only realized after a request has finished sampling. They are both pure memory waste. </p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough the reserved memory is eventually used, reserving this space for the entire request’s duration, especially when the reserved space is large, occupies the space that could otherwise be used to process other requests. We visualize the average percentage of memory wastes in our experiments in Fig. 2, revealing that the actual effective memory in previous systems can be as low as 20.4%.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-2z830g5.png\" alt=\"Figure 4. vLLM system overview.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough compaction [54] has been proposed as a potential solution to fragmentation, performing compaction in a performance-sensitive LLM serving system is impractical due to the massive KV cache. Even with compaction, the pre-allocated chunk space for each request prevents memory sharing specific to decoding algorithms in existing memory management systems.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

The amount seemed reasonable given the career trajectory that both credentials promised, but that path never materialized. Working a series of low-wage jobs, she went in and out of forbearance before ultimately defaulting. The balance ballooned to the current $268,000 total over the years due to collection fees and interest capitalization. \n\nAnd she's not the only one in debt. \"On a dreary December afternoon, a group of senior citizens stood in the rain outside the Education Department pleading for relief from a debt that many fear will burden them for the rest of their lives...\"\nSome sat in rocking chairs, cross-stitching their debt number in a pattern. Others held signs that read, \"Time is running out, sunset our debt.\" Or wore T-shirts saying, \"Debt relief before we die....\" \n\n[A]ctivists are urging the U.S. Education Department to discharge the student debt of older borrowers who they say are in no position to repay. They say the department could use a little-known federal statute that considers a person's ability to pay within a reasonable time and the inability of the government to collect the debt in full. There are 2.8 million federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older with a total of $121.5 billion in debt, more than 726,300 of them over the age of 71, according to the Education Department. Older borrowers are one of the fastest-growing segments of the government's student loan portfolio, and their Social Security benefits are subject to garnishment... \n\nThe Education Department would only acknowledge receiving a memo from the Debt Collective, the group organizing the campaign, outlining the agency's authority to cancel the debt of older borrowers. The activist organization said it has been meeting with members of Congress, White House committees and Education Department officials about the matter since September. \"Many of these folks have been borrowers for 20 or 30 years, with punishingly high interest rates. Their balances and the way they have dragged on for decades is just an indictment of the broken system and the failure of past relief efforts,\" said Eleni Schirmer, an organizer with the Debt Collective... According to the think tank New America, the number of Americans approaching retirement age with student loan debt has skyrocketed over 500 percent in the last two decades. Some have loans they took out to finance their college educations, while others took out federal Parent Plus loans or co-signed private loans for their children. \nThe article points out that the U.S. government will garnish up to 15 percent of the Social Security income to recoup student loan debt, even if it means leaving recipients below the poverty line. \n\nBut it also includes this quote from Adam Minsky, an attorney who specializes in student debt, about the prospects for federal action that survives challenges in the U.S. court system. \"[A]s a practical matter, I don't think that judges and courts that have been hostile to mass debt relief would treat this differently from other programs that have been blocked or struck down.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Millions+of+US+Seniors+Still+Owe+Student+Loan+Debt%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0423232%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F28%2F0423232%2Fmillions-of-us-seniors-still-owe-student-loan-debt%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/12/28/0423232/millions-of-us-seniors-still-owe-student-loan-debt?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23563147&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Memory Challenges in LLM Serving: The Obstacles to Overcome","url":"https://hackernoon.com/memory-challenges-in-llm-serving-the-obstacles-to-overcome?source=rss","date":1735398014,"author":"Writings, Papers and Blogs on Text Models","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/UZfnXsE8xpuPm7xJGzSd\">Abstract and 1 Introduction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/Joq6DOP9CkD0S4F8MX1r\">2 Background and 2.1 Transformer-Based Large Language Models</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/25g0m9nrxol991ZY9qci\">2.2 LLM Service & Autoregressive Generation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/IQ9Fd8hlh5MpHVMFA27O\">2.3 Batching Techniques for LLMs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/ytSMq2pxVtKIRC7iS3kK\">3 Memory Challenges in LLM Serving</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/6BZmg60VAii9DNx0L1qc\">3.1 Memory Management in Existing Systems</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/ZzGN1QRkg16N6zN7hCJi\">4 Method and 4.1 PagedAttention</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/4Da8juHWnURn6g4urrl4\">4.2 KV Cache Manager</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/GieTLdxmIGxSHDideqV5\">4.3 Decoding with PagedAttention and vLLM</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/7g3isP8BzgyEsTasNUr2\">4.4 Application to Other Decoding Scenarios</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/TEjiBAga2TDQ1ZZp5Vbg\">4.5 Scheduling and Preemption</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/OjYLeVPi5jM2NSWKvipy\">4.6 Distributed Execution</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/yqADDmfsCggYCcSdA6Nj\">5 Implementation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/S6sF02nTOzlXKZE1iQcP\">6 Evaluation and 6.1 Experimental Setup</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/K3TeA7MNOi0g142ICu5W\">6.2 Basic Sampling</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/cJxKQHExtKQrburnndpo\">6.3 Parallel Sampling and Beam Search</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/JEOm7WvIfRfxEjepPqXW\">6.4 Shared prefix</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/DWk5D3KHLfKhdQC02ayZ\">6.5 Chatbot</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/l7VvLlkEDSBJ5GzMlwJf\">7 Ablation Studies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/PJb0S41IDQAbwYp0e6RZ\">8 Discussion</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/5d2sL9hRMUBNmVCZWMBC\">9 Related Work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/HL77hmYOoM9MPB5fKgmq\">10 Conclusion, Acknowledgement and References</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"3memorychallengesinllmserving\">3 Memory Challenges in LLM Serving</h2>\n<p>Although fine-grained batching reduces the waste of computing and enables requests to be batched in a more flexible way, the number of requests that can be batched together is still constrained by GPU memory capacity, particularly the space allocated to store the KV cache. In other words, the serving system’s throughput is memory-bound. Overcoming this memory-bound requires addressing the following challenges in the memory management:</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Large KV cache.</strong> The KV Cache size grows quickly with the number of requests. As an example, for the 13B parameter OPT model [62], the KV cache of a single token demands 800 KB of space, calculated as 2 (key and value vectors) × 5120 (hidden state size) × 40 (number of layers) × 2 (bytes per FP16). Since OPT can generate sequences up to 2048 tokens, the memory required to store the KV cache of one request can be as much as 1.6 GB. Concurrent GPUs have memory capacities in the tens of GBs. Even if all available memory was allocated to KV cache, only a few tens of requests could be accommodated. Moreover, inefficient memory management can further decrease the batch size, as shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, given the current trends, the GPU’s computation speed grows faster than the memory capacity [17]. For example, from NVIDIA A100 to H100, The FLOPS increases by more than 2x, but the GPU memory stays at 80GB maximum. Therefore, we believe the memory will become an increasingly significant bottleneck.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Complex decoding algorithms.</strong> LLM services offer a range of decoding algorithms for users to select from, each with varying implications for memory management complexity. For example, when users request multiple random samples from a single input prompt, a typical use case in program suggestion [18], the KV cache of the prompt part, which accounts for 12% of the total KV cache memory in our experiment (§6.3), can be shared to minimize memory usage. On the other hand, the KV cache during the autoregressive generation phase should remain unshared due to the different sample results and their dependence on context and position. The extent of KV cache sharing depends on the specific decoding algorithm employed. In more sophisticated algorithms like beam search [49], different request beams can share larger portions (up to 55% memory saving, see §6.3) of their KV cache, and the sharing pattern evolves as the decoding process advances.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Scheduling for unknown input & output lengths.</strong> The requests to an LLM service exhibit variability in their input and output lengths. This requires the memory management system to accommodate a wide range of prompt lengths. In addition, as the output length of a request grows at decoding, the memory required for its KV cache also expands and may exhaust available memory for incoming requests or ongoing generation for existing prompts. The system needs to make scheduling decisions, such as deleting or swapping out the KV cache of some requests from GPU memory.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Woosuk Kwon, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(2) Zhuohan Li, UC Berkeley with Equal contribution;</p>\n<p>(3) Siyuan Zhuang, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(4) Ying Sheng, UC Berkeley and Stanford University;</p>\n<p>(5) Lianmin Zheng, UC Berkeley;</p>\n<p>(6) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(7) Cody Hao Yu, Independent Researcher;</p>\n<p>(8) Joseph E.

A more tech-savvy user could reportedly connect vehicles to their owners' personal credentials, thanks to additional data accessible through VW Group's online services Crucially, in 466,000 of the 800,000 cases, the location data was so precise that anyone with access could create a detailed profile of each owner's daily habits.

It includes German politicians, entrepreneurs, Hamburg police officers (the entire EV fleet, no less), and even suspected intelligence service employees. Yes, even spies may have been caught up in this digital debacle.\n \nThis glaring error originated from Cariad, a VW Group company that focuses on software, due to an error that occurred in the summer of 2024. An anonymous whistleblower used freely accessible software to dig up the sensitive information and promptly alerted Chaos Computer Club (CCC), Europe's largest hacker association. CCC wasted no time contacting Lower Saxony's State Data Protection Officer, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and other security bodies. They also gave VW Group and Cariad 30 days to address the issue before going public.

I want to share my experience of developing an open-source library, talk about the process involved, and inspire you to create your own projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prehistory\">Prehistory</h2>\n<p>In the spring, while watching one of Yegor Bugaenko's streams — I was inspired by the idea of open-source development. Yegor asserted that if you want to go beyond being an ordinary developer and become a more sought-after and unique specialist, you need to create something of your own. Whether it’s a book, a blog, a library, or even a framework, such projects allow you to stand out among many other developers, especially in today's IT market. This not only demonstrates your professionalism but also shows genuine engagement in the development of the field.</p>\n<p>\\\nAll of this made me think: how do I really stand out among other developers? Despite years of working in IT and participating in various projects, I still didn’t have anything of my own — something that could showcase my uniqueness and professionalism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"searchingforideas\">Searching for Ideas</h2>\n<p>I revisited my old pet projects on GitHub, but quickly realized that none of them were truly significant. So, I decided to start from scratch and create something new. Full of motivation and enthusiasm, I began to think about what I could write that would be in demand, at least among a small audience, and that would match my skills.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor two or three days, I analyzed ideas for my open-source project. The more I pondered, the more it seemed that everything had already been written, and that what had yet to be realized would be impossible to achieve alone. Let me say right away: this is a misleading perspective. Don’t let it destroy your potential. Yes, much has already been created, but that’s no reason to give up and abandon the idea of creating something of your own.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Now, I’ll explain why:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s always a chance to catch a trend and create a tool or service that quickly becomes popular. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, websites were developed that provided real-time statistics on infections and the latest news. Currently, we are witnessing a trend toward AI services, which continues to gain momentum. All it takes is to seize the moment and offer a solution that is in demand during that period.</li>\n<li>It’s not necessary to be the first in a niche to conquer it. Let’s take Discord as an example: it appeared in 2015 when there were already established players like TeamSpeak, Ventrilo, Skype, and RaidCall. Yet, within just a few years, Discord became the leader in its segment. The key is not the novelty of the idea, but how effectively you address an existing problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe most important aspect of creating something new is to identify a real problem and offer a solution. This can be a global challenge or a small but significant issue that needs improvement. It’s crucial to understand what difficulties other developers or regular users face and how you can help them overcome these challenges.</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter further reflection, I felt a desire to create something useful for the .NET community — a small library that could facilitate project development. Since my primary focus is .NET, I decided to concentrate on what I already know and do well. One idea that came to mind was to create a library for tracking input events from the keyboard and mouse.</p>\n<p>\\\nA month before that, while working on a desktop application for Windows, I faced the task of tracking key presses on the keyboard to perform certain actions. The main nuance was that it needed to work regardless of whether our application was active. Since there were no ready-made solutions at that time, I utilized native <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke\">P/Invoke</a> calls and successfully achieved the desired result. At that moment, I didn’t consider that other developers might also face this issue and that a small library addressing this problem could be quite useful.</p>\n<p>\\\nYes, it’s not a library that will change anyone's life, but it’s the first step toward creating something of my own. It’s an opportunity to gain valuable experience and spend time engaging in something I am truly passionate about, which is why I decided to take action.</p>\n<h2 id=\"development\">Development</h2>\n<p>The first step was brainstorming ideas for the functionality my library would have. I wanted its capabilities to be as broad as possible while remaining accessible and user-friendly. My goal was for the user not to have to write more than 3-5 lines of code in most scenarios.</p>\n<p>\\\nDuring the brainstorming process, I came up with the idea that it would be possible not only to track input but also to control it. For example, with code, one could simulate button presses or key combinations, move the mouse cursor, disable certain keys so that the system wouldn’t respond to their presses, or even change key bindings. All these features were implemented gradually through updates.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs soon as I finalized the set of features, I enthusiastically began development. Writing the code was not particularly challenging, but I focused on its structure and cleanliness so that other developers could easily understand what was done and why. During the development process, I conducted global refactoring several times, changing the organization and names, as well as extracting parts of the code into separate classes. I paid special attention to separating platform-dependent code (as I planned to create a cross-platform solution in the future) from the library code itself. This would prevent the need to rewrite the entire codebase when moving away from P/Invoke. I also took the time to add XML comments so that users of the library could understand what each method or class does.</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter completing the first version of the library, I uploaded it to <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/DeftSharp.Windows.Input\">NuGet</a> (the package management system for the .NET platform, similar to npm or pip). I wanted to receive some feedback to understand whether anyone was interested in this project and which direction I should take next. Before promoting my library, I decided to create a <em>README</em> file in the GitHub repository, including information about the library's goals and a brief guide on how to use it.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxnliqhgiz2qrmn157ywb.png\">  <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxnliqhgiz2qrmn157ywb.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"thefirstusers\">The First Users</h2>\n<p>I decided to search for my first users on <strong>Reddit</strong>. After finding several suitable communities, I wrote a brief post titled \"<em>Open Source C# Library for Handling Keyboard/Mouse Events in Windows UI Apps</em>\" It was a bit stressful, and honestly, I didn't expect any significant results. However, surprisingly, it paid off. One of the posts received about <strong>14,000</strong> views and approximately <strong>30</strong> comments with positive feedback. It was an incredible feeling that I wish everyone could experience: the realization that the time spent on the project was not in vain. Although I didn't create something groundbreaking, I understood that there are people who find it genuinely useful and who are willing to support my efforts.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdvhizvygf7kkdre4a9xv.png\">  <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdvhizvygf7kkdre4a9xv.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>After gathering all the feedback, I decided to continue the development and stay in touch with the most interested users who left comments. I actively communicated with them and listened to their requests for functionality they would like to see. Over the next month, I released several small updates and then refocused on attracting users.</p>\n<p>\\\nOn GitHub, there is a special type of repository called \"awesome\" — these are collections of links and resources compiled on specific topics, for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet\">awesome-dotnet</a>. My goal was to promote my library in each of these repositories. Although this was not an easy task — a library with 10-15 stars on GitHub does not attract much interest — I still managed to get into several of them. This significantly increased user traffic and drew attention to my project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1gpkeqlgpfd6t4q2y9xe.png\">  <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1gpkeqlgpfd6t4q2y9xe.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"communitycontributiontothedevelopment\">Community Contribution to the Development</h2>\n<p>During the further development, I encountered many small tasks for which I sometimes lacked the desire and energy to complete. So, I decided to take advantage of one of the benefits of open-source development — attracting enthusiasts who were willing to help with these tasks. To do this, I turned to the <a href=\"https://up-for-grabs.net/#/\">Up-for-Grabs</a> service, which provides a list of open-source repositories with active issues for those who want to contribute. After adding my repository and creating several issues, I immediately received requests for assistance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffcwse1yrdsogjs3n2ose.png\">  <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffcwse1yrdsogjs3n2ose.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>After my library was downloaded more than a thousand times, I decided to actively work on the documentation. Since the first update, the functionality of the library had significantly increased, and the examples in the <em>README</em> file were no longer sufficient. Of all the possible options, I chose the simplest and most accessible: I created a separate Markdown file and detailed all the classes offered by the library. I also decided to write a small guide for advanced users who want to make full use of the library's capabilities. To my surprise, a guy who specializes in writing technical documentation reached out to me and offered his help. He assisted me in properly structuring the material and accurately describing all the details. With his help, we quickly completed this task.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsj0apcw9ms458cc7vc8n.png\">  <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsj0apcw9ms458cc7vc8n.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Open-source development is a great opportunity to meet and expand your network with other programmers. So far, nine people from different countries have contributed to the library, including the United States, Australia, Argentina, Canada, Germany, Poland, and others. They have assisted in writing functionality, unit tests, and documentation. Moreover, it has been a wonderful exchange of experience and enjoyable communication. Perhaps with some of the contributors, we can start a new project together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4cf14v0en60ubhmwg0zs.png\">  <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4cf14v0en60ubhmwg0zs.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite having a job and other commitments, I want to continue development and release a full version with the features that I believe should be included in the library. My future plans include making it cross-platform and decoupling it from specific UI frameworks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, I would like to summarize everything I've said. Never be afraid to try something new and don't stand still. If you truly love programming and want to grow as a developer, strive to create something of your own — whether it’s a small library or a service. You never know where it might lead. Throughout the development of this library, I found joy not only in programming but also in meeting people and making new connections. I plan to continue engaging in open-source development, not only by advancing my own projects but also by contributing to community libraries — this is also a great experience.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor those who want to start engaging in open-source development, I recommend this <a href=\"https://opensource.guide/\">guide</a>!</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you enjoyed this post, I would be grateful if you could support <a href=\"https://github.com/Empiree/DeftSharp.Windows.Input\">the library</a> with a star on GitHub!</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/empiree/\">LinkedIn</a> / <a href=\"https://github.com/Empiree\">GitHub</a></p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"GIMP 3.0 RC2 Released With Bug Fixes Plus A Few Last Minute Features","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/GIMP-3.0-RC2-Released","date":1735344985,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"The long-awaited GIMP 3.0 image editing program that is a free software alternative to Adobe Photoshop will not see its stable release in 2024...
