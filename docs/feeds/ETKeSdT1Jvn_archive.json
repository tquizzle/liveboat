Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience. He has a proven track record of leading successful AI projects and building machine learning models from design to production across various domains, which have impacted millions of customers and have significantly improved business metrics, leading to millions of dollars of impact. He is currently an AI Lead at Intuit where he is one of the architects and developers of their Generative AI platform, which is serving Generative AI experiences for more than 100 million customers around the world.\n\nJineet is also a guest lecturer at Stanford University as part of their building LLM Applications class.

This never-enough-ness can lead to an ambient level of self-loathing that can be incredibly destructive. That's where \"radical self-love\" comes in.\n\nOur guest today is Sonya Renee Taylor. She is the author of three books, including The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love. She is the Founder and Radical Executive Officer of The Body is Not An Apology. She has come to this work as a result of her own personal pain, as a Black woman inhabiting a body that she says does not conform to societal norms. \n\nIn this conversation, we talk about defining radical self-love (and why she believes it's our natural state), tools for cultivating radical self-love, and the connection between being OK with yourself and the larger society. \nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/spmRMjwJdBQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // Robert Caulk // #279","url":"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Unleashing-Unconstrained-News-Knowledge-Graphs-to-Combat-Misinformation--Robert-Caulk--279-e2sis0d","date":1734712634,"author":"Demetrios Brinkmann","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<ituneshack><p><em></em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><em>Robert Caulk</em></a> is responsible for directing software development, enabling research, coordinating company projects, quality control, proposing external collaborations, and securing funding.

He received his Ph.D. from Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.\n\nUnleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.\n\n// Abstract\nIndexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.\n\nThe latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications. He is currently overseeing the structuring of hundreds of thousands of news articles per day in order to build the best news retrieval API in the world: https://asknews.app. \n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://emergentmethods.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://emergentmethods.ai</a></p>\n<p>News Retrieval API: <a href=\"https://asknews.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://asknews.app</a>\n \n--------------- ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">@mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Rob on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/</a></p>\n<p>\nTimestamps:\n[00:00] Rob's preferred coffee\n[00:05] Takeaways\n[00:55] Please like, share, leave a review, and subscribe to our MLOps channels!\n[01:00] Join our Local Organizer Carousel!\n[02:15] Knowledge Graphs and ontology\n[07:43] Ontology vs Noun Approach\n[12:46] Ephemeral tools for efficiency\n[17:26] Oracle to PostgreSQL migration\n[22:20] MEM Graph life cycle\n[29:14] Knowledge Graph Investigation Insights\n[33:37] Fine-tuning and distillation of LLMs\n[39:28] DAG workflow and quality control\n[46:23] Crawling nodes with Phi 3 Llama\n[50:05] AI pricing risks and strategies\n[56:14] Data labeling and poisoning\n[58:34] API costs vs News latency\n[1:02:10] Product focus and value\n[1:04:52] Ensuring reliable information\n[1:11:01] Podcast transcripts as News\n[1:13:08] Ontology trade-offs explained\n[1:15:00] Wrap up</p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/96087501/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-20%2F391880580-44100-2-d57545176debf.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"If You're Struggling with Low Self-Esteem, Watch This! | Mel Robbins","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GrJ1bqbSaY","date":1734712200,"author":"Mel Robbins","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Order my new book, The Let Them Theory üëâ https://bit.ly/let-them üëà It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

Before¬†<em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nDomino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua \"Alex\" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.\n\n// Abstract\nGiven the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.\n\n// Bio\nGuanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training.

We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  \n\nWe explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.  \n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VTBQQ2V\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/Eywd4Ly\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMate√≠na: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Shop: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Bernardo Huberman*\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-huberman-39b40823 \nX: https://x.com/bhuberman \nThe Laws of the Web (book): https://amzlink.to/az0I0G65K03ya \nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b_GVwg0AAAAJ \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo-Huberman \nCableLabs: https://www.cablelabs.com/blog/author/bhuberman \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Bernardo Huberman\n00:02:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:05:08 Early School, Science Interest, Argentina; Soccer\n00:12:29 Physics, Childhood Teacher, Family\n00:20:48 Music; Dictatorship; Humanistic Education\n00:29:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 US Graduate School \n00:39:27 Counterculture, Peer Pressure; Graduation, Job Search\n00:49:19 Xerox, Personal Computers; Risk-Takers, Tachyon\n00:54:49 Sponsors: LMNT & ExpressVPN\n00:57:33 Relativity Theory, Quantum Mechanics\n01:05:53 Chaos Theory, Fractals, Butterfly Effect\n01:17:21 Scientists, Positive Contributions & Flaws\n01:26:19 Sponsor: Mate√≠na\n01:27:45 Enjoyment of Life, Meditation; Goal Pursuit \n01:35:44 Changing Fields, Computers\n01:43:24 Mentors, Students; Restlessness, Curiosity\n01:47:41 Industry, Academia, Graduate Degrees\n01:54:02 Podcast, Interviewing; Mistakes, Working with Others\n02:05:48 Quantum Internet, Unbreakable Code\n02:09:48 Physics & Neuroscience; AI\n02:15:06 Analog vs. Digital Life, Thinking about Future\n02:21:38 Worry, Meditation\n02:24:22 Beliefs, God; Spiritual Experiences, Randomness\n02:33:53 Thinking about Past; Nostalgia\n02:39:19 Politically Incorrect; Libertarians; Cryogenics; Enjoying Life\n02:46:30 Joyful; Pushing to Limits; Worry & Enjoyment, Living with Elegance\n02:55:57 Etiquette, Clothing\n03:04:11 Retirement, Money, Travel\n03:12:00 Future Plans; Joyful Life\n03:13:33 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Curiosity #Science \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tR73Ny4Dt9s?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A Surprising Way To Influence People | Michael Morris","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjFBZqWoVCQ","date":1734343206,"author":"Ten Percent Happier","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Audio only. \n\nThe upside of the often misunderstood \"tribalism\".\n\nMichael Morris is the Chavkin-Chang Professor of Leadership at Columbia Business School as well as a Professor in its Psychology Department.

From gas attacks and bayonet wounds to rifle fire and artillery barrages, day-to-day life on the frontlines posed a serious risk to life and limb. The doctors and nurses responsible for medical care rose to the challenge, and the First World War saw a dramatic transformation in the provision of frontline medicine. Many more lives would be saved than lost due to the efforts of these 'lifesavers'.

However, supporting reinforcement learning, decision-making, and control communities is equally crucial, as these fields drive innovation in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and game-playing. This podcast explores the intersection of PyTorch and these fields, covering practical tips and tricks for working with PyTorch, an in-depth look at TorchRL, and discussions on debugging techniques, optimization strategies, and testing frameworks. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how to effectively use PyTorch for control systems and decision-making applications.\n\n// Bio\nVincent Moens is a research engineer on the PyTorch core team at Meta, based in London. As the maintainer of TorchRL (<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/rl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/rl</a>) and TensorDict (<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict</a>), Vincent plays a key role in supporting the decision-making community within the PyTorch ecosystem. \n\nAlongside his technical role in the PyTorch community, Vincent also actively contributes to AI-related research projects.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Vincent worked as an ML researcher at Huawei and AIG. \n\nVincent holds a Medical Degree and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links</p>\n<p>Musical recommendation: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uff91EOsvd99rtAupatMP?si=jVkoFiq8Tmq0fqK_OIEglg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uff91EOsvd99rtAupatMP?si=jVkoFiq8Tmq0fqK_OIEglg</a>\nWebsite: <a href=\"github.com/vmoens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">github.com/vmoens</a>\nTorchRL: <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/rl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/rl</a>\nTensorDict: <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict</a>\nLinkedIn post: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincent-moens-9bb91972_join-the-tensordict-discord-server-activity-7189297643322253312-Wo9J?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincent-moens-9bb91972_join-the-tensordict-discord-server-activity-7189297643322253312-Wo9J?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop</a>\n \n--------------- ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter:<a href=\" @mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"> @mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Vincent on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/</a></p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/95312154/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-3%2F390930188-44100-2-7d7396ed93203.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Roman Saturnalia","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roman-saturnalia","date":1733272258,"author":"","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<ituneshack><p>Episode 1 in our 'Origins of Christmas' series.

He highlights the impact of Generative AI on code transparency and explains the Generative AI Bill of Materials (GBOM), which helps identify and manage risks in AI-generated code. This talk offers practical insights for technical and non-technical audiences, showing how proper diligence can enhance value and mitigate risks in machine learning operations.\n\n// Bio\nMatt Van Itallie is the Founder and CEO of Sema. He and his team have developed Comprehensive Codebase Scans, the most thorough and easily understandable assessment of a codebase and engineering organization. These scans are crucial for private equity and venture capital firms looking to make informed investment decisions. Sema has evaluated code within organizations that have a collective value of over $1 trillion. In 2023, Sema served 7 of the 9 largest global investors, along with market-leading strategic investors, private equity, and venture capital firms, providing them with critical insights.\n\nIn addition, Sema is at the forefront of Generative AI Code Transparency, which measures how much code created by GenAI is in a codebase. They are the inventors behind the Generative AI Bill of Materials (GBOM), an essential resource for investors to understand and mitigate risks associated with AI-generated code.\n\nBefore founding Sema, Matt was a Private Equity operating executive and a management consultant at McKinsey. He graduated from Harvard Law School and has had some interesting adventures, like hiking a third of the Appalachian Trail and biking from Boston to Seattle.\n\nFull bio: https://alistar.fm/bio/matt-van-itallie\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gschwind\n \n--------------- ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Matt on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/\n\n</p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/95142779/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-10-29%2F390714674-44100-2-d09999f78d91e.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Greeks vs Persia: The War that Changed the Ancient World","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-greco-persian-wars-reshaping-the-ancient-world","date":1732840230,"author":"","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<ituneshack><p>In the 5th century BC, the ancient world's pre-eminent superpower turned its gaze towards the turbulent fringes of its empire.
