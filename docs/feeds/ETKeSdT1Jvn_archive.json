I also discuss topics like phantom limb pain, recovering from traumatic brain injury and the crucial role inflammation plays in the healing process. \n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes.

Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.\n\nThe positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.\n\nFind show notes with articles, resources and more: https://go.hubermanlab.com/MNDX54b\n\nPre-order Andrew's upcoming book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nDavid: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinui.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*More Huberman Lab*\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Merch: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Exercise, Brain Health & Performance; Protocols Book\n00:04:03 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Helix Sleep\n00:06:55 Brain Health, Cardiovascular & Resistance Training\n00:11:51 Exercise & Positive Impact on Brain Performance; Arousal\n00:18:20 Learning & Arousal\n00:23:18 Sponsors: AG1 & David\n00:26:01 Exercise & Acute Learning\n00:29:16 Tool: High-Intensity Training & Cognitive Flexibility; Over-Training\n00:33:32 Long-Term Brain Health; Tool: Exercise “Snacks”, Cognitive Performance\n00:36:57 Exercise, Brain & Body Energy, Adrenaline, Norepinephrine\n00:44:08 Adrenal “Burnout”?; Exercise to Increase Energy, Adrenaline\n00:48:20 Tool: Core, Compound Movements; Mind-Body Connection\n00:53:58 Sponsor: Function\n00:55:45 Bones, Osteocalcin, BDNF & Hippocampus; Tool: Jump Training\n01:01:30 Exercise, Fuel, Multifactorial Pathways; BDNF & Activity\n01:05:06 Lactate, Astrocytes & Brain Function; VEGF & Brain Health\n01:11:17 Tools: Zone 2, High-Intensity Training, Time Under Tension Training\n01:19:54 Sponsor: Maui Nui\n01:21:37 Tools: Time Under Tension; Explosive Jumping, Eccentric Control Training\n01:25:30 Injury & Exercise, Illness\n01:28:09 Sleep; Injury, Sleep-Deprivation & Exercise\n01:33:51 SuperAgers, Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex, Grit & Persistence\n01:42:04 Tool: Embrace Challenges; Deliberate Cold Exposure, Rope Flow\n01:47:39 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Exercise \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/J2oqi41dCNc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How to Achieve Any Goal You Have in 6 Simple Steps","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxJjAuG3qkQ","date":1736157642,"author":"Mel Robbins","unread":true,"content":"Order my new book, The Let Them Theory 👉 https://bit.ly/let-them 👈 It will forever change the way you think about relationships, control, and personal power.

Andrew, Michelle, and their MLOps team have been on a journey over the last 12 months to take their portfolio of circa 10 Machine Learning models in production and migrate them from an on-prem solution to a cloud-based environment. During the podcast, Michelle and Andrew share their reflections as well as some dos (and don’ts!) of managing the migration of an established portfolio.\n\n// Bio\nMichelle Marie Conway\nMichelle is a Lead Data Scientist in the high-performance data science team at Lloyds Banking Group. With deep expertise in managing production-level Python code and machine learning models, she has worked alongside fellow senior manager Andrew to drive the bank's transition to the Google Cloud Platform. Together, they have played a pivotal role in modernising the ML portfolio in collaboration with a remarkable ML Ops team.\n\nOriginally from Ireland and now based in London, Michelle blends her technical expertise with a love for the arts. \n\nAndrew Baker\nAndrew graduated from the University of Birmingham with a first-class honours degree in Mathematics and Music with a Year in Computer Science and joined Lloyds Banking Group on their Retail graduate scheme in 2015.\n\nSince 2021 Andrew has worked in the world of data, firstly in shaping the Retail data strategy and most recently as a Data Science Delivery Lead, growing and managing a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. He has built a high-performing team responsible for building and maintaining ML models in production for the Consumer Lending division of the bank.\n\nAndrew is motivated by the role that data science and ML can play in transforming the business and its processes, and is focused on balancing the power of ML with the need for simplicity and explainability that enables business users to engage with the opportunities that exist in this space and the demands of a highly regulated environment.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: https://www.michelleconway.co.uk/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-just-when-data-science-answer-andrew-baker-hfdge/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-conundrum-generative-ai-andrew-baker-qla7e/ \n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Michelle on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle--conway/\nConnect with Andrew on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-baker-90952289\n\n</p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/96561417/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-0-3%2F392469992-44100-2-bcad12a952aae.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Know your Worth in your Company","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu0Eq-QhHfc","date":1735920054,"author":"That Career Coach - Kendall Berg","unread":true,"content":"I made this video years ago…right before they hired 3 people to replace me LOL the reality is that doing your job well is important BUT it's only part of what makes you valuable to a company. \n\nReady to start taking control of your career?

I also discuss the two essential components of creativity and explain how to structure productive, creative work sessions. By combining biological tools — such as exercise, meals, hydration, and sleep — with subjective methods like music, I demonstrate how to tailor your approach to align with your unique biological rhythms and individual goals, fostering greater creativity and learning.\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes, approximately 30 minutes, focused on key scientific and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes.

Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life. \n\nWe also explore the innate human drive to create \"impact at a distance\" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time. \n\nListeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.\n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/3qKWtpF\n\nGet summaries, clips, and insights from this episode with Ask Huberman Lab, our zero-cost chat-based tool: https://go.hubermanlab.com/OKw9EDv\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nDavid: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*More Huberman Lab*\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Merch: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Jordan Peterson*\nWebsite: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com \nUniversity of Toronto academic profile: https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/jordan-peterson \nBooks: https://amzlink.to/az0woBkDzpJTZ\nThe Jordan B.

This never-enough-ness can lead to an ambient level of self-loathing that can be incredibly destructive. That's where \"radical self-love\" comes in.\n\nOur guest today is Sonya Renee Taylor. She is the author of three books, including The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love. She is the Founder and Radical Executive Officer of The Body is Not An Apology. She has come to this work as a result of her own personal pain, as a Black woman inhabiting a body that she says does not conform to societal norms. \n\nIn this conversation, we talk about defining radical self-love (and why she believes it's our natural state), tools for cultivating radical self-love, and the connection between being OK with yourself and the larger society. \nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/spmRMjwJdBQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Did you know THIS about defensiveness? #podcast #jayshetty #personaldevelopment","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZWvyhU0ErI","date":1735520058,"author":"Jay Shetty Podcast","unread":true,"content":"Episode Resources:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jayshetty\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jayshetty/\nhttps://x.com/jayshetty\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shettyjay/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@JayShettyPodcast\nhttp://jayshetty.me","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tZWvyhU0ErI?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Fall of Constantinople","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/constantinople-under-siege","date":1735518601,"author":"","unread":true,"content":"<ituneshack><p>May 1453 saw the siege that would lead to the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience.

Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications. He is currently overseeing the structuring of hundreds of thousands of news articles per day in order to build the best news retrieval API in the world: https://asknews.app. \n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://emergentmethods.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://emergentmethods.ai</a></p>\n<p>News Retrieval API: <a href=\"https://asknews.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://asknews.app</a>\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">@mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Rob on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/</a></p>\n<p>\nTimestamps:\n[00:00] Rob's preferred coffee\n[00:05] Takeaways\n[00:55] Please like, share, leave a review, and subscribe to our MLOps channels!\n[01:00] Join our Local Organizer Carousel!\n[02:15] Knowledge Graphs and ontology\n[07:43] Ontology vs Noun Approach\n[12:46] Ephemeral tools for efficiency\n[17:26] Oracle to PostgreSQL migration\n[22:20] MEM Graph life cycle\n[29:14] Knowledge Graph Investigation Insights\n[33:37] Fine-tuning and distillation of LLMs\n[39:28] DAG workflow and quality control\n[46:23] Crawling nodes with Phi 3 Llama\n[50:05] AI pricing risks and strategies\n[56:14] Data labeling and poisoning\n[58:34] API costs vs News latency\n[1:02:10] Product focus and value\n[1:04:52] Ensuring reliable information\n[1:11:01] Podcast transcripts as News\n[1:13:08] Ontology trade-offs explained\n[1:15:00] Wrap up</p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/96087501/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-20%2F391880580-44100-2-d57545176debf.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How the Mongols Changed the World","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/how-the-mongols-changed-the-world-","date":1734654603,"author":"","unread":true,"content":"<ituneshack><p>After the death of Chinggis Khan, the founder and first Emperor of the Mongol Empire, the land became the largest contiguous empire in history.</p><br><p>The Horde, the western portion of the Mongol empire, was the central node in the Eurasian commercial boom of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and was a conduit for exchanges across thousands of miles.

Before <em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nDomino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua \"Alex\" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.\n\n// Abstract\nGiven the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.\n\n// Bio\nGuanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training.

We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  \n\nWe explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.  \n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VTBQQ2V\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/Eywd4Ly\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Shop: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Bernardo Huberman*\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-huberman-39b40823 \nX: https://x.com/bhuberman \nThe Laws of the Web (book): https://amzlink.to/az0I0G65K03ya \nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b_GVwg0AAAAJ \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo-Huberman \nCableLabs: https://www.cablelabs.com/blog/author/bhuberman \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Bernardo Huberman\n00:02:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:05:08 Early School, Science Interest, Argentina; Soccer\n00:12:29 Physics, Childhood Teacher, Family\n00:20:48 Music; Dictatorship; Humanistic Education\n00:29:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 US Graduate School \n00:39:27 Counterculture, Peer Pressure; Graduation, Job Search\n00:49:19 Xerox, Personal Computers; Risk-Takers, Tachyon\n00:54:49 Sponsors: LMNT & ExpressVPN\n00:57:33 Relativity Theory, Quantum Mechanics\n01:05:53 Chaos Theory, Fractals, Butterfly Effect\n01:17:21 Scientists, Positive Contributions & Flaws\n01:26:19 Sponsor: Mateína\n01:27:45 Enjoyment of Life, Meditation; Goal Pursuit \n01:35:44 Changing Fields, Computers\n01:43:24 Mentors, Students; Restlessness, Curiosity\n01:47:41 Industry, Academia, Graduate Degrees\n01:54:02 Podcast, Interviewing; Mistakes, Working with Others\n02:05:48 Quantum Internet, Unbreakable Code\n02:09:48 Physics & Neuroscience; AI\n02:15:06 Analog vs. Digital Life, Thinking about Future\n02:21:38 Worry, Meditation\n02:24:22 Beliefs, God; Spiritual Experiences, Randomness\n02:33:53 Thinking about Past; Nostalgia\n02:39:19 Politically Incorrect; Libertarians; Cryogenics; Enjoying Life\n02:46:30 Joyful; Pushing to Limits; Worry & Enjoyment, Living with Elegance\n02:55:57 Etiquette, Clothing\n03:04:11 Retirement, Money, Travel\n03:12:00 Future Plans; Joyful Life\n03:13:33 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Curiosity #Science \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tR73Ny4Dt9s?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Cod Wars","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-cod-wars","date":1734309023,"author":"","unread":true,"content":"<ituneshack><p>In the long and lamentable history of human conflicts, the Cod Wars have to be among the most bizarre.
