In this episode with Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, we’re going to talk about how to tune into the value of disruption, and learn how to sit with the chaos. \n\nZenju Earthlyn Manuel is an ordained Zen priest, holds a Ph.D., and worked for decades as a social science researcher and development director for non-profit organizations. She is also a prolific author.\n\nIn this conversation we’ll explore: what to do with the unknown and not having any answers; the power of a “sip of silence” (her term); what she means by the phrase “death as a doorway to tenderness;” how she defines tenderness - a word that can easily get bogged down in sloppy sentimentality; and what she meant when she wrote “I'm not advocating love as an answer to all of the ills of the world. Then again, it is just that simple to be love.”\n\nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/K3VN-0pAMOQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Origins of Istanbul","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-origins-of-istanbul","date":1735259444,"author":"","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<ituneshack><p>Today we dig into the history of Istanbul, the city at the crossroads of East and West.

If someone doesn’t want to change—or isn’t ready—they won’t.\n\nInstead of getting frustrated, try saying “Let Them.” When you stop trying to control what they do, you give them the space to change on their own terms, if and when they’re ready. And in turn, you free yourself from the stress and responsibility of trying to manage things you can’t control.\n\nIn this episode of The Mel Robbins Podcast, I sat down with my oldest daughter, Sawyer, for a raw, transformative conversation about repairing relationships and closing the invisible distance we often feel with the people we love most.\n\nWatch the full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4h9-LIkvzA&list=UUk2U-Oqn7RXf-ydPqfSxG5g\n\n#melrobbins #melrobbinspodcast #letthemtheory\n\n—\nCatch full episodes of The Mel Robbins Podcast here on YouTube https://bit.ly/tmrp_playlist 📺\n\nListen to The Mel Robbins Podcast while you're on-the-go! https://link.chtbl.com/DAinFkFf?sid=listennow 🎧 Available wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts.

Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience.

This never-enough-ness can lead to an ambient level of self-loathing that can be incredibly destructive. That's where \"radical self-love\" comes in.\n\nOur guest today is Sonya Renee Taylor. She is the author of three books, including The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love. She is the Founder and Radical Executive Officer of The Body is Not An Apology. She has come to this work as a result of her own personal pain, as a Black woman inhabiting a body that she says does not conform to societal norms. \n\nIn this conversation, we talk about defining radical self-love (and why she believes it's our natural state), tools for cultivating radical self-love, and the connection between being OK with yourself and the larger society. \nLearn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/spmRMjwJdBQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // Robert Caulk // #279","url":"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Unleashing-Unconstrained-News-Knowledge-Graphs-to-Combat-Misinformation--Robert-Caulk--279-e2sis0d","date":1734712634,"author":"Demetrios Brinkmann","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<ituneshack><p><em></em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcaulk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><em>Robert Caulk</em></a> is responsible for directing software development, enabling research, coordinating company projects, quality control, proposing external collaborations, and securing funding.

He received his Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.\n\nUnleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.\n\n// Abstract\nIndexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.\n\nThe latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications.

Before <em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nDomino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua \"Alex\" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.\n\n// Abstract\nGiven the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.\n\n// Bio\nGuanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training.

We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  \n\nWe explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.  \n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VTBQQ2V\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/Eywd4Ly\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Shop: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Bernardo Huberman*\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-huberman-39b40823 \nX: https://x.com/bhuberman \nThe Laws of the Web (book): https://amzlink.to/az0I0G65K03ya \nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b_GVwg0AAAAJ \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo-Huberman \nCableLabs: https://www.cablelabs.com/blog/author/bhuberman \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Bernardo Huberman\n00:02:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:05:08 Early School, Science Interest, Argentina; Soccer\n00:12:29 Physics, Childhood Teacher, Family\n00:20:48 Music; Dictatorship; Humanistic Education\n00:29:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 US Graduate School \n00:39:27 Counterculture, Peer Pressure; Graduation, Job Search\n00:49:19 Xerox, Personal Computers; Risk-Takers, Tachyon\n00:54:49 Sponsors: LMNT & ExpressVPN\n00:57:33 Relativity Theory, Quantum Mechanics\n01:05:53 Chaos Theory, Fractals, Butterfly Effect\n01:17:21 Scientists, Positive Contributions & Flaws\n01:26:19 Sponsor: Mateína\n01:27:45 Enjoyment of Life, Meditation; Goal Pursuit \n01:35:44 Changing Fields, Computers\n01:43:24 Mentors, Students; Restlessness, Curiosity\n01:47:41 Industry, Academia, Graduate Degrees\n01:54:02 Podcast, Interviewing; Mistakes, Working with Others\n02:05:48 Quantum Internet, Unbreakable Code\n02:09:48 Physics & Neuroscience; AI\n02:15:06 Analog vs. Digital Life, Thinking about Future\n02:21:38 Worry, Meditation\n02:24:22 Beliefs, God; Spiritual Experiences, Randomness\n02:33:53 Thinking about Past; Nostalgia\n02:39:19 Politically Incorrect; Libertarians; Cryogenics; Enjoying Life\n02:46:30 Joyful; Pushing to Limits; Worry & Enjoyment, Living with Elegance\n02:55:57 Etiquette, Clothing\n03:04:11 Retirement, Money, Travel\n03:12:00 Future Plans; Joyful Life\n03:13:33 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Curiosity #Science \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tR73Ny4Dt9s?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A Surprising Way To Influence People | Michael Morris","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjFBZqWoVCQ","date":1734343206,"author":"Ten Percent Happier","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Audio only. \n\nThe upside of the often misunderstood \"tribalism\".\n\nMichael Morris is the Chavkin-Chang Professor of Leadership at Columbia Business School as well as a Professor in its Psychology Department.

The low-hanging use cases have largely been picked off. The next frontier will be AI coworkers who sit alongside knowledge workers, doing work side by side. At the infrastructure level, one of the most important primitives invented by man - the data center, is being fundamentally rethought in this new wave.\n\n// Bio\nAditya Naganath joined Kleiner Perkins’ investment team in 2022 with a focus on artificial intelligence, enterprise software applications, infrastructure and security. Prior to joining Kleiner Perkins, Aditya was a product manager at Google focusing on growth initiatives for the next billion users team. He previously was a technical lead at Palantir Technologies and formerly held software engineering roles at Twitter and Nextdoor, where he was a Kleiner Perkins fellow. Aditya earned a patent during his time at Twitter for a technical analytics product he co-created.\n\nOriginally from Mumbai India, Aditya graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and an MBA from Stanford University. Outside of work, you can find him playing guitar with a hard rock band, competing in chess or on the squash courts, and fostering puppies.

Here we are discussing if resistance training needs to be done \"to failure\" — the inability to further move the resistance in good form for that set. It turns out the answer is relevant if you are seeking hypertrophy and/or strength.\n\nKeep in mind that resistance training has been recommended by numerous guests on the podcast for both women and men regardless of whether you're seeking hypertrophy, or simply strength increases.

I also provide actionable tools for regulating sleep and wake cycles in babies and new parents.  \n\nThe episode emphasizes the critical role of circadian rhythms, influenced by factors like light exposure, temperature regulation, and eating schedules. Practical tools include using light to shift your circadian clock, understanding the role of temperature in sleep, and adopting strategies to improve rest without medication. Whether you’re a shift worker, a parent of a newborn, or someone facing sleep challenges, this episode offers valuable guidance for enhancing recovery and overall well-being.\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.\n\nRead the full show notes for this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/fH6CW5k\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction to Huberman Lab Essentials\n00:00:45 Understanding Circadian Rhythms\n00:02:26 Optimizing Light Exposure for Better Sleep\n00:04:56 Tools: Combating Jet Lag\n00:05:51 The Science of Jet Lag & Longevity\n00:09:32 Temperature Minimum: Key to Circadian Adjustment\n00:16:50 Melatonin: Uses & Misconceptions\n00:20:50 Shift Work: Managing Irregular Schedules\n00:23:06 Sleep Strategies for Different Age Groups\n00:25:31 Conclusion & Key Takeaways\n\n#HubermanLab #JetLag #ShiftWork\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/In9Bq4EJMZw?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Next.js 15 with Jimmy Lai and Tim Neutkens","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/12/05/next-js-15-with-jimmy-lai-and-tim-neutkens/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=next-js-15-with-jimmy-lai-and-tim-neutkens","date":1733392859,"author":"SEDaily","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> is an open source JavaScript framework developed by <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a>.

However, supporting reinforcement learning, decision-making, and control communities is equally crucial, as these fields drive innovation in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and game-playing. This podcast explores the intersection of PyTorch and these fields, covering practical tips and tricks for working with PyTorch, an in-depth look at TorchRL, and discussions on debugging techniques, optimization strategies, and testing frameworks. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how to effectively use PyTorch for control systems and decision-making applications.\n\n// Bio\nVincent Moens is a research engineer on the PyTorch core team at Meta, based in London.

However, the data show that while venting strengthens social bonds, it also makes both the complainer and the listener more unhappy and amplifies negative emotions for both parties. Essentially, venting is counterproductive if your goal is to feel better.\n\nThis is interesting, considering that nearly all of us are prone to venting to some degree.\n\nNote: The data on journaling (covered in this and a previous Huberman Lab episode) strongly suggest that processing bad experiences doesn’t do much to relieve the associated negative emotions.
