That’s also true, but it has the greatest power to positively impact your mitochondria. There’s also evidence that it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels in both men and women.\n\nEvery time I talk about this, people say, “There’s no sun here.” Unless you live in a cave, there’s sun. But it is true that on overcast days, long-wavelength light is filtered out.\n\nIt’s still important to get sunlight in your eyes on those days for circadian rhythm regulation. On overcast days, as well as when you need more mitochondrial stimulation, red light devices can be useful. Most of them emit both red light and infrared or near-infrared light.\n\nFull disclosure: Joovv is a sponsor of tge Huberman Lab podcast because, to my knowledge, those are the only medical-grade red and infrared light devices that are commercially available.\n\nOne of the really cool things about long-wavelength light, regardless of the source, is that it can penetrate deep into the skin and scatter as much as 8 cm.\n\nIn this post, I talk about how to avoid excess UV exposure while still getting plenty of long-wavelength light from the sun.\n\nI did an entire episode about light—Episode 4 of the Huberman Lab podcast. The episode out now with Roger Seheult, M.D., also covers this in detail, including how red light can improve blood glucose regulation.\n\nThe last point is that photobiomodulation is now considered a core component of dermatology and other fields of medicine.</article>","contentLength":1560,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/goCbY3zIZKo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"There are two types of rejection. #podcast #jayshetty #datingadvice","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdl1Yr3o-sU","date":1740938450,"author":"Jay Shetty Podcast","guid":594,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Episode Resources:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jayshetty\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jayshetty/\nhttps://x.com/jayshetty\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shettyjay/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@JayShettyPodcast\nhttp://jayshetty.me</article>","contentLength":216,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/tdl1Yr3o-sU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Here's the Secret of the Career Game #3 -Teaser from my Book!

But if you’re navigating grief, or supporting someone who is, there is something that can help.\n\nAndrew Garfield once described grief as “all the unexpressed love that I didn’t get to tell her.” It’s a powerful reminder that grief isn’t just pain, it’s love that still lives on.\n\nYou don’t ever \"get over\" a loss like this. You learn to carry it, to live with it, and to honor the love that remains. And no matter how impossible it feels right now, you don’t have to go through it alone.\n\nAs Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg wrote in Option B, the most powerful thing you can do for someone grieving is simply to remind them: You’re not alone.\n\nYou are stronger than you think.

Many people don’t want to be much bigger, but most everybody wants endurance. It’s possible to train for both simultaneously. It also turns out that training for strength with low repetitions (two to five reps) is safer than training with high repetitions—if done correctly. That’s because higher repetitions fatigue the stabilizing muscles. Still, there’s a proper way to train heavy, and Pavel explains it.\n\nHypertrophy training, or training for muscle size, is far more draining to the systemic nervous system than most people realize. So if you struggle with post-workout fatigue or experience brain fog later in the day, you might try training with heavier weights and lower repetitions for a while, focusing on strength instead.\n\nWe also discussed the longevity benefits of training for strength and endurance. And for those who want to add muscle size, Pavel explains shorter workouts that can be used to augment a strength program while minimizing inroads to recovery.\n\nAdditionally, we covered how to build flexibility, all with minimal time investment. Pavel is a true expert and a no-frills instructor.

It used to be that the first step of data science was to get familiar with your data. However, as modern LLM datasets have gotten larger, dataset exploration tools have not kept up. Kenny makes the case that user interfaces have been under-appreciated in the Python-centric world of AI, and new tools are needed to enable advances in machine learning. Our conversation also dives into new methods of using LLM models themselves to assist data engineers in actually looking at their data.</p><p>Kenny has been working in AI for over 20 years. First in academia as a ML Ph.D. student at USC (before it was cool). Kenny then co-founded Algorithmia to solve the problem of hosting and distribution of ML models running on GPUs (also before it was cool). Algortihmia was an early pioneer of the MLOps space and was acquired by DataRobot in 2021. Kenny is currently founder and CEO of Hyperparam, building new tools to make AI dataset curation orders of magnitude more efficient.</p><p> ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p>","contentLength":1415,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98686316/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-19%2F395182406-44100-2-112a6f4e517d4.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"\"Distant Self Talk\"","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAx7gWFQvtg","date":1739883947,"author":"10% Happier","guid":533,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Learn more about the 10% Happier podcast and join Dan and his community at www.danharris.com.\n\n#tenpercenthappier #10percent #danharris #meditation #mentalhealth #mindfulness #dharma #podcast #mindfulnessteacher #adults #anxiety #buddha #buddhism #fitness #health #interview #meditate #men #mental #help #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthtips  #mindfulnessmeditation #science #selfawareness #selfhelp #selfhealing #tph #tenpercenthappier #tenpercent #panicattack #panicattackrelief #anxietyrelief #anxietytips\n\nSubscribe to watch more 10% Happier videos: https://www.youtube.com/tenpercenthappier\n\nListen to the Full Podcast  https://link.chtbl.com/Y_729H6p\n \nFOLLOW DAN HARRIS ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/danharris/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@danbharris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanHarrisABC\nX: https://twitter.com/danbharris\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-harris-91ba5716b/\n\n10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris\nTune in to the 10% Happier podcast with Dan Harris for interviews with meditators, scientists, and authors on meditating, mental health, and much more.</article>","contentLength":1134,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ZAx7gWFQvtg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Docusign for Developers with Dan Selman and Larry Jin","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/18/the-docusign-developer-api-with-dan-selman-and-larry-jin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-docusign-developer-api-with-dan-selman-and-larry-jin","date":1739872828,"author":"SEDaily","guid":770,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Agreements and contracts are a fundamental innovation and govern everything from personal commitments to major financial decisions.

It is a symptom of how complex workflow orchestration has gotten. Is it a dominant trend or will we cycle back to “DAG specifications”? At Stitchfix, we had our own DSL that “compiled” into airflow DAGs and at MicroByre, we used a external workflow langauge. Both had a batch task executor on K8s but at MicroByre, we had human and robot in the loop workflows.// BioDr. Milowski is a serial entrepreneur and computer scientist with experience in a variety of data and machine learning technologies. He holds a PhD in Informatics (Computer Science) from the University of Edinburgh, where he researched large-scale computation over scientific data.

However, these models remain susceptible to significant security and safety vulnerabilities. Such weaknesses can enable attackers to jailbreak systems, allowing them to perform harmful tasks or leak sensitive information. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical applications like autonomous robotics and healthcare, the importance of ensuring AI safety is growing. Understanding the vulnerabilities in today’s AI systems is crucial to addressing these concerns.\n\n// Bio\nVinu Sankar Sadasivan is a final-year Computer Science PhD candidate at The University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi. His research focuses on Security and Privacy in AI, with a particular emphasis on AI robustness, detectability, and user privacy. Currently, Vinu is a full-time Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, working on jailbreaking multimodal AI models. Previously, Vinu was a Research Scientist intern at Meta FAIR in Paris, where he worked on AI watermarking.\n\nVinu is a recipient of the 2023 Kulkarni Fellowship and has earned several distinctions, including the prestigious Director’s Silver Medal. He completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar in 2020. Prior to their PhD, Vinu gained research experience as a Junior Research Fellow in the Data Science Lab at IIT Gandhinagar and through internships at Caltech, Microsoft Research India, and IISc.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: https://vinusankars.github.io/\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Richard on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinusankars/\n\n</p>","contentLength":2396,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98160978/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-7%2F394458992-44100-2-ab419176af6b.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["podcast"]}
