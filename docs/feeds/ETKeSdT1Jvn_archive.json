That‚Äôs also true, but it has the greatest power to positively impact your mitochondria. There‚Äôs also evidence that it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels in both men and women.\n\nEvery time I talk about this, people say, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no sun here.‚Äù Unless you live in a cave, there‚Äôs sun. But it is true that on overcast days, long-wavelength light is filtered out.\n\nIt‚Äôs still important to get sunlight in your eyes on those days for circadian rhythm regulation. On overcast days, as well as when you need more mitochondrial stimulation, red light devices can be useful. Most of them emit both red light and infrared or near-infrared light.\n\nFull disclosure: Joovv is a sponsor of tge Huberman Lab podcast because, to my knowledge, those are the only medical-grade red and infrared light devices that are commercially available.\n\nOne of the really cool things about long-wavelength light, regardless of the source, is that it can penetrate deep into the skin and scatter as much as 8 cm.\n\nIn this post, I talk about how to avoid excess UV exposure while still getting plenty of long-wavelength light from the sun.\n\nI did an entire episode about light‚ÄîEpisode 4 of the Huberman Lab podcast. The episode out now with Roger Seheult, M.D., also covers this in detail, including how red light can improve blood glucose regulation.\n\nThe last point is that photobiomodulation is now considered a core component of dermatology and other fields of medicine.</article>","contentLength":1560,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/goCbY3zIZKo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Kaizen!

Many people don‚Äôt want to be much bigger, but most everybody wants endurance. It‚Äôs possible to train for both simultaneously. It also turns out that training for strength with low repetitions (two to five reps) is safer than training with high repetitions‚Äîif done correctly. That‚Äôs because higher repetitions fatigue the stabilizing muscles. Still, there‚Äôs a proper way to train heavy, and Pavel explains it.\n\nHypertrophy training, or training for muscle size, is far more draining to the systemic nervous system than most people realize. So if you struggle with post-workout fatigue or experience brain fog later in the day, you might try training with heavier weights and lower repetitions for a while, focusing on strength instead.\n\nWe also discussed the longevity benefits of training for strength and endurance. And for those who want to add muscle size, Pavel explains shorter workouts that can be used to augment a strength program while minimizing inroads to recovery.\n\nAdditionally, we covered how to build flexibility, all with minimal time investment.
