What began as a \"friendly fork\" of CoreOS Container Linux has grown into a robust, independent, container-optimized Linux OS. The journey kicked off with a red CI dashboard daunting to many, almost-zero platform support, an unstructured release pipeline, a mammoth list of outdated packages, missing support for ARM architecture and more -- hardly a foundation for future initiatives atop. Over the years, countless human hours have been dedicated to transforming Flatcar, and I plan to discuss the initiatives we have undertaken, the war stories along the way, and the lessons we have learned as a team. The talk will also cover how we embrace new innovations and challenges while contributing back to the community. Attendees will gain insight into the challenges and rewards of maintaining a fast-moving Linux distribution and discover avenues to contribute to the Flatcar ecosystem.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/yZoev6NvkB0?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A Day in the Life of Kubernetes Release with Tools, Challenges, and Operations - Subhasmita Swain","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIEaoz9wcRE","date":1734632009,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Don't miss out!

But actually, how are releases cut? This talk is for cloud-native practitioners who care about the environmental impact of their work. Focusing on insight into daily life, the tools, and the methodologies, the release engineers have a strong identity of the ecological consideration at every step.\n\nWe'll explore key aspects such as the automation tools that streamline the release process, the challenges of ensuring efficient resource usage, and the design principles that promote sustainability. Through practical demonstrations, we'll showcase best practices like optimizing CI/CD pipelines and leveraging containerization for minimal resource consumption. Participants will be equipped with actionable knowledge to enhance the sustainability of their Kubernetes releases. The key takeaway would be how the existing tools could be adapted and shared by more of the project, like image promoters.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/uIEaoz9wcRE?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"containerd Packaging: Who Should Ship and How? - Akhil Mohan, containerd","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrEFji9AkiQ","date":1734632009,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Don't miss out!

While vendor distribution can be convenient, there can be surprising issues too. Another question arises: should we package other dependencies together with official release to ensure consistency? These considerations bring up a bigger discussion about best practices for distribution and packaging. We will be discussing perks and pitfalls of the different approaches to distributing core components in cloud native ecosystem like containerd and runc. Insights into how other projects handle their distribution could provide a valuable direction forward for the wider community. We also take a peek into the testing infrastructure that containerd uses to guarantee what we distribute is rock solid.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/lrEFji9AkiQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Hands-On Chaos Engineering Workshop with LitmusChaos and the Road to CNCF Graduation - Panel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCUnSpTvCt0","date":1734632009,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Don't miss out!

Reading existing tests lets you understand how a particular component works. You're also expected to write tests when making changes to the code base. The K8s codebase has different kinds of tests like unit, end to end and conformance tests. Given the scale of K8s, all of these are important to make sure that a feature works as intended and no edge cases come up when all the components are deployed in a production environment.\n\nIf you're getting started with contributing to K8s, learning the entire testing infrastructure can be overwhelming. This talk aims to give an introduction of the different types of tests in K8s and how you can setup your dev environment to run them locally. Along with unit tests, the talk also aims to give a demo of setting up tools like kubetest2 and hydrophone to run e2e and conformance tests with a kind cluster. After the talk you'll be ready to write your own tests for K8s and improve the test coverage.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/CH0H47Ov8fA?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Cloud Native Live: Enabling self-service for developers using K8s operators","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLcekxuKdgQ","date":1734588656,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Don't miss out!
