Anything left is tracked but not considered for future months.</p> </blockquote> <p>This approach has helped me stay in control of my money without the usual complexity found in financial tools that force you to budget every penny.</p> <p>For years, I relied on spreadsheets to do this, but as things got more complicated (multi-currency accounts, investments, custom rules, etc.), I wanted something more practical and powerful.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried them all, FireflyIII, Actual, Maybe, even paid options like Mobills and I couldn’t find anything that clicked with me — so I built WYGIWYH.</p> <h3>Why WYGIWYH?</h3> <p>The app is based on a few core ideas:</p> <ul> <li>Simplicity – Money management shouldn’t feel like extra work.</li> <li>No budgets – This isn’t a guilt-tracking app. It’s about understanding where your money goes, not bound by strict budget categories.</li> <li>Living month-to-month – Encourages using what you earn now, while protecting savings for future goals. It’s ideal for people who value clarity and flexibility over spreadsheets and overly structured finance apps.</li> </ul> <h3>Features</h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>Multi-currency support</strong>: Track multiple currencies for income, expenses, and savings without jumping through hoops. Great for those juggling multiple accounts or international transactions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Customizable transactions</strong>: Handle specific quirks like credit card billing cycles, installments, recurring transactions and transfer between accounts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Automation-ready API</strong>: Integrate it with your existing tools or automate expense tracking in the way that makes sense for your workflows.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Web-based and self-hosted</strong> (of course): Access it from anywhere through the browser, whether you’re on desktop or mobile, everything is fully responsive.</p></li> </ul> <h3>Who is WYGIWYH for?</h3> <p>It’s for anyone looking for a no-budget financial tracker with good multi-currency support. Ideal if:</p> <ul> <li>You don’t want a traditional budget but still want insight into where your money is going.</li> <li>You deal with multiple currencies and need a tool that can actually handle that properly.</li> <li>You’re frustrated with overly rigid personal finance tools like Mint, YNAB, or others.</li> </ul> <h3>Looking for feedback</h3> <p>Like many of you, I’m passionate about open and self-hosted solutions, so putting this out there to the community feels like the natural next step. If you decide to take WYGIWYH for a spin, I’d love your feedback — bugs, feature requests, or even philosophical takes on finance tracking!</p> <h3>Get started</h3> <p>The code and setup instructions are on GitHub:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/eitchtee/WYGIWYH\">WYGIWYH</a></p> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaips\"> /u/Flaips </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0e886/introducing_wygiwyh_a_powerful_personal_finance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0e886/introducing_wygiwyh_a_powerful_personal_finance/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Companies not accepting generic personal domain email","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0din2/companies_not_accepting_generic_personal_domain/","date":1736773600,"author":"/u/ServiceSoft9886","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’ve been migrating my emails to my personal domain email, <a href=\"mailto:contact@lastnamefirstname.com\">contact@lastnamefirstname.com</a>, so I can easily switch to a different email provider without being tied down.</p> <p>However, when I tried to change some of my emails on certain websites, they rejected generic emails like “contact”, “mail” and so on, even though the domain is my name and I am the only person using it.</p> <p>I’m curious to know how you all would handle this situation.</p> <p>Any input would be greatly appreciated.
